 ASTRONOMERS CALL FOR GLOBAL BAN ON SPACE ADVERTISING BEFORE IT'S TOO
LATE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Astronomers are calling for a global ban on space advertising,
warning that it threatens scientific research and the natural night
sky. The American Astronomical Society stated that obtrusive ads in
low Earth orbit should be prohibited through international agreements.
While the U.S. already bans domestic launches of space billboards,
companies in other countries, like Russia's Avant Space and
StartRocket, have explored the idea. Privatized spaceflight is growing
rapidly, making regulation more complex as private companies
prioritize commercial interests. Scientists argue that space
billboards would worsen light pollution, interfere with telescopes,
and diminish humanity's connection to the night sky. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG TEASES A 2025 RETURN TO ‘OG FACEBOOK' (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Meta plans to refresh Facebook in 2025 to attract younger users, as
Gen Z engagement has plummeted from 71% in 2014-2015 to 33% in 2024.
Mark Zuckerberg warned investors that the changes may impact
short-term revenue and hinted at a return to Facebook's early
features. Gen Z spends twice as much time on TikTok as the average
U.S. adult and prefers platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, making
Facebook's revival uncertain. Meta has attempted Gen Z-focused
redesigns and other strategies, but younger users continue to move
toward decentralized social networks and alternatives like RedNote.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PROCESS BEHIND EMPLOYEE-GENERATED CONTENT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Employee-generated content is reshaping brand social strategies.
Brands like Anthropologie, Sotheby's, and the Philadelphia Eagles are
using employees to create high-performing content. A well-structured
EGC program involves selecting employees who naturally enjoy content
creation, providing guidelines without stifling creativity, and
integrating EGC into broader brand storytelling. When done right, EGC
fosters deeper audience connections and enhances authenticity, making
brands more relatable and approachable to the customer. 

 INFLUENCER MARKETING CAMPAIGNS FAVOR LONG-TERM PARTNERSHIPS OVER
ONE-TIME ENGAGEMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The trend toward long-term influencer partnerships is growing, with
63% of brands favoring sustained collaborations. As a result, 62% are
working with more than 10 influencers. Brands are also prioritizing
content quality, with 37% ranking content production as their top
selection factor. This shift reflects a deeper focus on building
lasting relationships and measuring the direct impact on sales.

 PINTEREST'S 2025 MARKETING MOMENTS GUIDE (US) (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This guide goes beyond a standard calendar by categorizing key

 ALLOCATION MODELS: THE C-SUITE IMPERATIVE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Marketing leaders can use allocation models to prioritize resources
effectively and align teams. Explicit numerical allocations (e.g.,
80/20 or 70/30) clarify strategy and prevent teams from making
conflicting trade-offs. Growth potential, market opportunity,
strategic importance, and competition should influence allocations
beyond revenue alone. The article includes an example template of a
strategy investment allocation model.

 DEEP DIVE: DUTCH BROS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dutch Bros stands out by doing the opposite of Starbucks, focusing on
fast, cold, high-energy drinks and an experience built on personal
connections. Its employees, called "bro-istas," create a friendly,
high-energy atmosphere that makes the drive-thru feel like a social
event. The brand drives loyalty with a generous rewards program,
limited-edition merch and drink drops, and engaging social media that
feels authentic. Dutch Bros' approach has turned customers into
diehard fans who see it as more than just a coffee shop. Its success
comes from selling not just drinks, but hype, energy, and a sense of
belonging. 

 THE MYTH OF THE CONSIDERATION SET (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Consumers don't have a fixed “consideration set” - instead, brand
choices are fluid and shaped by context. Research shows that buyers
often consider just 1-3 brands, with decisions driven by immediate
needs, environments, and prior experiences rather than a predefined
list. Marketers can better influence purchasing behavior by focusing
on Category Entry Points (CEPs), which are mental cues that link
consumer situations to brands, rather than outdated consideration
metrics.
