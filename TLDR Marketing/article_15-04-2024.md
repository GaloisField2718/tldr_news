 GOOGLE BLOCKING LINKS TO CALIFORNIA NEWS OUTLETS FROM SEARCH RESULTS
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google has temporarily blocked links from local news outlets in
California from appearing in search results. This is in response to a

that articles share. The California bill is meant to support the local
journalism industry. The change applies only to some people using
Google in California, though it's not clear how many.

 AN EXTREMELY SHORT GUIDE TO B2B COPYWRITING (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This guide explains a 3-step B2B copywriting tactic that takes less
than 1 minute to apply. First, find job descriptions of the positions
your ICP is in, then use the ‚ÄòResponsibilities' section as guidance
for their top priorities. Turn these into headlines with power words
and emotions. B2B buyers never really care about your product - they
care about job security. This method helps show prospects why buying
your product will help them look good in front of their boss. The
guide includes examples of this type of messaging from UserGems,
Unbounce, and more.

substantial impact on campaign performance. 

 ENGINEERING AS MARKETING: CREATING FREE TOOLS TO DRIVE GROWTH (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Engineering as marketing consists of building tools that help
generate awareness and acquire new users. This strategy enables brands
to diversify from traditional marketing channels and solve more than
one use case for your target audience. Engineering as marketing can
take several formats, including interactive templates, calculators,
and data sets. To do this well, first identify user needs from user
interviews, keyword analysis, or support tickets. Build a simple tool
that solves a single use case, then promote it across the appropriate
channels.

 EVERYTHING MARKETING MANAGERS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT EMAIL SUBDOMAINS (12
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's important to consider using separate email subdomains within
your email program to track and manage reputation without different
activities affecting one another. If something happens with your root
or subdomain, such as a rise in spam complaints or a big swing in send
volume that lands you on a blocklist, they're less likely to affect
each other if they're separate. This guide covers scenarios that
benefit from an email subdomain, how many you need, and subdomain name
ideas and examples.

ACQUISITION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 With an estimated price range of $30B to $40B, Google's potential
HubSpot acquisition will be the largest Alphabet investment yet. The
move is a strategic response to shifting dynamics in data privacy and

through, Google will be able to tap into HubSpot's customer base,
including SMBs, while HubSpot would benefit from being integrated into
Google's ecosystem.
