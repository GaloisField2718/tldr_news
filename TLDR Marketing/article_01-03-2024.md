changes will be effective March 4th.

concern among advertisers. Reports indicate that entire teams have
been downsized, leading to frustrations about the perceived lack of
premium service despite significant ad spend on the platform. These

efficiency and streamline operations with benefits to its customers.

READ) [8] 

 Cognism increased its pipeline by 26% by adjusting LinkedIn Ads to
target job functions instead of job titles. Its team started by

title, and more. Based on this, they created specific segments from
their ICP to pursue. This resulted in an increase in engagement rate,
pipeline, and impression share among their targeted accounts.

 YOUR STARTUP ONLY NEEDS ONE GROWTH CHANNEL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 It‚Äôs a huge misconception that startups need to scale all channels
available to have a fighting chance. In reality, you only need one
growth channel to be successful. Dropbox grew from 100K to 33.9M users
almost exclusively through referrals. NerdWallet dominated SEO by
producing 500 pieces of content per month, resulting in $599M revenue
in 2023. MVMT, a direct-to-consumer watchmaker, cracked influencer
marketing early on and eventually sold to Movado for $100M. 

 GOAT‚ÄôS PATH TO PRODUCT-MARKET FIT ‚Äî HOW A FAKE SNEAKER SPARKED A
$4B IDEA (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GOAT's cofounders tried 3 different ventures before finally pivoting
to creating an authenticated luxury sneaker marketplace. Shortly after
launch, a poorly planned Black Friday promo crashed their site and
oversold inventory. Their users were furious, but the silver lining
was that this was a signal that they had finally achieved
product-market fit. From growing and expanding since then, the
cofounders have learned to prioritize reducing friction for users and
to go slow with expansion into new markets or products.
