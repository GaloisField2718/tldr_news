NEWS & TRENDS

 THE MARKETING JOB MARKET: HERE'S WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The marketing job market is challenging, with 68% of professionals
citing tougher conditions due to competition and insufficient employer
support. While salaries have dropped 3% to an average of $108,380,
most marketers believe they're underpaid by about 20%. Employers play
a crucial role in improving the market, as many issues stem from
company-level factors rather than external ones. Training gaps
persist, with only 35% finding current programs adequate, pushing
marketers toward third-party resources to gain skills in tech,
analytics, and leadership. 

 REPORT: SEE WHY SNAPCHAT IS A TOP SOCIAL SHOPPING PLATFORM IN EMEA (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A 2024 study by the National Research Group highlighted Snapchat as
the leading platform for social shopping in EMEA (Europe, Middle East,
and Africa) regions. Snapchat users are highly engaged, with 87%
saying they love to shop and 71% viewing it as a primary hobby,
compared to lower percentages on other platforms. Snapchatters are
also major spenders, outpacing others in categories like apparel
(+63%) and household items (+172%). The study also found that the
buying behavior of Snapchatters is more significantly impacted by
recommendations from family, friends, or other credible sources.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RISE OF MICRO-CONTENT: HOW TO KEEP EMAIL AUDIENCES ENGAGED IN
SECONDS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 73% of people prefer to scan blog posts rather than read them in
full, and 56% apply the same behavior to emails. Micro-content —
short-form elements like infographics, reviews, or videos — cater to
these skimmers by offering fast, engaging snippets. Incorporating
micro-content into emails improves engagement by matching audience
expectations for brevity and interactivity. 

 PRICING PAGE: 6 TIPS TO OPTIMIZE AND CONVERT UNDER PRESSURE (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Prioritize ethical price testing to understand customer value without
harming trust. Avoid discounting by maintaining stable prices while
offering value-added features. Target price-sensitive customers with
tiered pricing and loyalty programs. Consider free trials to showcase
premium features. Use comparison tactics by presenting a less
attractive option alongside your preferred package to guide decisions.


 B2B MARKETING CALLS-TO-ACTION: BEST PRACTICES BY CHANNEL (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 American companies are projected to spend nearly $60 billion on B2B
advertising in 2024. CTAs will play a critical role in maximizing
returns. Tailoring CTAs to specific channels, like email, social
media, or landing pages, ensures higher engagement by matching the
platform's user expectations. Effective CTAs align messaging across
platforms and benefit from A/B testing to optimize click-through and
conversion rates.

 MENTION A RIVAL TO GET MORE ENGAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Research shows that referencing a well-known rival in marketing
drives a 196.7% increase in engagement compared to posts without such
mentions. Referencing direct competitors is especially effective.
Rivalries that are familiar (like Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi) yield even
higher engagement. This is especially true among loyal customers, who
interact 20% more with these posts than neutral audiences. This tactic
does not statistically impact purchase intentions and negative rivalry
references may risk the brand's image if overused. Small-scale testing
of rival-based messaging should be done to assess consumer reactions
before broader use. 

 30 GEN AI CAMPAIGNS LATER, KLARNA CUTS ANNUAL MARKETING SPEND BY 12%
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Klarna leveraged generative AI to create nearly 30 campaigns in 2024,
using AI to generate ideas, visuals, and copy, reducing its sales and
marketing spending by 12%. This shift has cut image production costs
by $6 million annually, with a 25% decrease in external agency costs,
translating to $4 million in savings. Campaigns using AI saw
significant performance improvements, with click-through rates
increasing by 300%-400%, and email click-through rates rising from
0.5% to 2%. Klarna plans further workforce reductions, citing AI's
capabilities in streamlining production and maintaining brand
consistency. High-level creative work, like brand-defining campaigns,
still requires human input for distinctive, engaging ideas.
