NEWS & TRENDS

 TWO-THIRDS OF CONSUMERS WANT ‘EDUTAINMENT' CONTENT FROM BRANDS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 66% of consumers find “edutainment” content to be the most
engaging form of brand content. Instagram leads in usage, with 84% of
social media users, especially Gen Z and Millennials. Despite the
social media ecosystem becoming more complex, 48% of consumers have
engaged more with brand content in the last six months. TikTok is
favored by Gen Z for news (63%) and product discovery (77%). Facebook
remains a top platform for customer care amongst Baby Boomers and Gen
X. 

 ‘KINDNESS CONTENT' ON TIKTOK IS GETTING HATE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Critics argue that recording strangers for social media clout is
exploitative. Many creators film individuals without their consent,
often capitalizing on vulnerable situations for views and donations.
This raises ethical questions about the authenticity of their actions
and whether they genuinely help those in need. Despite the
controversy, these videos have popularized philanthropy among younger
audiences.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY BLOG POST TEMPLATES KILL CREATIVITY AND BETTER WAYS TO COMPETE
FOR ATTENTION IN 2025 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The average blog read time is 52 seconds, despite typical posts being
over 2,000 words which take 7+ minutes to read in full. This reflects
a disconnect between content creators and audience preferences.
Consumers increasingly seek concise, engaging formats like quizzes and
interactive tools rather than long-form blogs. In that context,
adapting content packaging with no-code tools and custom designs can
help brands compete effectively for attention. 

 HOW TO OPTIMIZE PPC CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST FOR B2B (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is key to determining how much to
invest in advertising for B2B lead generation. PPC leads often take
12-18 months to convert into sales, requiring tracking multiple
touchpoints across long sales cycles. Use offline conversion imports
from CRM platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot to measure the true
cost of acquiring customers and optimize for CAC. Use Google Ads
features like Smart Bidding, microconversions, and funnel stages to
improve advertising efficiency.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 SCOOP.IT (TOOL) [9] 

 Scoop.it helps users discover, organize, and share relevant content
across various channels. It offers a content suggestion engine that
generates topics based on user-defined keywords and integrates with
third-party tools like Mailchimp and HubSpot to enhance content
distribution. Users can curate content from multiple sources such as
RSS feeds, X, and other platforms to create curated content for blogs,
newsletters, and social media. 

 GOOGLE SHAKES UP AD AUCTION DYNAMICS FOR HOLIDAY SHOPPING (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google is changing how Performance Max and Standard Shopping
campaigns compete in ad auctions, basing the winner on Ad Rank rather
than automatically favoring Performance Max. This update provides
advertisers with more flexibility, especially for the holiday season,
but will require adjustments to budgets and strategies.

 THE SUPER SATISFYING WAY TO DEAL WITH HATE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Polarizing opinions — whether love or hate — indicate your brand
is getting attention. Handling criticism effectively involves
understanding complaints, engaging critics in their spaces, and using
humor to diffuse tension. This approach shifts the narrative from
backlash to conversation, creating opportunities for stronger customer
relationships. 

 IS THE BUBBLE FINALLY POPPING? WILLINGNESS TO PAY (WTP) IN MARTECH
SAAS PRICING (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 61% of businesses cited price as the main reason for switching
MarTech tools. The shift toward cost-consciousness puts pressure on
SaaS companies relying on Willingness to Pay (WTP) pricing models,
which previously allowed them to charge based on perceived value. As
market conditions evolve, WTP faces challenges, with cost-plus pricing
emerging as a more stable alternative in saturated markets. 

 GROWTH TEAMS SHOULD STAY IN A FOUNDER MODE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Founder Mode is a growth mindset where teams prioritize hands-on
creativity and rapid decision-making instead of managerial tasks to
drive innovation. Growth teams benefit from this approach, as constant
adaptation and bold experimentation are needed to prevent stagnation
in fast-changing markets. By staying nimble, connecting with customer
insights, and fostering collaboration, growth teams can unlock new
opportunities and prevent performance plateaus. Relying on best
practices alone leads to mediocrity, while bold, out-of-the-box
thinking fuels category-defining success.
