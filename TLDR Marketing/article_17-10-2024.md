 DATA: ENGAGEMENT RATE OF 1.2 MILLION AI-ASSISTED POSTS VS HUMAN-ONLY
(5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 An analysis of 1.2 million social media posts found that AI tools
help users create more content quickly, leading to higher engagement
rates. AI-assisted posts average a 5.87% engagement rate, compared to
4.82% for non-AI-assisted posts. Significant gains were seen on
platforms like Threads, where engagement for AI-assisted posts reached

adjustments, companies should consider how they would dismantle their
GTM process to reveal overlooked flaws caused by familiarity. This
approach enables organizations to rebuild a more efficient and focused
strategy by targeting ideal customers, removing bottlenecks, and
empowering sales teams. Inverting thinking leads to a stronger, more
