NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK PARTNERS WITH AMAZON FOR IN-APP SHOPPING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok's collaboration with Amazon brings in-app shopping to users'
feeds, enabling them to buy products directly through the app. For
advertisers, this means a new, frictionless way to convert TikTok's
highly engaged audience into customers. As Amazon strengthens its
foothold in social media, this partnership could set a new standard in
social commerce. 

 VIRAL MARKETING STUNTS MADE 'DEADPOOL' A $1BN HIT, SAYS DISNEY EXEC
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Disney's chief brand officer credits the $1 billion success of
"Deadpool & Wolverine" to unconventional marketing stunts, including
cameos in K-pop videos and cooking shows, that resonate with Gen Z
audiences. Stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman took their
in-character antics to new levels, creating viral content that cut
through the noise of traditional marketing. This approach highlights
the growing importance of meme-ready, platform-specific content to
engage younger viewers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GONG'S CONTENT AND SEO STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gong has a two-part SEO content strategy that targets
bottom-of-funnel, high-intent keywords via the marketing site and
top-of-funnel, low-intent keywords via the blog. This is a common
strategy and the brand is executing well on the marketing site, but
the blog is being wasted on informational content that doesn't
convert. Gong should create blog content on comparison/alternatives
and jobs-to-be-done, which would bring in more qualified traffic. 

 THE HOTTEST MARKETING TREND RIGHT NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A popular tactic currently is "Mini-Games Marketing," where brands
use simple games to capture and retain user attention. Inspired by
Toggl's "Startup Simulator," companies like LinkedIn, YouTube, and
Netflix have adopted mini-games to increase interaction. These games
work because they keep users on-site longer, foster brand loyalty (by
making users feel understood), and have high viral potential, as
players share scores and challenges. Mini-games also stand out by
being a more memorable experience compared to traditional content. 

 ARE YOUR INSTAGRAM CAMPAIGNS SABOTAGING YOUR BRAND'S REACH? (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Marketers should reconsider posting campaign assets on Instagram, as
overuse often causes significant drops in reach and engagement that
take months to recover. They should instead assess Instagram
performance before, during, and after a campaign to understand the
impact. Prioritizing aesthetics over performance can lead to
diminished visibility and less interaction. Thoughtful upper-funnel
marketing is important. Social teams should gather data to avoid these
issues.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 OPEN SOURCE TOOLS TO BOOST YOUR PRODUCTIVITY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 By exploring open source tools like Penpot, Cal.com, and Nextcloud,
marketers can find robust alternatives to proprietary software that
prioritize transparency and customization. These community-driven
solutions offer greater control and flexibility, appealing to those
who value freedom and collaboration. While there may be trade-offs,
these tools can significantly boost productivity without making you
dependent on a few large tech companies. 

 WIX: KEYWORD DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT MATRIX (GOOGLE SHEET) [11]

difficulty. It includes freshness signals, on-page elements, and the
presence of AI Overviews. Instead of an ambiguous 1-100 scale, your
keyword list will show a ranking difficulty of Easy, Medium, or
Difficult. You can also link back to the matrix to explain the
ranking.

 THE HARD-HITTING TRUTH ABOUT WHAT REALLY BUILDS YOUR BRAND (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Credibility is the missing link that sets successful brands apart
from those that struggle. It can be gained through demonstrating
results, such as testimonials, case studies, and reviews that show how
you have helped others. Creating valuable content also has this
effect, but it's worth considering that different mediums have
different levels of impact. Credibility can also be gained through
association with others, either through collaborations or when they
engage with your content publicly. 

 GOOGLE'S ‚ÄúDEAR SYDNEY‚Äù AD WAS A MISSTEP. WHAT MARKETERS CAN LEARN
FROM IT (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's "Dear Sydney" ad, created for the Olympics, faced backlash
for using AI to write a letter on behalf of a child. Critics labeled
it "tone deaf" and "anti-human." The ad depicted a father relying on
AI to craft a message to athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. Experts
expressed concerns about AI replacing human creativity, particularly
in children's development. While Google aimed to showcase AI as a tool
for enhancing creativity, the message promoted technology over genuine
interaction. The ad was eventually pulled after receiving widespread
criticism.
