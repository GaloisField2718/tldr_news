NEWS & TRENDS

 MARKETERS SEE THEMSELVES AS ‘BOLD', BUT THEY AREN'T (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 A survey by DMEXCO found that 75% of marketers view a bold brand
presence as critical to success and 81% expect its importance to grow
in the next five years. While 64% considered themselves bold, only 8%
said they had communicated in a strikingly bold way, 6.6% had launched
a risky campaign, and 5% had taken a controversial stance. The boldest
actions reported were entering new markets (17.4%), targeting untapped
groups (10.7%), and publicly supporting a cause (8.8%). Fear of social
media backlash (47%), concern for brand image (45.6%), and legal
uncertainty (45%) were the main barriers holding marketers back. 

 THE 12TH ANNUAL BLOGGER SURVEY: WHAT CONTENT WORKS IN 2025? (17
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Long-form, highly visual content, influencer collaborations, and
original research drove the strongest results. Publishing 2,000+ word
articles led to 39% reporting strong results, while frequent
influencer collaborations reached 37%, both above the 21% benchmark.
Consistently using analytics improved outcomes, with 32% reporting
strong results. Paid promotion and guest blogging also correlated with
success, with 30% reporting strong results. Shortcuts like fully
AI-written articles or ignoring analytics correlated with weaker
performance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STUCK IN NEUTRAL: REGAINING MOMENTUM AFTER REACTIVATION MISSES (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Buffer tested reactivation using timing, content, and
personalization, but most efforts had little impact. Nudges at day 7
or 13, feature highlights, and repurposed weekly report emails
produced minimal results. Personalizing emails and adding posting
prompts for Facebook, LinkedIn, and Bluesky drove a modest +16% lift.
Meanwhile, activation experiments like onboarding improvements,
streak-at-risk emails, and goal-based nudges achieved better results.
Reactivation requires high effort for low return, whereas activation
builds habits early and shows scalable impact. 

 USE REDDIT TO EXTRACT CHATS FOR YOUR CONTENT FUNNELS (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Search Reddit using ‘site:reddit.com' plus your target keywords and
filter posts from the past month. Identify relevant feeds, export the
conversations, and use AI to extract key motives, pain points, and
topics. Segment the insights into your content plan and create
targeted assets such as landing pages, FAQs, videos, and blog posts
that address real customer needs. This process finds relevant content
ideas to “help” our audiences.

 LINKEDIN GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Growth on LinkedIn requires treating the platform as both a
networking hub and a conversion tool. Focus your efforts on commenting
meaningfully, messaging peers, and nurturing your niche. Post only
when the message is strong, and structure your content around four key
pillars: educational to establish credibility, broad themes to drive
reach, sales content to activate opportunities, and personal stories
to build trust. Before launching into any content strategy, refine
your profile. It should speak directly to your target audience,
highlight your offer clearly, and include a strong call to action
above the fold.

 POSTED IS BETTER THAN PERFECT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Wimbledon's social strategy proves that speed, structure, and
storytelling can drive massive impact. With nearly 6,000 posts in six
weeks and over 2.7 billion video views, the team operated like a
digital newsroom. Their guiding principles of ‘posted is better than
perfect' and ‘emotion over production' enabled a high-volume output
without sacrificing audience connection. Their content framework
(campfire, bonfire, and firework) helped allocate resources
efficiently across evergreen, mid-level, and high-impact content. 

 BRAND VS. DEMAND IN THE AGE OF AI: THE BALANCING ACT FOR CMOS (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brand investment is regaining importance as AI-native companies shift
focus from pure demand generation to building strong identities that
differentiate them in crowded markets. Firms like OpenAI, Anthropic,
Cursor, and Lovable emphasize brand, communications, and community
over heavily paid campaigns, using mission, voice, and customer
experience as growth drivers. Lovable's growth highlights how brand
identity and experience can accelerate demand, with customers and
influencers drawn to its approachable and human positioning. For CMOs,
the challenge now is balancing demand with brand, as companies that
lean only on demand risk blending into the noise, while the strongest
growth comes from orchestrating both. 

 HOW SOFTWARE COMPANIES BECOME CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Companies rooted in digital products are turning to physical
publishing to create permanence, scarcity, and cultural weight.
37signals used books like Rework to turn company philosophies into
both profit and marketing, generating customers and employees aligned
with its values. Google launched Chrome with a printed comic that made
the abstract browser feel tangible and collectible. Airbnb created
Airbnbmag to position itself as a lifestyle brand, Stripe built Stripe
Press to associate itself with intellectual authority, and Midjourney
launched a magazine to give AI art legitimacy and scarcity. This
strategy transforms digital brands into institutions with influence
that extends beyond software.
