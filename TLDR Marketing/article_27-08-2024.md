MONTH: REPORT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 87% of shoppers make at least half of their purchases online, while
39% of consumers return an item purchased online at least once a
month. 52% of consumers say they have submitted a fake return at least
once in their lifetime, up from 36% last year. The majority of

return options. 

 GOOGLE JUST BACKED A $250M DEAL WITH CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT JOURNALISM
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 California's journalism industry has lost 68% of its workforce since
2005, prompting a $250 million deal with Google to support local
newsrooms. The deal, which circumvents legislative efforts to tax tech
companies, has been met with skepticism for its limited scope and the
exclusion of other tech giants. Funds from the deal will be allocated
over 5 years, with a focus on supporting underrepresented groups and
AI innovation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LINKEDIN PLAYBOOK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 It's ideal to post on LinkedIn 2-3 times per week, spending 15
minutes engaging with replies before spending another 15 minutes
interacting with other people's posts. Vary your post formats, as
using the same one repeatedly can reduce your reach by 30%. Post new
content between 10 am and noon, or when your followers tend to be
online. LinkedIn determines how valuable the post is and whether or
not to show it on other people's feeds during the first hour after you
post.

 GET AHEAD OF THE WHITE HOUSE'S ‚ÄúTIME IS MONEY‚Äù MANDATE (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The ‚ÄúTime is Money‚Äù White House initiative takes aim at bad
corporate customer experience practices like customer service ‚Äúdoom
loops‚Äù and problems with chatbots. 70% of customers struggle to
reach a live representative, while 68.5% are dissatisfied with
automated customer service, feeling trapped in systems that don't
resolve their issues. 1 in 4 customers cite poor follow-up and lack of
communication as key frustrations. Brands should invest in
conversational intelligence tools, enhance existing automated systems,
integrate customer interactions across channels, and close the loop
with every customer that reaches out. 

 EVERGREEN STRATEGY AND REDDIT/AI (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reddit's visibility in Google search results increased by 1,328% from
July 2023 to April 2024, prompting publishers to rethink their
audience strategies. While Google's AI Overviews have declined in
visibility, the emphasis on user-generated content, particularly from
forums like Reddit, challenges traditional content approaches.
Newsrooms are now experimenting with using Reddit for content
inspiration and audience engagement, acknowledging the growing
importance of experience-based content. 

 ACCELERATE CUSTOMER TIME TO VALUE WITH CUSTOMER VALUE MAPPING (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Time to Value is a critical metric in Customer Value Mapping (CVM),
which reorients the customer journey to prioritize faster ROI. The CVM
process begins by identifying delays and disconnects in the current
customer experience and designing an improved "to-be" experience that
eliminates these inefficiencies. The outcome is a cohesive
go-to-market roadmap that ensures alignment across teams and quicker
delivery of customer value.
