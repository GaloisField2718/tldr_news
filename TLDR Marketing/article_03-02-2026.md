NEWS & TRENDS

 LABELLING SOCIAL MEDIA ‘ADDICTIVE' IS TOO SIMPLISTIC (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A new study challenges the idea that social media is inherently
addictive for teens. It shows that both heavy use and complete
abstinence can harm well-being. Researchers found a “sweet spot”
where moderate use supports happiness, life satisfaction, and school
engagement, with patterns varying by age and gender. Girls face higher
risks from heavy use, while older boys may struggle if disconnected.
Experts suggest balanced digital engagement with age-appropriate
limits is more effective than blanket bans. 

 THE RISE OF IN-CAR ADS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Automakers are exploring infotainment screens as a major source of ad
revenue. They're integrating subtle promotions like nearby restaurants
or gas stations into connected car systems while phasing out
phone-mirroring interfaces like CarPlay and Android Auto. Companies
like 4screen partner with multiple brands to deliver nonintrusive,
utility-focused ads. Ford has patented systems to target ads via
cameras or audio. With 97% of new cars connected and potential
e-commerce revenue of $100-120 per car by 2030, the in-car ad market
could exceed $50B globally.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE 3-EMAIL CART & CHECKOUT ABANDONMENT FLOWS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cart abandoners add items to their cart but never start checkout.
They're usually browsing or comparing products. Checkout abandoners
enter their email or shipping info and were ready to buy but got
interrupted. Both flows convert by targeting users with intent,
removing friction, and nudging completion. The 3-email framework sends
reminders at 1 hour, 24 hours, and 48-72 hours. It progresses from a
gentle nudge, to objection handling, and a final push with urgency. 

 5 WAYS TO REFRAME YOUR PRICING AND PACKAGING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This piece shares how SaaS teams can reframe pricing to drive growth
and retention. Klaviyo redesigned its pricing page to spotlight its
free plan. Lindy repositioned Enterprise around outcomes by centering
its AI Assistant. Eden AI reframed Professional Services as part of an
Advanced AI Platform to support recurring revenue. DeepBrain made
annual plans the default to anchor larger commitments. Hugging Face
elevated Data Storage as a core add-on to increase stickiness and
recurring revenue.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GSC DATA IS 75% INCOMPLETE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 GSC is unreliable as a single source because Google filters about 75%
of impressions and 38% of clicks for privacy. An analysis of 10 B2B
SaaS sites with ~450M impressions found filtering from 59.3% to 93.6%
for impressions and up to 88.5% for clicks, leaving large gaps in
query data. AI Overviews surged in 2025 and correlate with a 56.6%
click drop since March, while impressions fluctuated due to scraper
activity. Bots also inflate impressions by 0.2% to 6.5%. Relying only
on GSC can mislead teams, so use multiple data sources and sampling
checks. 

 FROM CLAWDBOT TO MOLTBOT TO OPENCLAW: THE AI AGENT GENERATING BUZZ
AND FEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent launched weeks ago by Peter
Steinberger, has surged to over 145,000 GitHub stars as interest grows
in agents that can autonomously act across operating systems. The tool
runs directly on user devices and connects to models like Claude or
ChatGPT. It can manage emails, calendars, files, shopping, and web
tasks using persistent memory. Security firms, including Palo Alto
Networks and Cisco, have warned that its deep system access creates
serious risks around data leakage, malicious commands, and enterprise
safety.
