NEWS & TRENDS

MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The California Governor signed a bill that aims to reduce social
media use among children. This is the latest state effort to regulate
the medium over increasing concerns that heavy use is damaging to
young people. The bill makes it unlawful for online services and
applications to provide an ‚Äúaddictive feed‚Äù to minors or send them
notifications at certain times during the school year. The bill takes
effect on January 1, 2027. 

 TIKTOK INTRODUCES SEARCH ADS CAMPAIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Search Ads Campaign allows advertisers to reach high-intent audiences
with keyword-based ads on the TikTok search results page. This
campaign type allows brands to deliver personalized content at
critical decision-making moments. Running Search Ads alongside In-Feed
Ads typically results in a 20% average increase in conversions, often
at a similar or lower CPA. Additionally, 18% of users who initially
engage with an In-Feed Ad convert after seeing the corresponding
Search Ad.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO STREAMLINE CONTENT APPROVAL (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To avoid delays from conflicting feedback, create a document
outlining 3 levels of stakeholders during the project planning phase.
Identify Subject Matter Experts whose insights align with your
audience, followed by a small group of key approvers (ie. 1-2 people)
who determine whether the project moves forward. Lastly, include
informed partners who will promote the content, incorporating their
feedback at your discretion and framing updates as progress reports
rather than requests for action. This framework clarifies feedback
expectations, helps you stay on track, and prioritizes your audience's
needs.

 PERCEIVED VALUE: HOW TO CREATE MORE CUSTOMER VALUE WITHOUT CHANGING
THE PRODUCT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Understanding what matters to your customer base allows you to
position a product better. Perceived value is the difference between a
product's positive factors and its negative ones. Elements that
increase customer value include expectations, brand associations,
social proof, and functional or emotional benefits. Negative factors
include unmet needs, cost, unmet expectations, and negative
associations. 

 5 MEGATRENDS SHAPING THE FUTURE OF GO-TO-MARKET (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 As SaaS growth stagnates, there is a shift toward "Service as
Software," where companies prioritize delivering customer solutions
over merely selling software licenses. Traditional GTM playbooks are
also becoming obsolete. Personalized outreach and efficiency are
replacing mass marketing tactics. Businesses must focus on integrated
solutions that deliver quick ROI, as customers demand seamless
technology stacks. Ultimately, those who can integrate specialized
tools into cohesive strategies will thrive, while specialists risk
becoming obsolete. 

 THE CONTENT ATTRIBUTION SURVIVAL GUIDE (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sophisticated attribution is only necessary when there are high
stakes involved. For smaller businesses or when stakes are lower, it
may be worth it to rely on intuition rather than complex attribution
models. That said, no matter your setup, sticking with a consistent
attribution method is critical to track progress over time and have
historical data to compare against.
