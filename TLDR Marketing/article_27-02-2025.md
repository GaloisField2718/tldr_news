 IN-CAR ADVERTISING GLITCH MAY BE PREVIEW OF A DISTRACTING FUTURE (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Automakers are increasingly testing in-car advertising and
software-based upsells, with the connected vehicle services market
expected to surpass $1.68 billion by 2032. A Jeep glitch that
triggered intrusive ads while driving revealed the risks of this
strategy. Safety advocates warn that pop-ups create dangerous
distractions. While brands see digital features as a revenue goldmine,
backlash against intrusive monetization suggests consumer patience is
wearing thin.

 5 QUALITIES OF A GROWTH CONTENT STRATEGY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A growth-focused content strategy ensures consistency and avoids
reactive, trend-driven content. It should be based on deep audience
insights, including beliefs, challenges, and decision-making
processes. A clear, unique perspective should thread through all
content, reinforcing the brand's positioning. A structured system for
ongoing assessment and refinement, rather than constantly creating new
content from scratch, is essential to improving effectiveness.

 ROI VS. VOI: SMART MARKETERS LOOK BEYOND THE NUMBERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 While ROI measures immediate financial returns, Value on Investment
(VOI) includes intangible factors like brand awareness, customer
satisfaction, and community engagement. ROI is best for trackable
efforts, like digital advertising campaigns and lead generation, where
immediate results are clear. VOI, on the other hand, applies to
initiatives like brand awareness or employee training, where value
builds over time. A balanced approach that uses both ROI and VOI
ensures marketers capture both immediate results and long-term brand
growth.

providers while weakening mid-tier retailers and generic brands. AI
agent optimization (AAO) is becoming the next frontier in digital
marketing, with potential to replace search engine optimization (SEO).
