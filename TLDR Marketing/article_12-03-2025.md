NEWS & TRENDS

 BRANDS HIRE GEN X AND BOOMER INFLUENCERS AS THE ‘POWER OF THE
SILVER INFLUENCER' RISES (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Influencer marketing is evolving beyond Gen Z as brands realize the
potential of Gen X and Boomer creators to engage both older and
younger audiences. Progresso's partnerships with Retirement House and
Patti Roberts, along with Harmless Harvest's focus on senior
influencers, are examples of how brands are diversifying their creator
strategies beyond the usual younger demographics. 

 WHAT COMES AFTER SEARCH? AN ‘EXISTENTIAL' QUESTION FOR THE INTERNET
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The search-driven business model of the internet is becoming
obsolete. AI-powered search is forcing a major shift. One proposed
solution involves giving content creators control over AI crawlers,
monetizing access through rate cards, and preventing unrestricted
content scraping. The goal would be to sustain original content
creation while ensuring free access for human users.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN TO MAKE YOUR PRODUCT LOOK COMPLEX (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 People are willing to pay more for visually complex products when
they are compared directly to simpler alternatives. In a series of
experiments, participants were willing to pay 10.1% to 13.7% more for
complex-looking stationery and assumed such products cost 29% more to
produce. However, this effect disappeared when items were displayed
separately or when people were told both versions require the same
effort to make. Simpler packaging is preferred for products associated
with purity, like health foods, and cultural differences may influence
these perceptions. 

 3 DRAFTS TO RE-WRITE YOUR HOMEPAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The first draft maps key arguments and structure, ensuring clarity in
how your product is presented. The second draft introduces real copy,
often revealing misalignment with the strategy, making it an important
step for refining messaging before finalizing content. The third draft
polishes the copy for production, balancing clarity and creativity,
with a reminder that perfection isn't the goal. Focus on iterating and
shipping instead of aiming for perfection. 

 HOW LOVABLE GREW TO $17M ARR IN 3 MONTHS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Lovable transformed AI-driven software development by allowing users
to create apps using natural language prompts. It reached $17M ARR and
30,000 paying customers in just three months. As a no-code interface,
it attracts a wide audience of founders, designers, and marketers. By
leveraging open-source adoption, organic virality, and strategic
integrations, Lovable scaled rapidly with minimal marketing spend,
securing a $15M Series A and becoming the category leader in the
emerging "vibe coding" market.

 YOUR PMM CAREER MATRIX (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Senior PMMs face a key career decision between deepening their
expertise as individual contributors or transitioning into management.
The IC path focuses on mastering positioning, segmentation, and
strategy, while the management track shifts toward hiring, coaching,
and team leadership. Many assume management is just a promotion, but
it requires different skills and trade-offs. Some thrive in
leadership, while others find they miss hands-on product marketing and
later pivot back.

 ZOOM'S ONE-CLICK STRATEGY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 At the start of 2020, Skype had 32.4% of the video conferencing
market, but by 2021, Zoom had captured 48.7%. Zoom's success came from
its focus on simplicity, allowing users to join meetings with a single
click, no account, and no software installation. Its freemium model
and viral growth loop turned every meeting into a product demo,
encouraging more people to host their own calls and upgrade to paid
plans. Deep integrations with calendars and workplace tools further
embedded Zoom into daily workflows, making it the default video
conferencing solution. 

 GOOGLE SEARCH GREW 20%+ IN 2024; RECEIVES ~373X MORE SEARCHES THAN
CHATGPT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Search grew by 21.64% in 2024, reaching over 14 billion
searches per day. Meanwhile, ChatGPT handled only 37.5 million
search-like queries daily. OpenAI's ChatGPT received 1 billion
messages per day, but only 30% had search-like intent. ChatGPT
conversations average 8 messages, meaning many are not direct search
replacements. AI tools like Perplexity, Claude, Copilot, and Gemini
make up less than 2% of total searches. Google remains the dominant
source for information discovery.
