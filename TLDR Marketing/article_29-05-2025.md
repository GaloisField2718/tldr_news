TLDR MARKETING 2025-05-29

 ONLY 4% OF B2B DEMO REQUESTS HAVE UTMS… AND THEY CONVERT WORSE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Default analyzed 51,219 inbound demo requests from 100 B2B software
companies [4]. In a challenge to conventional attribution wisdom, it
turns out only 4.8% of demo requests have UTM parameters.

This validates what many marketers suspect [4] but rarely prove with
data: buyers don't request demos on their first visit. They research,
compare, forget about you, come back through a colleague's Slack link,
and _then_ book a meeting.

NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW DOES GEN Z SHOP? (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 66% of Gen Z are likely to buy directly from TikTok, and 40% are
influenced by trending products on social media. They prefer short,
funny content, with around 69% of Gen Z women and 66% of men favoring
comedy and memes. Influencer marketing is especially effective, with
over half willing to purchase products recommended by influencers,
compared to just 10% of shoppers aged 55 and up. While most of Gen Z
rejects AI influencers, men are more open to them. This group shops
visually, relying on UGC and unboxing videos to validate purchases.
They also research extensively online before buying in-store and often
cross-check information across platforms and peer groups. 

 DIGITAL ADVERTISING IN 2025 IS A PYRAMID SCHEME (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Audiences are increasingly opting out of traditional digital
advertising by blocking or ignoring ads entirely, which reflects
growing dissatisfaction with how brands communicate online. The
overuse of interruptive banners, autoplay videos, and tracking-based
personalization has created experiences that feel invasive and
untrustworthy. To stand out, marketers must rebuild their approach
through content that is more transparent, useful, and
relationship-driven by focusing on owned channels and educational
storytelling rather than depending on algorithms or short-term reach. 

 CONSUMER PESSIMISM EASES AMID COOLING IN US-CHINA TARIFF WAR (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Consumer Confidence Index increased by 12.3 points to 98 in May,
driven partly by easing U.S.-China trade tensions. The share of
consumers expecting a recession declined, and inflation expectations
dropped to 6.5% from 7% in April. Confidence grew across all age,
income, and political groups, with the strongest gains among
Republicans. Despite optimism, economists warned that existing tariffs
may soon push prices higher, and factory orders dropped 6.3% in April
after a surge in March.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IS THE COMPANY BLOG DEAD? (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The era of publishing SEO-optimized blog posts on company websites as
a default playbook is over, with long-form content now needing to
justify its format, channel, and purpose. Marketers are evolving their
GTM content strategies by producing show-like narratives with
recurring themes, stronger editorial direction, and clearer voices
that reflect company expertise. Control over analytics and conversions
still matters, but building influence increasingly depends on
participating in feeds like LinkedIn and Substack while anchoring
high-value resources on a centralized and well-structured owned
domain. 

 PRODUCT DETAIL PAGES (PDP) IN ECOMMERCE: A 2025 GUIDE (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Only 49% of ecommerce sites offer a good user experience on product
detail pages (PDPs), despite nearly all online shoppers relying on
them to make purchase decisions. Optimized PDPs include clear titles,
detailed descriptions, high-quality images or videos, reviews, and
strong calls to action. Best practices also include social proof,
scarcity tactics, mobile optimization, and AI-driven personalization,
which can reduce customer acquisition costs by up to 50% and increase
profits by as much as 30%. Mobile-friendly PDPs are essential, as
mobile now accounts for 57% of ecommerce sales. Avoiding poor media,
lack of product detail, and complicated navigation is critical, as
these issues cause shoppers to abandon purchases.

 KAY-KAY CLAPP ON TYPEFORM'S AUDIENCE-POWERED CONTENT STRATEGY (32
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kay-Kay Clapp, Head of Content and Social at Typeform, recommends
clearly defining one key takeaway for each piece of content to align
stakeholders and simplify creative execution. She uses modular content
systems and structured workflows supported by clear briefs and AI to
streamline production. Audience surveys serve as an effective tool to
directly source relevant content ideas and quotes. SME-driven content
provides unique perspectives that differentiate from generic
AI-generated content. Clapp measures content effectiveness primarily
through owned audience engagement and long-term audience growth,
rather than traditional metrics like traffic or MQLs.
