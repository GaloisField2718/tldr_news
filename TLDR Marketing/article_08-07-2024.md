STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE "BYE NOW" SECRET TO MAKING PEOPLE BUY NOW (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marketing messages can be transformed with homophonic priming ‚Äî the
strategic use of homophones to influence audience thoughts and
actions. By employing phrases like "Write here" (which echoes "right
here") marketers can plant subconscious suggestions that drive
engagement. Incorporating these nuanced wordplays in ads and social
posts can improve dull calls to action. 

 EMAIL MARKETING TIP FOR RETENTION (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In email marketing, focus on what customers click on, not just
whether they click. A single click on a specific link indicates high
intent. Group these high-intent clickers and send tailored messages.
This approach was tested during a BFCM campaign, where an email asking
users to click if they wanted Black Friday notifications generated
more revenue than any other segment. 

 OPTIMIZING FOR AI OVERVIEWS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Optimizing for AI Overviews involves tailoring your content to appear
in AI-generated snippets at the top of search results, focusing on
relevance rather than traditional SEO factors like backlinks. This can
be achieved by ensuring your content is mathematically relevant to
user queries and by using authoritative tones, quotes, and statistics.
While AI Overviews offer enhanced visibility, their volatile nature
and limited current use require a balanced approach in your SEO
strategy.

 CUSTOMER INERTIA: HOW TO BEAT IT AND INCREASE SALES BEYOND
EXPECTATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Customer inertia represents emotions like anxiety or discomfort that
prevent a person from making a purchase. For example, in the 1970s,
people were afraid of loan rejection despite being good candidates, so
The Fidelity Bank ran an ad campaign to assure them of available
funds. Brands can beat customer inertia by understanding customers'
emotions, considering the status quo while positioning, eliminating
the confusion that causes analysis paralysis, and considering
non-buyers in addition to buyers.

decision-making, prevent resource dilution, and ensure focused
efforts.
