 COMMERCE REDEFINED: TIKTOK'S ROLE IN USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF
COMMERCE FOR SHOPPERS AND BUSINESSES (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ipsos, in collaboration with TikTok, explored the new era of commerce
to shed light on how platforms like TikTok are fundamentally altering
the way consumers interact with brands and make purchasing decisions.
3 in 4 shoppers on TikTok agree that the app is the go-to place to
discover new brands and products – replacing the role that
traditional search engines have played. The app's “interest graph”
allows brands to reach audiences that extend beyond their core persona
or target market, opening doors to previously untapped demographics to
drive sales. In fact, TikTok outpaces other core media and e-commerce
platforms when it comes to purchase consideration metrics.

Traditional ad IDs and link-based search are becoming obsolete. He
described the generative AI era as a turning point in history, raising
questions about authorship, energy use, and the future of AI.

CONVERSION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Starting with 5% activation and 1% free-to-paid conversion rates,

showcase examples. In-app banners and contextual upgrade prompts

 A/B TESTING IN 2025: WHY YOUR EMAIL OPENS ARE TANKING (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Email campaigns that leverage AI for subject line testing see a 34%
boost in engagement and multivariate testing improves conversion rates
by 27%. Best practices for email testing include using at least 1,000
subscribers per variant, mobile-friendly subject lines of 41-50
characters, and a minimum 24-hour testing period to ensure statistical
accuracy. Combine behavioral data and cross-channel alignment to
enhance performance and make emails more measurable. 

 INTRODUCING EBAY'S PARTNERSHIP WITH FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 eBay has partnered with Facebook Marketplace to expand the visibility
of select listings in the US, Germany, and France. Sellers don't need
to take any action, as transactions will remain securely managed
through eBay with all protections intact. Buyers redirected from
Facebook Marketplace will complete purchases on eBay, with listings
chosen based on trends and quality. This collaboration aims to connect
sellers with new audiences. 

 FAQ: WHAT TYPES OF THINGS LIMIT MY DISTRIBUTION ON INSTAGRAM (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Instagram advises avoiding third-party watermarks, reposting existing
content, and creating reels over 90 seconds. Shorter videos (30-90
seconds) perform better. Refrain from sharing content that violates
guidelines, discusses sensitive topics like self-harm or violence,
includes explicit material, uses engagement bait, or promotes
regulated products.

 HOW TO ADDRESS THE 95% OF PASSIVE BUYERS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Passive buyers make up 95% of the market and require long-term
strategies focused on building awareness and trust, rather than
immediate conversion tactics. Effective content for this audience
includes easily consumable formats, such as LinkedIn posts and
overview videos, designed to establish credibility gradually over
time. When a buying trigger occurs, businesses that maintain
visibility and relevance are more likely to attract inbound inquiries
or successfully convert leads through outbound efforts. 

 THE ISOLATION EFFECT: WHY “ISOLATED” BRANDS WIN (AND HOW TO
BECOME ONE) (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Financial Times used salmon pink paper in 1893 to stand out from
competitors, significantly boosting its sales and establishing a
memorable brand identity. This success aligns with the "Isolation
Effect," which states that distinct elements are more memorable.
Effective marketing requires brands to break away from market
defaults, embrace bold ideas, and combine differentiation with
distinctiveness. For example, Cadbury's iconic gorilla ad and Dollar
Shave Club's humorous tone helped them stand out and succeed.
Distinctiveness in messaging and visuals is as vital as offering
unique value to capture attention and drive sales. 

 WHY RETAILERS ARE TURNING TO THIRD-PARTY MARKETPLACES (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Traditional retailers such as Walmart and Target are adopting
third-party marketplaces to expand product ranges, monetize traffic,
and collect valuable customer data. This model shifts the retailer's
role from merchant to facilitator, enabling them to offer broader
selections without owning inventory and to generate revenue through
commissions and services like fulfillment and advertising. On the
other hand, challenges such as maintaining customer experience and
coordinating with external sellers require strategic integration with
regular operations.
