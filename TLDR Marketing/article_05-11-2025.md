TLDR MARKETING 2025-11-05

 YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE BUYERS YOU'VE ALREADY WON (SPONSOR) [4]
Marketing teams pour time and budget into acquisition, but FRICTION AT
THE FINAL STEP (unclear pricing, limited payment options, poor
localization, etc.) quietly ERODES CONVERSION YIELD AND ROI. 

A new global research study, _The Friction Report,_ [5] shows how
BOTTOM-FUNNEL INEFFICIENCIES UNDERCUT CONVERSION from paid and organic
traffic, costing GTM teams billions in unrealized revenue. _(From the
report: 82% of software sellers are seeing double-digit cart
abandonment rates.)_

With CAC rising and budgets tightening, IMPROVING CONVERSION
EFFICIENCY IS ONE OF THE FASTEST WAYS TO BOOST PIPELINE PERFORMANCE
WITHOUT INCREASING SPEND.

DOWNLOAD CLEVERBRIDGE'S (UNGATED) REPORT [5] to see how top marketing
teams turn friction into ROI by converting more of the demand they
already earned.

NEWS & TRENDS

 WHAT MARKETERS ARE MISSING AS LOYALTY DRIVERS EVOLVE (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 New research from Razorfish and GWI found that brand loyalty is
driven more by practical factors like convenience and product
performance than by emotional attachment. While 65% of marketers
believe brand love motivates repeat purchases, less than 25% of
consumers agree, and only 5% cite convenience as a core driver. The
report shows consumers value “soft benefits” such as early access
and exclusive events, with 30% desiring limited-edition releases and
28% seeking exclusive content. It also highlights mixed reactions to
AI in marketing, as 37% of consumers say overtly AI-generated content
hurts loyalty while 24% say it improves it. 

 ‘TV' TODAY CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ANYTHING ON A SCREEN THAT FEELS
RELEVANT, AUTHENTIC, AND WORTH AN AUDIENCE'S TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 “TV” now means any video that feels worth watching. This could be
on a phone, social feed, or traditional screen. Social video dominates
viewing, especially for Gen Z and millennials who prefer creator-led
content over high production. Short, serialized micro series built for
vertical viewing are growing fast. As viewers accept more ads,
streaming and social models are blending. Media companies today have
to think beyond broadcast and create content and ads that work across
platforms and creators in a world where “TV” lives everywhere.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY MIXING ONBOARDING PATTERNS DESTROYS ACTIVATION (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Onboarding often fails because too many patterns are used at once.
Each pattern works alone but loses effectiveness when combined, as
they compete for attention and confuse users. Data from multiple
products show that completion rates fall with every added pattern.
Overlapping wizards, tours, checklists, and tooltips create
contradictions and overwhelm users. The best approach is to use a
single, clear onboarding pattern. Simplifying guidance improves
clarity, completion, and trust. If a product needs five onboarding
systems to make sense, the real problem is the product, not the
onboarding. 

 6 BRANDS THAT BRILLIANTLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE COMPETITION (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 These brands illustrate unique paths to market distinction through
product-led innovation, content design, and cultural alignment. Gong
uses internal subject matter experts to build community trust through
LinkedIn and thought leadership events. Better Trail reimagines review
content by layering consumption modes for skimmers, researchers, and
power users, bypassing traditional SEO structures. Liquid Death
disrupts a commodity category by attaching humor, music, and
subculture references to canned water. Each brand demonstrates that
differentiation is successful when product, message, and delivery
align around a single compelling idea that sets it apart from the rest
of the market.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 INSTAGRAM ADDS COMPETITIVE INSIGHTS FOR PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTS (1
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Instagram added a basic benchmarking tool to its Professional
Dashboard that compares post volume and follower growth against up to
10 competitor accounts. It's useful for gauging visibility but omits
core marketing metrics like engagement rates or conversion signals. 

 SCREENSAGE (TOOL) [11] 

 ScreenSage is a macOS screen recording and editing tool that
automates zooming, tracking, captions, and keystroke display for demo
and tutorial creation. It offers 3D effects, AI background removal,
multi-mic recording, privacy masking, and synced Mac-iOS capture. 

 DOES YOUR WEBSITE NEED AN LLMS.TXT FILE? (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LLMs.txt is a proposed new file format designed to guide large
language models toward a website's most valuable content, using a
structured markdown list placed at the root domain. Unlike robots.txt,
which controls crawler access, LLMS.txt serves as a curation tool that
highlights top resources like product pages, help docs, and case
studies for AI citation and interpretation. Adoption remains low, with
no confirmation from major AI platforms that they support it, but
early adopters like Hugging Face and Stripe are using it to
proactively shape how models interpret their content.

 OPTIMIZING FOR THE SURFACELESS WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI systems are reshaping the web into a closed, surfaceless
environment where visibility no longer determines success. Information
now survives through persistence, not attention, as models continually
compress and retrain on what is useful, true, and integral. Content
that clarifies ideas, maintains consistency, and connects meaningfully
across contexts becomes part of the machine's internal understanding
of reality. Marketing must now focus on contributing value that the
system depends on, ensuring continued existence within its evolving
digital ecosystem. 

 IT'S NOT A BRAND. IT'S A LIFESTYLE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brands are blurring the line between luxury and accessibility as
consumers spend less but still want aspirational lifestyles.
Affordable brands like Josh Cellars and Carbone Fine Food are going
premium through collaborations and partnerships, while upscale brands
like American Express and Patrón offer smaller or lower-priced
options to reach younger buyers. Social media has pushed companies to
focus on lifestyle and experience over products, making luxury feel
attainable and turning “affordable aspiration” into the new
marketing sweet spot.
