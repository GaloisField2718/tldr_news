NEWS & TRENDS

 ON TIKTOK, POP CULTURE PREVAILS OVER NEWS AND POLITICS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 While TikTok accounts focused on news and politics comprise less than
1% of those followed by U.S. adults, the platform is emerging as a
news destination. About 50% of followed accounts are influencers and
creators, with only 10% sharing content related to politics and news.
Despite the low percentage of political accounts, 43% of TikTok users
follow accounts discussing politics and current events, and celebrity
endorsements have proven to boost voter registration efforts. 

 INFLUENCERS ARE POSTING LESS FASHION CONTENT THIS YEAR (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 There has been a 14% decrease in fashion content posted by
influencers in 2024 compared to the previous year. This decline
coincides with a significant shift towards video content, with video
views increasing by 28% across regions and a 63% rise in views of
fashion-related videos on Instagram. Influencers may be adapting their
strategies to align with the growing demand for engaging video formats
rather than traditional fashion posts.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL BRAND NAMES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Successful international brand names are under 4 syllables, easy to
pronounce, and free of long consonant or vowel sequences. Avoid
culture-specific meanings and names that need translation. Effective
logos should align with the brand's purpose, especially in Eastern
markets where visuals hold greater significance. Ensure the name lacks
unintended meanings in other languages and prioritize simplicity and
memorability in both name and logo design. 

 DOLLAR A DAY IN ACTION: PROVEN STRATEGIES TO BOOST ENGAGEMENT AND
SALES (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Dollar-a-Day tactic is where brands allocate $1 daily to test ads
on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. The key advantage is
identifying high-performing ads before scaling, making it suitable for
those with limited budgets. It typically takes 2-3 days to gather
enough data to evaluate the ad's performance and adjust for
optimization.

 THE POWER OF PASSIONS: TAPPING INTO CONSUMERS' EMOTIONAL BONDS (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 92% of purchasing decisions are driven by emotion. Three-quarters of
people surveyed across eight markets say engaging in their passions is
a part of their identity. Marketers should focus on segmenting
audiences by their interests (ie. music, food, travel, and sports),
rather than traditional demographics. By leveraging insights from
neuromarketing and understanding consumers' emotional ties, brands can
better resonate with their audiences. 

 AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF RANKING VARIABILITY (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Search result variability increased for non-branded and
location-based keywords after Google's March 2024 Core Update. Certain
industries, like legal services and restaurants, show more regional
competition in search rankings, while national brands like Yelp and
Liberty Mutual see fluctuating performance across states. Localized
SEO strategies, such as using geographic modifiers in meta tags, are
key for both national and regional brands. SEOs must adjust strategies
based on industry, leveraging regional content to rank competitively
in specific locations.
