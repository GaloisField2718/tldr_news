 HOW IMPROVING FIRST IMPRESSIONS INCREASED CONVERSIONS BY 19% (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mobbin, a mobile and web design reference library, had a homepage
that showcased the most recent additions to the library. Its team
found from user testing that recognizable, big-brand assets were
effective at capturing the attention of new visitors, but the logic of
the homepage meant that less attractive assets were often shown. They
tested a version of the page with a ‚Äúsort by‚Äù function, with the
default set to ‚Äúby most popular.‚Äù This resulted in a 19% increase
in transactions and a 48% lift in user engagement with the listings
themselves.

 6 DEADLY MISTAKES GROWTH TEAMS MAKE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Growth teams frequently use improper research methods. They rely on
misleading statistics and focus on the wrong metrics, such as new
signups instead of retention. Growth teams favor short-term growth
hacks over sustainable growth loops, resulting in higher churn.
Misunderstanding user journeys leads to forcing users onto paths they
don't want to take. Inefficiencies also arise from attempting to save
money by building in-house solutions, which often wastes time and
resources.
