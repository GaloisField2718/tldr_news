reduce password and MFA costs and improve account security. Sounds
like an easy win.

NEWS & TRENDS

 IS THE ‚ÄòDEAD INTERNET' THEORY SUDDENLY COMING TRUE? (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The ‚ÄúDead Internet‚Äù theory not only suggests that AI-generated
content is replacing human-created content online, but that this was
purposely orchestrated by governments and corporations to control
public perception. It was once dismissed as a conspiracy, but the
theory has been gaining credibility again as AI advances. AI has been
flooding social media platforms with what's referred to as ‚ÄúAI
slime‚Äù. This influx of AI-generated content poses challenges for
users and advertisers, who may struggle to discern authenticity and
engagement.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE MISTAKES TO YOUR ADVANTAGE IN YOUR COPYWRITING (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 This article walks through 2 effective marketing examples that
utilize honest communication about mistakes. Doing so can humanize a
brand and build trust. One tactic involves highlighting a known
downside along with the features that really matter ‚Äì such as an
awful-tasting cough syrup that actually works. The other is to show
all reviews on a website rather than hiding the bad ones, which makes
positive sentiments appear more legitimate. 

 EMAIL MARKETING TIP: SEND A PERSONAL LETTER FROM THE FOUNDER (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Adding a personal letter from the founder in your welcome and
checkout abandonment flows can be highly effective in converting
hesitant potential buyers. The email should encourage prospects to ask
questions by replying to the email, provide an upgraded incentive,
instill urgency, and be written in plain text. The tone of voice
should be conversational and not too formal. This is meant to spark
the reader's interest and add a personal touch to the entire email
flow.

 NOT JUST CHATGPT: AI WORKFLOWS & TOOLS FOR MARKETERS (11 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A recent survey of marketers found that most are only seeing minor

article walks through 5 AI workflows beyond generating written content

presentations in way less time, produce personalized assets for your
account-based marketing, and create high-converting web content. 

 GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE: BEWARE OF MISSING CLICKS (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When you apply any filter in Google Search Console, the platform
typically hides a large percentage of clicks for 'privacy' which are
consequently not included in the totals. This can make SEO performance
look worse than it actually is if you're only looking at raw totals.
You can use filtered data to get an idea for a trend (e.g. "branded
clicks are going up/down") but Google won't give you the precise data.
