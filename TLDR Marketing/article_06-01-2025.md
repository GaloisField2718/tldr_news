NEWS & TRENDS

 'BIGGEST INFLUENCER SCAM OF ALL TIME'?: PAYPAL ACCUSED OF POACHING
COMMISSIONS VIA ITS 'HONEY' BROWSER EXTENSION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PayPal is facing a class action that accuses its Honey browser
extension of replacing affiliate links from influencers with Honey
links, diverting commissions. The lawsuit claims that Honey
intentionally interfered with contracts and seeks over $5M in damages.
Influencers argue that Honey's last-click attribution unfairly
redirects revenue, harming the creator economy. The case could lead to
greater regulatory scrutiny on practices that impact content creators'
income from advertising, sponsorships, and affiliate deals. 

 THE STATE OF WEBSITE PRIVACY: HERE'S WHAT THE NUMBERS SAY (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 75% of the most visited websites in the US and Europe are
noncompliant with major privacy regulations like the CPRA and GDPR. In
the US, top websites share personal data with an average of 17
third-party advertisers. In Europe, 6.79% of media and ecommerce sites
fail to meet privacy standards. Since 2022, at least 10 US companies
have been fined for noncompliance, and Amazon was fined $888 million
in Europe for improper targeting.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO "HOOK" IN EXACTLY 3 SECONDS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "3-second rule" for marketing video ads says that you should
address the audience within the first 3 seconds by mentioning their
job title, problem, or group. This tactic taps into the brain's focus
on identity-related information, boosting engagement. Companies like
Deel, Gong, and Hubspot use it to target roles like HR Managers, Sales
VPs, and Marketers. It works well on broad-reach channels like YouTube
or TV, where audience targeting is less precise. 

 BRANDS TO WATCH ON THREADS (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Brand engagement on Threads is thriving because the platform allows
social media managers to post relatable, spontaneous content without
heavy oversight or approvals. Brands like TSA, USPS, Beyond Meat,
Calm, and Notion are thriving by embracing this freedom, posting at
all hours with casual, unfiltered updates.

 ECOMMERCE SMBS NEED FACELESS VIDEOS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Faceless videos use voice overs, animations, and images to promote
products or share information. They're cost-effective as they require
less expertise and can be easily produced with AI tools. Tools like
Animoto, Jasper, Copy.ai, Grok, ElevenLabs, and Murf.ai help
streamline idea generation, scripting, visuals, voiceovers, and
editing.

 HOW BIRKENSTOCK REINVENTED ITS BRAND TO MEET MODERN DEMANDS (8 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Birkenstock's 2023 sales rose by 20% following a rebranding that
segmented audiences into 4 core groups: comfort seekers, independents,
acceptance seekers, and balancers. The brand revamped its
architecture, phased out underperforming sub-brands, and emphasized
its core value of “genuine spirit” with a focus on craftsmanship
and originality. The overhaul also included modernized retail
experiences, edgier visual merchandising, and immersive pop-up events.


 SOARING DEMAND FOR WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS COULD CHANGE FOOD SPENDING (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Households with GLP-1 drug users, like Ozempic, reduced grocery
spending by 6% within 6 months. Spending at fast-food restaurants also
declined, particularly at breakfast and dinner. The average household
spends $416 less annually, with reductions in high-calorie, high-sugar
foods. In response, chains like Smoothie King have adapted by creating
GLP-1 Support Menus. GLP-1 usage, which has surged 32% since June, is
reshaping consumer dining habits and food spending.
