 6 OUTDATED AI MARKETING TRENDS YOU SHOULD RETIRE IN 2025 (6 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Outdated tactics like basic chatbots, limited sentiment analysis, and
historical-data-only predictive analytics no longer meet the demand
for real-time, personalized interactions. AI now enables context-aware
recommendations that anticipate user intent, while voice search
optimization has shifted toward functional voice commerce. Instead of
basic demographic segmentation, advanced AI-driven micro-segmentation
now provides real-time audience targeting across multiple channels.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THEY BUILT A $100K/MO BUSINESS WITH LINKEDIN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 FletchPMM reached $100K/month by focusing on one target audience, a
single service, and using LinkedIn as its primary marketing channel.
Its streamlined offer addresses complex B2B messaging needs through
workshops and wireframes. By consistently sharing expert content and
messaging frameworks, it established itself as a specialist in B2B
messaging, building brand recognition, and generating leads. Its
visually distinct posts, paired with a 5-step content funnel, keep it
top of mind for potential clients. 

 HOW I CREATE CONTENT THAT ATTRACTS CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To create content that sells, develop mini-guides based on your
expertise and share your offer weekly. Engage with peers by compiling
a list of 10 rising stars (5K-20K followers), as they likely have your
ideal ICP on their radar. Optimize readability by varying line
lengths, using bullet points and one-line sentences, and ensuring the
text is visually appealing. This post provides examples of how to
apply the PAIS (Pain, Agitation, Ideal situation, Solution) and Future
Pacing frameworks to content.
