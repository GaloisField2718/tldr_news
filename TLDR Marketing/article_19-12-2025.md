NEWS & TRENDS

 2026 MUSIC MARKETING TRENDS: WORLD-BUILDING, MYSTERY CAMPAIGNS, IRL
ACTIVATIONS, AND MORE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Music campaigns in 2026 leaned into storytelling and experiential
design. Mystery-based launches turn speculation into participation,
creating momentum through secrecy and community clues. Single releases
now carry full narrative arcs, using props, locations, and symbols to
shape fan perception. Real-life touchpoints drive digital traction,
especially when surprising or deeply personal. Revisiting past hits,
visuals, or venues taps into nostalgia to boost shareability and
reintroduce legacy acts to younger audiences. Cinematic formats unify
content across touchpoints, making each release feel like an unfolding
story with chapters, characters, and set pieces fans can return to and
share. 

 CRITEO STUDY: HOW TO MAXIMIZE RETAIL MEDIA IMPACT BEYOND ROAS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Criteo's research found that retail media delivers value beyond ROAS
by driving discovery, conversion, and incremental growth that
last-click metrics miss. Full funnel measurement matters because paid
exposure increases organic demand and purchase intent, as shown by
conversion rates that are about 2x higher for shoppers who click
sponsored ads and organic search clicks rising by over 50% in the
Americas. Performance improves when investment and tactics scale
together, since combining display and sponsored product ads lifts
revenue per user by 3.2x, and increasing spend by more than 10%
correlates with positive year-over-year organic sales growth.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR NEXT LAUNCH WILL FAIL WITHOUT AN AMPLIFIER STRATEGY (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Launching without an amplifier plan makes marketing an afterthought.
Product and marketing must be built together. Design for amplifiers
before buyers. These include journalists, reviewers, creators,
influencers, analysts, and trusted communities. Give them reasons to
talk by baking hooks into the product, story, and data. Distribution
now comes from people, not posts. 

 HOW I GOT $120K + 12K NEW FOLLOWERS ON LINKEDIN IN 4 MONTHS (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A LinkedIn account went from 0 inbound leads to 10+ per week by
overhauling its content strategy. Posting 5X a week, rewriting the
profile multiple times, and sharing professional wins, failures, and
growth stories built authority. The 3Ps strategy guided content, with
Perspective posts offering insights, Proof posts showing results, and
Promo posts generating leads. Each post addressed client pain points
in actionable micro-lessons, while outreach and consultative calls
focused on listening and adding value. Storytelling and vulnerability
turned every interaction into a data point.

 HOW TO BUILD A BRAND SUBREDDIT: FULL SETUP GUIDE (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Only brands with an active Reddit audience, strong moderation, and
comfort with criticism should start a subreddit. If not, alternatives
like joining existing subreddits or using user accounts work better.
For those who qualify, define your goal, such as support, advocacy, or
awareness. Then, assign a moderator, build rules, and post
conversation starters. Launch quietly with core users before scaling.
Keep it active with daily check-ins, recurring threads, and
transparent replies to complaints. Over time, a subreddit boosts
credibility, surfaces user insights, and strengthens brand visibility
across platforms and search engines.

 STATE OF CONSUMER AI 2025: PRODUCT HITS, MISSES, AND WHAT'S NEXT (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Consumer AI is trending toward a winner-take-most dynamic, with usage
and spend highly concentrated around a single assistant for most
users. ChatGPT leads with an estimated 800 to 900M WAUs, a 36% DAU to
MAU ratio, and 50% month 12 desktop retention, while Gemini trails in
scale but is growing faster at 155% YoY desktop user growth and nearly
300% YoY growth in paid subscriptions. New standalone products have
mixed results, as Sora reached 12M downloads but under 8% day 30
retention, while NotebookLM doubled web users YoY and reached 8M MAUs
on mobile. The biggest opportunity ahead sits outside the major labs,
as focused startups continue to reach millions of users by building
dedicated consumer experiences rather than general assistants. 

 COCA-COLA CHRISTMAS AD CONTROVERSY: CAN AI REPLACE HUMAN CREATIVITY
IN MARKETING? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Coca-Cola's use of AI in its Christmas ads shows how efficiency gains
can clash with emotional authenticity in brand storytelling. In
November 2024, it recreated the iconic Holidays Are Coming ad using
AI, which was faster and cheaper but triggered backlash as viewers
called it soulless, even though impressions were high. In 2025, it
released another AI holiday ad using animals and archival Santa
imagery, signaling it would continue despite criticism. The move
suggests it is testing how much emotional distance consumers will
tolerate, especially during Christmas, while relying on deep brand
loyalty to limit real sales impact.
