 6 LINKEDIN HACKS TO GROW YOUR AUDIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Engage authentically with 5-10 thought leaders, especially within the
first hour of their posts. Use original graphics, like data and
marked-up screenshots, to capture attention. You don't always need
links - native graphics suffice. Post consistently, ideally 2-3 times
a week. Share counterintuitive perspectives that stand out. Repurpose
top-performing content every 6-12 months to refresh your reach.

with each stage of the customer journey. TOFU strategies like webinars
and quizzes generate leads, MOFU tactics like comparison pages and

metrics like bounce rates, and apply conversion-centered design
principles to remove unnecessary links and drive clear actions.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 5 THINGS YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT PMAX (THAT MOST PEOPLE STILL DON'T) (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Performance Max (pMax) campaigns have 5 key aspects that are often
overlooked. Negative keyword lists can exclude unwanted traffic,
including brand traffic. Audience signals guide Google's algorithm but
don't directly target users. Search themes in pMax can cannibalize
traffic from Search campaigns, affecting performance. pMax may inflate
results by taking credit for branded conversions, which can be
excluded for accurate measurement. Scripts can be used to help
understand spend allocation across channels and optimize campaign
performance. 

 WHY FAQS SHOULD BE YOUR GO-TO MARKETING TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FAQs ensure alignment in internal and external communications,
especially during mergers, crises, product launches, or rebranding.
They address audience-specific questions while maintaining
confidentiality. Effective FAQs require input from subject-matter
experts, who help refine messaging, anticipate audience needs, and
support content creation, such as press releases and SEO-optimized
materials.
