NEWS & TRENDS

 HOW INFLUENCER MARKETING LOST ITS EDGE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Influencer marketing remains valuable but is showing signs of decline
due to oversaturation and growing consumer skepticism. Tools like
SponsorBlock and negative reactions to hashtags like “#ad” show
users are actively avoiding influencer content. Trust has eroded
further due to controversies like Honey and BetterHelp, with only 12%
of people likely to buy influencer-promoted products and 42% of those
regretting it. 

 48% OF CREATIVES IDENTIFY AS NEURODIVERGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Almost half of creative industry professionals identify as
neurodivergent. Yet 1 in 3 are dissatisfied with their roles and many
face bias. About 90% report masking and 50% say stigma prevents them
from disclosing their neurodivergence at work. Most creatives feel
held back by a system that favors speed and real-time output over
deep, divergent thinking. Although only 18% of neurodivergent
employees request accommodations, nearly 80% of those who do are
satisfied with the results.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OPENAI USED A 50-YEAR-OLD PRICING METHOD TO NAIL CHATGPT PRO'S
$20/MONTH PRICE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI used the Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Model to set ChatGPT
Pro's $20 monthly price. The model relies on four survey questions
that ask when a product is too expensive, too cheap, getting
expensive, and a bargain. By plotting the responses, OpenAI identified
where perceptions of value and cost overlapped, revealing the optimal
price range based on real user feedback rather than internal
guesswork. 

 HOW SENJA CRACKED VIRAL PRODUCT-LED GROWTH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Senja is a testimonial tool that grew to $70K in monthly revenue
within 3 years by focusing on simplicity, speed, and user experience.
It delivers value in under 5 minutes with a frictionless process that
makes users feel like marketers through a smart freemium model. Its
"powered by Senja" badges generate tens of thousands of monthly
impressions, turning free users into brand ambassadors. The platform
relies on user behavior data instead of assumptions, proving that
great products can scale without ads or sales teams. 

 LOCALIZATION SEO THAT WORKS: 10 REAL-WORLD LESSONS FROM 14 MARKETS (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ahrefs quadrupled traffic to its Spanish blog in 18 months by
localizing content rather than just translating it, growing from 5.4K
to over 22K visits. It used culturally relevant language variants like
Brazilian Portuguese and local keyword research instead of direct
translation. Market prioritization was based on billing data, search
trends, and tech adoption, targeting countries such as Indonesia and
Japan. Content was created or adapted to fit local norms and voice,
building trust and attracting backlinks. Ahrefs also maintained
consistent terminology, used AI for bulk tasks with human review, and
kept strong technical SEO to support localization.

 OAT MILK MEETS MEXICO CITY: OATLY'S TROUBLING (BUT SUCCESSFUL)
MEXICAN MARKETING CAMPAIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Oatly's campaign in Mexico City sparked backlash for using English
ads in a Spanish-speaking country. The brand focused on gentrified
neighborhoods like Roma Norte and Condesa, where expats and affluent
locals live. Critics called out the lack of cultural adaptation and
the health concerns of its product. Yet the campaign worked. Oatly
partnered with trendy cafes, ran pop-ups, and referenced local sounds
like “Se compran colchones”. 

 SUBSTACK IS THE BEST PLACE ON THE INTERNET – LET'S HOPE THE BRANDS
DON'T RUIN IT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Substack has avoided the typical decline of social platforms by
rejecting ads and focusing on direct creator-reader relationships. It
earns revenue by taking a cut of subscription fees, with over 50
creators making more than $1M annually. While its growth and recent
brand involvement, including American Eagle and Hinge campaigns, raise
questions about preserving its original appeal, creative brand use
that fits the platform's style could benefit both creators and
advertisers. The challenge will be maintaining Substack's special,
ad-free experience as it evolves. 

 “A DECISION WAS MADE HERE”: OREO FINDS GENIUS IN THE AISLE (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This Oreo ad highlights a common shopping behavior where someone
grabs a product, changes their mind, and leaves it above a pack of
Oreos. Instead of hiding this messy reality, Oreo embraced it with raw
visuals and the simple phrase, “A decision was made here”. Without
actors, slogans, or polish, the campaign uses observational humor to
reveal true brand preference. This is an example of behavioral
marketing that trusts the audience's intelligence and shows that
sometimes the quietest message is the most powerful.
