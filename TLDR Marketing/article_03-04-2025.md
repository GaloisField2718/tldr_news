TIKTOK (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The US government is exploring a new corporate structure for TikTok
to address national security concerns as the April 5 deadline
approaches. Various companies are exploring bids with different
strategic angles. Amazon wants to pair TikTok's engagement with its

past cloud deals. Financial players like Blackstone offer

 TRUMP TARIFFS TIMING COULDN'T BE WORSE FOR HOLLYWOOD (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Trump's newly announced tariffs come at a critical time for
Hollywood, as studios enter upfront negotiations amid high ad market
uncertainty. Major advertiser categories, such as automotive, CPG, and
travel are reassessing budgets due to trade-related cost pressures.
While sports remains a bright spot with sustained demand, traditional
entertainment is likely to face tighter, more selective spending in
both linear and streaming channels. 

 BIG PLATFORMS ARE EMBRACING GAMING, BUT AD SPEND STILL LAGS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Gaming accounts for 23% share of screen time among Gen Z, but still
captures less than 3% of US digital ad spend. The disconnect is caused
mostly by buying complexity and fragmented inventory which are being
addressed by recent innovations. As platforms like Roblox and Samsung
introduce scalable, programmatic-friendly formats such as rewarded
video ads and gamified ad breaks, gaming ads have a better chance to
become a more integrated part of mainstream media strategies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY BUYERS ARE BECOMING IMMUNE TO “PUSH” MARKETING (AND HOW TO DO
IT RIGHT) (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Push marketing interrupts potential buyers, but overuse makes people
immune to it. Pull marketing, meanwhile, makes buyers come to you by
offering them content they might be interested in. To keep push
tactics effective, make them distinct and personalized, like GumGum's
comic book campaign that won T-Mobile as a client. For high-value B2B
offers, pushing for immediate conversions is inefficient since only 5%
of businesses are actively buying at any moment. Instead, push tactics
should focus on building relationships, providing value, and keeping
brands top of mind for when buyers are ready to purchase. 

 5 STRATEGIES FOR ENGAGING AUDIENCES WITH LINKEDIN LIVE EVENT
STREAMING (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Live videos generate 7X more reactions and 24X more comments than
regular videos on LinkedIn, making them a powerful tool for
engagement. Focus on formats like product launches, panel discussions,
and Q&As while keeping broadcasts under two hours. Make it easy for
attendees to discover events, receive reminders, and access recordings
afterward. Keep engagement high with interactive elements, teasers,
and pre-recorded content. Structure event phases around a single
objective at a time, whether it's awareness, engagement, or lead gen.

 HOW AI IS ALREADY CHANGING MARKETING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Fashion brands are increasingly integrating AI into marketing and
creative operations, from backend automation to AI-led product
discovery, which is boosting efficiency and revenue. AI-generated
content, such as digital twin models and automated copywriting, is
controversial but has been widely adopted - 79% of marketing teams
plan to expand AI use in 2025. While AI can streamline workflows and
enhance insights, concerns over job automation and creative IP remain.
Companies must balance AI's benefits with consumer trust, using it to
support human creativity rather than replace it.

 HOW MINDSHARE MARKETING BUILDS TRUST BEFORE THE BUY (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Mindshare marketing helps brands become the first name buyers think
of by showing up consistently in the right conversations. The approach
focuses on earning trust and mental real estate with the target
audience long before they enter a buying cycle. Key tactics include
sharing authentic and useful content, engaging in peer-led
communities, and establishing authority through helpful insights. This
strategy can drive sustained growth for brands playing the long game,
but it is hard to attribute and measure.
