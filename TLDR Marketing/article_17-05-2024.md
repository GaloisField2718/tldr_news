TIMES (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Small businesses worldwide are grappling with a crisis of confidence
in their marketing efforts, with only a quarter feeling assured about
the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. This lack of
certainty has spurred SMBs to take proactive measures, such as

relentless demands of running a business often leave little time for
marketing endeavors, relegating such tasks to the bottom of the list.

 HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR VIDEOS TO REACH MORE OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Videos tend to underperform for businesses because they lack a clear
plan or effective video marketing strategy. Instead of just focusing
on view counts, come up with goals based on what you want your
audience to do after watching your videos. To hook viewers, lead with
a strong, benefit-driven headline or opening statement that
immediately communicates the value proposition of your video. Retain
viewers by making the content relevant to the platform and funnel
stage of the viewer. Use visual cues in-video and the surrounding
elements to reinforce your call-to-action. 

 GOOGLE'S AI OVERVIEWS (SGE) IS LIVE - HERE'S WHAT TO EXPECT (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google's AI Overviews are an attempt to take unstructured data
gathered from web content and give a structured answer to a search
query, just like answer boxes. Its impact on SEO results will vary
widely across industries and categories. For informational content and
top-of-funnel keywords, the clickthrough rate will likely decline by
over 50%. However, there could be very little traffic loss on topics
with deep content or products/service pages that can't easily be
summarized.
