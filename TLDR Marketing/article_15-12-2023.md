 PINTEREST IS HAVING A MOMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gen Zers make up over 40% of Pinterest‚Äôs active monthly users.
They‚Äôre outpacing millennials who first discovered and popularized
the platform. Pinterest is growing because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúplace of
solace,‚Äù instead of one of comparing and competing. Gen Zers are

they want to travel, and people they want to date. They‚Äôre ditching
Google and browsing on social platforms instead.

growth strategies. Implementing reverse trials in a freemium model can
increase conversion rates since it gets users hooked on paid features.
Ensuring lower-tier customers have clear visibility into the features
of higher-tier plans is critical. Finally, improving high load times
on critical pages increases the number of users that convert.
