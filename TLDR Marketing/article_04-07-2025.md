 AMAZON CONVERSIONS RISE 2.2X WHEN SELLERS LOOK BEYOND AGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Combining generational targeting with audience values and behaviors
boosts Amazon conversions by up to 2.2X compared to age alone. Page
views, add-to-cart, and purchase rates also increase by about 1.5X.
Many consumers identify more with mindsets or communities than their
birth generation. Almost 60% say brands make inaccurate assumptions
based on age. People are 2.2X more unified by shared communities, 2.1X
by behaviors, and 1.4X by values than by generation. Nissan UK and
Booking.com saw strong results by targeting shared passions and
inclusivity beyond age groups. 

 RESEARCH: MARKETING TECH IS BROKEN. HERE'S HOW TO FIX IT (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Companies are dedicating 24% of their marketing budgets to martech,
but 44% of tools go unused, and nearly half of marketers say outcomes
fall short of expectations. Higher impact is linked to strategic
motivations, broader organizational integration, and involving
marketing leadership, which boosts martech impact by 25%. Use of genAI
also improves performance, with top users employing it in 32.1% of
marketing activities compared to 4.3% among low users. To improve
outcomes, companies should audit martech regularly, invest in talent,
focus on long-term metrics, and align tools with creativity and
customer insights.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 10 STORYTELLING TIPS FROM 10 YEARS AT DISNEY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Drawing from a decade at Pixar and Disney, Jonathan Hurwitz explains
how strong stories rely on wants versus needs, emotional themes like
loss or sacrifice, and visual cues like shapes and colors to drive
meaning quickly. He applies these lessons to social strategies that
include casting real individuals, building brand “vibes,” and
using narrative closure to create lasting impact. 

 COMPLAINTS: WHEN TO USE EMPATHY VS EXPLANATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To reduce the virality of online complaints, brands should respond
with empathy to disappointed customers and use explanations for angry
ones. A study of over 470,000 Facebook posts showed that this strategy
can cut complaint virality by up to 11 percent. Explanations help calm
angry customers, while empathy works better for those feeling sad or
let down. Brands that alternate these response styles in ongoing
interactions see higher engagement and better public perception. 

 THE POWER OF LONG-FORM CONTENT: WHY IT'S STILL RELEVANT IN SEO (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Studies show that articles with 1,500 words or more tend to perform
better on search engine results pages compared to shorter posts. This
format allows marketers to cover topics more thoroughly, which aligns
with user intent and improves dwell time as readers stay longer to
consume detailed content. The combination of depth and relevance helps
generate more backlinks, which in turn boosts authority and sustains
long-term traffic.

 MY FAVORITE ACCOUNT IS A LIBRARY IN OHIO (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Columbus Metropolitan Library's social media focuses on content
creation through a staff “Writer's Room” where ideas are pitched
and developed. Posts prioritize humor, storytelling, and
community-centric themes, often spotlighting staff and patrons.
Content is produced with a slow, intentional pace, prioritizing
quality over frequency. Videos are scripted, filmed across branches,
and edited professionally. The library avoids chasing trends unless a
natural fit arises. The platforms act as a digital extension of the
library, allowing people to connect when they can't visit in person.
