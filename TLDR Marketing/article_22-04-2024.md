 ANCHORING BEYOND PRICING: HOW TO INCREASE YOUR BRAND'S PERCEIVED
VALUE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The anchoring effect is when people depend too much on the first

brand, exploited this principle by advertising ‚Äú2 months' salary‚Äù
as the appropriate price for a diamond ring, which provided an anchor
to consumers who didn't know how much to pay for a diamond. Anchors
can also be used to clarify positioning, such as ‚ÄúNetflix for
books‚Äù. The category you market your brand in can also make a
difference in how consumers perceive its value.
