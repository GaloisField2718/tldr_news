audience compared to other platforms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I GET CUSTOMERS TO OPEN UP (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers often overcomplicate customer interviews. In reality,
only two types of questions matter: good questions, which provide
honest, insightful feedback, and bad questions, which yield vague,
biased answers. Good questions focus on past behaviors and real
experiences, such as asking how customers have solved specific
problems rather than hypothetical future actions. This approach cuts
through superficial responses. 

 PRICING STRATEGIES WHEN YOUR AUDIENCE IS SMALL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Small audiences don't have to limit revenue, with pricing strategies
like offering consulting services and treating advice as a sellable
content product being key. Calculating a realistic "survival rate" and
setting prices based on effectiveness can help business owners make
more money in less time. Building a business funnel that turns
audience members into paying customers ensures that even small
audiences can generate consistent revenue.

engaging with other posts, and premium options like custom CTA

engage more effectively. Other new tools like LinkedIn newsletters
have shown rapid audience growth potential, with some pages gaining
thousands of subscribers within weeks.

by allowing fans to promote videos from channels with fewer than
500,000 subscribers. Fans can hype videos within the first 7 days of
release, earning creators points that boost their position on a weekly
leaderboard, potentially introducing them to a wider audience. Hype

 ATTENTION IS ADVERTISING'S CURRENCY, LET'S AGREE ON ITS VALUE (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Attention is key to measuring ad effectiveness, but a standardized
definition is still missing. Advances in technology like AI and
eye-tracking enable more accurate attention measurement, but the
industry needs consensus on metrics across platforms. This author
calls for collaboration among brands, agencies, and platforms to
create consistent standards. 

 REDDIT THREADS ARE BLOWING UP ON TIKTOK AND INSTAGRAM (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Reddit threads are gaining massive visibility on TikTok, YouTube,
Instagram, and X through reposted content like screenshots, story
narrations, and reaction videos. TikTok's popular format of pairing
narrated Reddit stories with gameplay and YouTube creators reacting to
controversial posts like “Am I The Asshole?” have helped drive
Reddit's presence off-platform. However, while this cross-platform
content increases awareness, it hasn't translated into significant
traffic back to Reddit itself. The trend shows Reddit's growing
mainstream influence, though much of the engagement remains on other
social platforms. 

 PHOTOS STILL MATTER ON BRAND SOCIAL (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Great photography continues to be key to creating memorable brand
campaigns, despite the increasing focus on video, with trends on
social media often leading to visual homogenization. Micro trends,
like bows and jaguar print, come and go quickly, while macro trends,
such as film-inspired aesthetics, evolve more slowly. Social media
tends to prolong trends, as platforms incentivize the use of proven
visuals for engagement.
