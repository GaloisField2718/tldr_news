 PINTEREST MEN'S TREND REPORT: HOW MEN ARE REDEFINING MASCULINITY
THROUGH STYLE, SUBSTANCE, AND SELF-CARE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Men on Pinterest focus on wellbeing, style, tech, and family. Over
one-third of Pinterest's global users are men, with Pilates searches
up to 300% and rock climbing aesthetics growing by 95%. Half of Gen Z
and Millennial men care about appearance and self-care, with male
makeup searches up 50% and beard styles rising 205%. Tech interest is
high, shown by 1,210% growth in 3D printer design searches and 620%
growth in investment app searches. Parenthood is also trending, with
milestone picture searches increasing 415%. 

 WHAT QUERY FAN-OUT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE OF SEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Google's query fan-out technique breaks a single search into many
related subqueries, pulling data from across the web to deliver one
comprehensive AI-powered answer. This collapses the traditional
multi-step search process into a single response, significantly
reducing traffic opportunities for publishers. AI Mode may threaten
publisher visibility and ad revenue by eliminating the need to click
through multiple search results. To adapt, content creators must focus
on unique, structured, high-quality content, strengthen off-site
visibility, and deepen direct relationships with their audience.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LINKEDIN INFLUENCER MARKETING: UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Influencer marketing is projected to surpass $10 billion in U.S.
investment this year, and LinkedIn has become a strong contender for
both B2B and B2C campaigns due to its focus on credibility and
professional audiences. LinkedIn's updates, including vertical video
and ad revenue sharing, have boosted video consumption by 36% year
over year. One company's LinkedIn influencer campaigns in 2024
generated over 4 million impressions, 100,000 engagements, and 500
leads through 125 content pieces. Brands like Lyft and Sweet Loren's
have shown that LinkedIn can also drive impact for consumer-facing
products by sparking authentic conversations and creative engagement. 

 4 TIPS TO CREATING A SCALABLE AI PROCESS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Don't rely on chat-based workflows with AI tools for every task.
Instead, create detailed, structured prompts with clear variables to
ensure repeatable results. Test and refine these prompts, break
complex tasks into smaller steps, and integrate them into automations
like custom GPTs or Zapier workflows. Use reusable, well-crafted
prompts to scale AI beyond one-off conversations.

PostcardMania, built a $100 million business using direct mail and
emphasizes making print pieces modern through tools like QR codes, CRM
integration, and personalized targeting. She warns against falling
into spammy habits and stresses that clarity in headlines and
eye-catching CTAs are key to effective mailers.

 BEWARE OF THE GOOGLE AI SALESMAN AND ITS CRONIES (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Google's AI Overviews prioritize sponsored content and ads. It often
pushes biased or fake product recommendations sourced mostly from
manufacturers and sponsored reviews. This focus on advertising revenue
harms independent websites, whose search traffic declines while Reddit
threads filled with affiliate spam surge. Users should fact-check AI
answers and log out of Google accounts for clearer results. 

 WHY AGENCIES OFFER MORE STRATEGY THAN THEY USED TO (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Creative agencies have evolved into transformation partners focused
on driving business value. Design alone is no longer enough to help
brands stand out. As branding became more accessible, businesses
turned to agencies for help with deeper challenges like growth,
loyalty, and product strategy. In response, agencies expanded into
strategic services, competing with consultancies by offering faster,
more creative, and often more affordable solutions. 

 PIM SOFTWARE IS NOW A GROWTH TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Product information management (PIM) software helps businesses manage
product data across multiple channels and is essential for those with
thousands of SKUs. It enables growth by supporting strategies like SKU
expansion, higher conversion rates, and selling more profitable items.
Modern PIMs use AI to create personalized product personas and adapt
descriptions, images, and translations for different platforms and
audiences. While integration is complex and best suited for larger
businesses, AI has made PIM a powerful growth tool by automating tasks
like translation, data cleansing, and content generation.
