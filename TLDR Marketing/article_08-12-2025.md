 WARNER BROS DISASTER? NETFLIX INKS DEAL FOR TROUBLED HOLLYWOOD GIANT
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix will likely consolidate streaming inventory across HBO Max
and its own ad-supported tier, expanding its footprint in premium ad
formats. This move will create a new scaled challenger to Disney and
Amazon for high-value video ad budgets. It also raises the bar for
branded content partnerships, audience targeting, and global reach in
connected TV. 

 WORKING FROM HOME IS HARMING YOUNG EMPLOYEES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Remote work can hinder younger employees' career growth by limiting
training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities. Many report
missing informal learning and struggling to build visibility with
managers. In-person proximity improves skill development, while remote
work slows career progress and increases unemployment among recent
graduates. As a result, younger workers are spending more time in
offices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 3-STEP FRAMEWORK FOR ACCOUNT-FOCUSED WEBINARS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Focus webinars on a small set of target accounts and build the
session specifically for them. Drive attendance with a structured
sequence by calling top accounts 3 weeks out, involving a customer
co-presenter 2 weeks out, sending the deck 1 week out, and texting key
registrants the day before. Use a concise 30-minute format that shares
learning, customer results, implementation, and Q&A. Then follow up
within 2 hours with recordings, templates, and personalized sessions
for target accounts. 

 WINNING BACK CUSTOMERS REQUIRES FIXING WHAT DROVE THEM AWAY (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Winning back customers or employees is more effective than acquiring
new ones. However, it requires admitting mistakes and proving real
change. People leave when gaps form between expectations and
experience. Most win-back attempts fail because they rely on generic
messages, discounts, or incentives without addressing the root cause.
Effective win-backs start by diagnosing why someone left, fixing the
issue, owning the mistake, and showing concrete proof of improvement.
Outreach should be personalized, returning must feel like an upgrade,
rejoining should be easy, and reinforcement after the return is
essential.

 GEMINI TIP: SELECT MULTIPLE CHROME TABS TO QUERY (1 MINUTE READ) [10]


 The Google Chrome integration in Gemini allows you to select multiple
browser tabs to query. This can be used to analyze multiple
top-performing pages in search, analyze pages of YouTube comments, and
more. 

 OPENAI SAYS IT'S TURNED OFF APP SUGGESTIONS THAT LOOK LIKE ADS (1
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI paused app suggestions in ChatGPT after users reported that
they appeared as ads. These were unpaid recommendations for platform
apps, but the execution created confusion. Future brand placements in
AI tools will require clear separation from promotional content and
stronger user controls. 

 PRODUCT MARKETING PRIORITIZATION: A FIELD GUIDE FOR DOING LESS, BUT
BETTER (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Most PMM teams struggle to prioritize because they lack a clear
strategy. A solid strategy stays simple, actionable, and flexible.
This guide shows PMMs how to set goals, define their role, cut
low-value work, and use an Action and Priority Matrix to rank tasks by
impact and effort so they focus on quick wins.

 MARKETING MISTAKES MADE BY GOOGLE+ (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google+ failed because millions of sign-ups did not turn into real
use, and 90% of sessions lasted less than 5 seconds. The platform
never built emotional pull or a clear identity, and users spent only
about 3 minutes/month on it despite more than 200M registered
accounts. Over-integration into products like YouTube and Gmail caused
friction instead of adoption, and two data leaks that exposed millions
of profiles damaged trust. Without creator activity or a core action
that kept users returning, the platform could not build habits and
ultimately shut down. 

 NEW RESEARCH: WHAT WE LEARNED FROM ANALYZING 60K+ GOOGLE FAN-OUT
QUERIES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google uses an average of 9.06 fan-out queries per prompt, and 59% of
prompts trigger between 5 and 11 queries. Software prompts generate
the most fan-outs at 11.7, while Local prompts generate the fewest at
3.79. Fan-out queries average 6.7 words, and 77% fall in the 5 to 8
word range. The most common Ngrams include 2024 or 2025 at 6.26% and
reviews at 2.14%, which shows that fresh content, comparison content,
and review content are major drivers of what Google chooses to
surface.
