 A DANCE WITH AI: ESSENTIAL TEMPLATES FOR HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP AUTOMATION
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Marketing teams want to adopt AI but they don't want brand-killing
automation or constant micromanagement. That's why teams are
abandoning one-shot prompting and adopting human-in-the-loop workflows
instead.

Get these workflow templates by Needle [4] for inspiration on how to
build AI agents that handle marketing tasks such as content generation

NEWS & TRENDS

 NEWS CREATORS EMERGING AS WINNERS IN BATTLE FOR ATTENTION (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 News creators are becoming key players in the news ecosystem, gaining
audience attention even in markets with strong legacy media. A Reuters
survey across 24 countries found that 48% of adults under 35 who use
social media prefer news creators over mainstream outlets, while 79%
use social media weekly for news. A Muck Rack study showed that
one-third of journalists are now creator journalists, though 40% earn
no income from their self-published work and 78% have fewer than
10,000 subscribers. As traditional newsrooms shrink, creators are
filling gaps in coverage and reshaping how audiences consume and
engage with news. 

 WHAT'S WORKING IN GTM RIGHT NOW (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 85% of enterprise sellers still rely on spreadsheets, with only 5%
using CRM. Companies use an average of 5 core GTM channels plus 5.5
experiments. Common channels include LinkedIn (66%), SEO (53%), and
warm outbound (48%). AI search and intent-based outbound are growing
fastest at 51% and 45%. Early-stage companies succeed with founder-led
channels, mature companies with scalable channels like conferences and
paid ads. AI tools like ChatGPT are widely used, but impact is mostly
in outbound, market intelligence, and content marketing. Emerging
tools like Clay, Lovable, and n8n help teams run technical workflows
and intent-driven campaigns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT'S IT LIKE TO MANAGE SOCIAL MEDIA AT BEST WESTERN (13 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Best Western runs its social strategy almost entirely through
creators, with 90% of content coming from influencer collaborations. A
two-person team manages over 100 creators a year who feature nearly
300 hotels through story-driven posts that spotlight local owners and
authentic hospitality. They focus on long-term relationships, giving
creators creative freedom to tell real travel stories. All outreach
and content management are handled in-house to keep the tone
consistent across platforms. 

 WHY A LOWER CTR CAN BE BETTER FOR YOUR PPC CAMPAIGNS (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Click-through rate alone is not a reliable measure of PPC success.
Ads with lower CTRs often yield higher conversion volume and better
ROI when evaluated using metrics like conversions per impression or
revenue per impression. This approach helps advertisers focus on
qualified traffic rather than volume. For B2B brands, refining ad copy
to filter out consumer clicks is especially critical to maintain
budget efficiency and lead quality.

 HOW TO: BUILD A CONTENT AUDIT ASSISTANT WITH SCREAMINGFROG AND AI (11
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A guide to building a content audit system with ScreamingFrog,
Claude, Zapier MCP, and Google Analytics to identify opportunities to
improve existing website content. AI cannot perform a full audit but
can support human analysis by combining data from crawls, performance
metrics, and SEO tools to highlight underperforming pages. The process
involves setting up a structured workflow connecting these tools
through Zapier, running site crawls, exporting data to Google Sheets,
and using AI prompts to find content improvement opportunities. AI
should be treated as an assistant rather than a practitioner. It
requires continuous refinement to produce reliable results. 

 DEMO VIDEO OF MARKETING GENIE (5 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 Marketing Genie is an AI-powered marketing assistant from
Fractionally Labs that helps startups and small businesses automate
their GTM efforts. It turns a single input like an idea or website
into meetings, content, partnerships, and revenue by combining
automation with the expertise of more than 350 fractional CMOs and
executives. This demo shows how Genie researches audiences and
competitors, crafts offers, and automates campaigns so founders can
grow faster.

 MARKETING ATTRIBUTION IS A LIE (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Marketing attribution often gives a false sense of understanding and
has led to a decline in creativity across the industry. Overreliance
on last-click attribution misguides companies into overfunding
performance channels like Google while neglecting brand awareness and
demand creation. Methods such as “How Did You Hear About Us”
surveys and Media Mix Modeling provide more reliable insights, but no
system can fully explain human decision-making. The best marketing
blends data with creativity, intuition, and a deep understanding of
customers rather than relying solely on dashboards and metrics. 

 THE CREATOR-AUDIENCE FIT PLAYBOOK (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The concept of creator-audience fit is focused on the idea that
consistent engagement is earned through relevance, not just reach.
Establishing fit involves studying audience behavior in digital
spaces, capturing their language, and building content formats that
reflect their current needs or interests. This playbook outlines how
to avoid generic or outdated content by clearly identifying what not
to produce and refining content direction through recurring feedback
loops. 

 WHY HORROR IS BIG BUSINESS FOR MARKETERS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Horror fandoms offer both seasonal reach and year-round commercial
value. Horror fans are highly discerning and respond best to content
that feels authentic to the genre. Seasonal audiences drive spikes
during October, but the core fanbase engages year-round through
initiatives like Halfway to Halloween. Forced integrations are quickly
rejected. Success comes when collaborations feel organic, such as
leveraging horror iconography or fan-led lore.
