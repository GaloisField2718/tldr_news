NEWS & TRENDS

 INSIDE THE GREAT EGG BRANDING CRISIS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Egg prices have surged 40% this year. This has challenged consumer
brand loyalty and purchasing habits. Specialty egg brands like
Consider Pastures have struggled, as most consumers now prioritize
affordability over premium attributes. The American Egg Board has
shifted its messaging from promoting eggs as a healthy choice to
emphasizing their affordability and safety amid the bird flu crisis.
Just Egg, a plant-based alternative, is capitalizing on shortages,
seeing a 70% YOY sales increase and positioning itself as a stable
option in an unstable market.

LIKELIHOOD THAT CONSUMERS WILL TRY NEW BRANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consumers are more likely to try new brands when product choices
conflict with their active goals. Studies found that gym-goers,
focused on health, were more likely to choose an unfamiliar candy bar
over a familiar one, while those in a dining hall stuck with known
brands. Similar patterns emerged with cookies and trash bags, showing
that ambiguity helps justify new choices. This shows the importance of
positioning novel brands in contexts where they challenge consumer
goals, making them more appealing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FUNNELS VS. FLOWS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most B2B marketers rely on content funnels, but content flows are
more effective. Funnels assume a linear path: ad, landing page,
download, email nurture, and purchase. However, B2B buyers jump
between channels and expect a seamless experience. Content flows meet
them where they are and guide them naturally. Create interconnected
content, where each piece leads to the next, such as linking a YouTube
video to a blog or encouraging email sign-ups through blog content.
Break down silos by having SEO, social, and email teams collaborate to
ensure all channels align with a shared goal. 

 MARKETING HACKS I STOLE FROM OPERATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Marketing works best when built on strong operations. Clear roles,
accountability, and real-time data keep teams aligned, while agile
processes ensure adaptability. Customer experience should drive every
marketing decision, as no campaign can fix a broken operation. When
The Joint Chiropractic saw low conversions despite strong digital
campaigns, the issue was slow response times, not marketing.
Conversion rates jumped 15% by improving follow-ups. The best
marketing leaders think like operators.

RESOURCES & TOOLS

 HOW TO CALCULATE COST PER OPPORTUNITY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Marketing cost and opportunity calculations depend on whether the
focus is efficiency or cost. The marketing customer acquisition cost
ratio is a better efficiency metric than total marketing cost per
opportunity because it is standardized, widely used, and has more
benchmark data. When focusing merely on cost, avoid using the average
total marketing cost per opportunity as it leads to overestimation.
Instead, use the incremental cost per opportunity. 

 MARCH CONTENT PLAN MAKEOVER (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 To level up your content in one hour, open your content calendar and
transfer ideas into a tool like Google Sheets or Notion. Next,
evaluate each idea with 4 key questions, including how it relates to
your audience, what you aim to achieve, how you can add more brand
perspective, and what related content you have in your archives.
Finally, refine the ideas based on your evaluation to ensure they are
impactful.

 HOW INSTANT-RAMEN MARKETER SAMYANG BUILT GEN ALPHA'S FAVORITE BRAND
(3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Samyang built brand love by engaging directly with fans and turning
viral moments into real-world activations. When a TikTok video showed
a young girl overjoyed by a Buldak ramen gift, the brand responded
with a personalized Buldak-themed party. Its agile US marketing team
leverages digital, experiential, and omnichannel strategies to deepen
connections and expand its retail presence. From in-person activations
like “sauce exchange” pop-ups to creative responses like Denmark's
“Buldak Spicy Ferry,” Samyang consistently celebrates consumer
enthusiasm. 

 HOW AI IS TEARING UP THE EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING RULEBOOK (9 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Experiential marketing is shifting from one-time activations into
living, self-optimizing systems. AI-powered experiences react and
adapt in real time based on participant inputs, blurring the lines
between physical and digital spaces. Emotionally responsive
environments, generative AI-driven storytelling, and spatial computing
will reshape how companies engage with customers. Experiences will
become more than just immersive - they will be sentient, learning from
each interaction and continuously adapting to individuals.
