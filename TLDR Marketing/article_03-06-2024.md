NEWS & TRENDS

 TIKTOK PREPARING A US COPY OF THE APP'S CORE ALGORITHM, SOURCES SAY
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok is working on a clone of its recommendation algorithm for its
US users. This may result in a version that operates independently of
its Chinese parent that might be more palatable to American lawmakers
who want to ban it. Once the code is split, it could lay the
groundwork for a divestiture of the company's US assets. 

 META SAYS THE FUTURE OF FACEBOOK IS YOUNG ADULTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

platform towards recommendations rather than posts from friends. It is
focusing on attracting the next generation of social media consumers.
The company is using AI to improve recommendations for Reels and the
feed. 

 SNAPCHAT'S USER BASE IS GROWING UP (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Snapchat isn't just for kids - close to 25% of its users are 35+. The
company recently reported 422M daily active users. Its new ad features

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 12 FIELD-TESTED CONTENT MARKETING TACTICS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Targeting low-competition keywords allows sites to rank faster as
backlinks aren't required. Creating an SEO content hub builds topical
authority, link authority, and perceived value. Repurposing content,
such as creating a video from a blog post, allows you to reach a wider
audience across platforms. 

 5 TYPES OF PROOF IN COPYWRITING THAT CONVERT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Adding proof elements to copy is one of the best ways to strengthen
messaging. Use specific statements, such as quantified numbers, to
make it believable. Point to the opinions of others, such as reviews
or social media. Show how the product or service is used so visitors
can imagine how it might work for their situation. Display authority
with logos of the companies that work with you, awards and industry
certifications, or proof of industry involvement. 

 HOW TO USE LINKEDIN AS A PRIMARY ‚ÄúPR‚Äù CHANNEL (2 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 If you run marketing at a B2B startup, ensure the founder, head of
marketing, sales, and customer success share content on LinkedIn 3-5X
a week. Share quick write-ups after customer calls, learnings from
pain points, and content from the life or job of the person they're
trying to sell to. It doesn't have to be polished, but it should
contain real tactical examples, experiences, and lessons. Create a
list of target customers and connect with everyone on LinkedIn, as
over 50% of people will accept connections. Consistently comment on
posts for 6+ months from people in your industry to boost your
visibility and engagement.

 MINDSHARE MATTERS. NOW MARKETERS CAN MEASURE IT (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mindshare measurement offers marketers a way to directly link brand
investment to sales and shareholder returns by focusing on
high-demand, low-competition areas. By targeting specific demand
spaces and understanding the S-curve of mindshare growth, brands can
increase their visibility and customer receptivity, leading to higher
conversion rates. This strategy involves sustained investment,
strategic targeting, and leveraging both paid and organic channels to
create lasting impressions and build a competitive advantage. 

 HOW LONG DOES ADVERTISING LAST? (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The advertising industry is divided between advocates of long-term
brand building and short-term performance. Studies indicate that if an
ad campaign doesn't perform well initially, it likely won't improve
over time. Financial returns from advertising can start as early as 61
weeks, but often take up to 150 weeks. Advertising has a significant
carryover effect, decaying at about 30% per year. While traditional
media is often seen as superior, newer research indicates that online,
content-integrated ads are far more effective.
