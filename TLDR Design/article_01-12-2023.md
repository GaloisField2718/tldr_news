CELEBRATES CONVERSATION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Reddit's fresh identity was created by New York studio Pentagram.
Pentagram agreed early on to point back to four values: inherently
eclectic, positively different, delightfully absurd, and genuinely
candid. It took the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendered it in 3D and
customized Reddit Sans, one of the company's proprietary typefaces,
turning the rounded counter forms of its lowercase letters into
bubbles as a nod to Reddit's interface.

 HOW TO THINK STRATEGICALLY AS A DESIGNER AND UNDERSTAND PRODUCT
VISION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most designers start as tactical designers, align themselves with the
product or the engineering team, and work without a vision. Designers

solutions, and learning to persuade high-ranking people. 

 THE TYRANNY OF CONSISTENCY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The change in Google‚Äôs app icons in 2020 is a notorious and

it.
