 WACOM SAYS ITS FIRST OLED DRAWING TABLET IS COOL AND SKINNY (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Wacom has launched Movink 13, a light and thin OLED pen display
tablet aimed at digital creatives. It provides advantages like deeper
blacks, a broader color spectrum, and lower pen latency. This is the
thinnest and lightest Wacom pen display yet. At $750, it's a portable
and more affordable alternative to the expected OLED iPad Pro but
requires connection to an external device for operation. 

 WITH EASEL, EX-SNAP RESEARCHERS ARE BUILDING THE NEXT-GENERATION
BITMOJI THANKS TO AI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Founded by two former Snap employees, Easel lets you create images of
yourself and your friends doing extraordinary things. By capturing a
few seconds of the user's face, the app creates a corresponding AI
model and uses Stable Diffusion's generative AI to make Bitmoji-style
stickers. Easel can be integrated into the native iOS Message
application, enabling users to send the creations as images. 

 THIS GAME BOY-LOOKING PHONE STAND IS WHY MAGSAFE IS GOOD (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Although people have mixed feelings about MagSafe's charging
efficiency and case compatibility, the Elago MagSafe MS W5 Charging
Stand adds a touch of nostalgia by imitating the Game Boy Advance SP
design but without functional buttons. Available on Amazon, this
charming stand is purely aesthetic and doesn't include a charger, yet
it can support both iPhones and new Qi2 Android devices with MagSafe.

 HOW TO AVOID DESIGNING FOR CURRENT USERS AT THE EXPENSE OF FUTURE
ONES (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Businesses often prioritize current customers, potentially neglecting
future users. Sales teams may need to pay more attention to deeper
user needs than UX teams. To design for present and future users,
designers must focus on user-centric requirements, leverage sales
demos, and collaborate with the product team to prioritize features
effectively.

 RABBIT R1: I SPENT 17 HOURS WITH IT ‚Äî AND SOMETHING'S IFFY ABOUT IT
(6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mashable reviewed the new Rabbit R1 and found that the gestures were
addictive. It can't browse the web, doesn't text or make calls,
responds faster than expected, gets some answers wrong, can see and
describe things, and has a good battery life. With a price tag of
$199, it seems too good to be true, and the company will find a way to
squeeze more money out of its user base. 

 WHY WE MOVED AWAY FROM PRIMARY, SECONDARY, AND TERTIARY BUTTONS (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The hierarchical button style paradigm classifies buttons into
primary, secondary, and tertiary importance in product design.
However, there are better approaches for brands that use color
playfully. This article shows how switching from hierarchy to emphasis
enabled a better color system for brands that explore a broader color
spectrum. 

 THE LEGOISM OF DESIGN SYSTEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Jim Nielsen discusses the limitations of the "LEGO" analogy for
design systems, arguing that prefabricated components have less value
in the age of generative AI and open-source libraries. Even with
prefabricated components, custom "one-off" designs are still necessary
for each product, and a successful design system needs more than just
prefabrication and composition.
