 Jumping straight to visual design without establishing conceptual
fidelity risks creating superficial solutions. The "form factor trap"
occurs when the focus is on deliverables rather than the value they

benefits can prevent this, ensuring designs meet user needs.
Optimizing for speed and deliverables can undermine a design's actual
value, leading to complete and practical solutions.
