 REPORT: 38% OF DESIGNERS EXCITED ABOUT AI CREATIVITY BOOST, BUT 33%
LACK AI SKILLS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Are designers afraid of AI taking their jobs? No - but many of them
aren't sure where to start.

Fresh survey data [4] from 2,000+ product and design professionals
shows that many are enthusiastic about AI enhancing creativity - and
the barrier to adoption is often training rather than fear. Also in
the report:

 	* Detailed data about AI usage among different members of product
teams.
 	* How AI is democratizing design — enabling product managers to
create concepts, engineers to prototype, and designers to code.
 	* A 3-part framework [4] for AI leadership: education, clear
strategy, and visible wins.

 LEAKER SHARES ALLEGED IPHONE 17 TECHWOVEN CASE COLORS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple is rumored to replace its failed FineWoven cases with new
“TechWoven” ones that feature a more technical look. Leaker Majin
Bu has shared images showing five colors: orange, purple, green, blue,
and gray. Close-ups reveal small dings on both blue and black cases,
raising concerns about durability. 

 AI WEBSITE BUILDER LOVABLE INCREASINGLY ABUSED FOR MALICIOUS ACTIVITY
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting Lovable, an AI-powered
website builder, to create phishing pages and malware-dropping sites
that impersonate major brands. Proofpoint researchers identified tens
of thousands of malicious Lovable URLs since February, including
campaigns targeting Microsoft credentials, UPS payment fraud,
cryptocurrency theft, and zgRAT malware distribution. While Lovable
has implemented real-time detection systems and claims to have blocked
around 1,000 violating projects, security researchers confirmed the
platform can still be used to generate fraudulent sites. 

 QWEN-IMAGE EDIT GIVES PHOTOSHOP A RUN FOR ITS MONEY WITH AI-POWERED
TEXT-TO-IMAGE EDITS THAT WORK IN SECONDS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Qwen-Image Edit is an open-source AI model that performs
Photoshop-like image editing tasks using simple text instructions in
seconds. Built on a 20-billion-parameter foundation model, it handles
both semantic transformations and precise appearance changes while
supporting bilingual text editing in English and Chinese. The model is
available across multiple platforms. API access starts at $0.045 per
image, with a free quota of 100 images valid for 180 days after
account activation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF COLOR IN UX DESIGN AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A Google designer explores how color functions as a strategic tool in
digital design, influencing user behavior through psychological
associations while reinforcing brand identity and creating emotional
connections. The piece outlines the HSB color model and explains how
different hues carry cultural meanings that can guide user perception
and decision-making in digital products. Key considerations include
building accessible color systems that meet WCAG contrast
requirements, creating scalable palettes that work across touchpoints,
and maintaining consistency to establish brand recognition and user
trust. 

 VIBE CODING MAKES PROTOTYPING CLOSE TO CODE, CLOSER TO USERS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vibe coding transforms prototyping by allowing designers to express
interaction goals in natural language while AI translates them into
working code and functional prototypes. This approach enables
designers to prototype closer to real applications rather than static
mockups, creating immediate feedback loops and bringing accessibility
considerations into the process much earlier. The method has become
essential for rapid innovation, deeper cross-disciplinary
collaboration, and building more inclusive experiences that reflect
real-world complexity. 

 WHY USE DESIGN TOKENS? SEVEN PRACTICAL REASONS DESIGNERS AND
DEVELOPERS SWEAR BY (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Design tokens are named, reusable variables that store visual design
attributes like colors and typography, replacing hardcoded values with
self-explanatory names for consistency across digital products. They
offer key benefits: ensuring design consistency across platforms,
speeding up workflows through automation, enabling seamless rebranding
and theming, bridging designer-developer communication gaps,
future-proofing design systems, reducing human error and technical
debt, and powering advanced automation tools. Unlike static style
guides, tokens update instantly across all platforms when changed in
one central location, making them essential for scalable design
systems.

 ONLY BALANCES HERITAGE WITH CULTURE IN CAMBRIDGE AUDIO'S
SOPHISTICATED REBRAND (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cambridge's new brand platform, Made by Music, draws from its
music-driven culture to position the company at the center of
contemporary music life through events, partnerships, and culturally
relevant storytelling. The refreshed identity uses bold typography, a
flexible logotype and marque system, and a restrained yet expressive
color palette to balance premium design with cultural energy. 

 FROM SKIM TO SUBSTANCE: DESIGNING THE FUTURE OF READING (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Benjamin Cain criticizes “skimmable texts” as shallow and fake,
but this response argues skimming is a real adaptation to fragmented
attention and time scarcity in the digital age. Instead of rejecting
it, writers and designers should treat skimming as the entry point,
using curation and layered formats to guide readers from quick scans
into depth, turning a glance into lasting engagement. 

 YELLOW, PURPLE, AND THE MYTH OF “ACCESSIBILITY LIMITS COLOR
PALETTES” (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The myth that accessibility requirements severely limit color palette
choices is debunked through six WCAG-compliant yellow and purple color
palettes that work in both light and dark modes. A detailed Figma
tutorial demonstrates how to create accessible palettes by testing
contrast ratios and documenting safe color combinations. Accessibility
enhances rather than restricts creativity, providing designers with
practical tools for building inclusive color systems.
