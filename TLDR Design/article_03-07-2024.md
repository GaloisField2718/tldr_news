 Figma CEO Dylan Field announced the temporary disabling of the
company's ‚ÄúMake Design‚Äù AI feature after it was found to replicate

from text prompts quickly, faces accusations of being trained on
existing apps, which Field denies, attributing the issue to inadequate
quality assurance. Figma will suspend the feature until a robust QA
process is implemented to ensure the originality and reliability of
its outputs.
