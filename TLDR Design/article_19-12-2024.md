effectiveness for general queries, more complex searches or niche
requirements might still produce inconsistent results, indicating room
for further refinement.

 THE NEW EUROVISION LOGO HAS TRIGGERED A DEEP DESIGN DEBATE (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The unveiling of the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 logo for Basel has
sparked debate. Fans criticized its lack of novelty, as the design
closely resembles previous years' logos and shifts focus to

global branding, many lament the loss of unique, event-specific logos
that once added personality and excitement to each year's contest.
