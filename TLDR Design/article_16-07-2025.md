 NEXTDOOR REDESIGNS APP WITH AI RECOMMENDATIONS, LOCAL NEWS, AND
REAL-TIME EMERGENCY ALERTS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nextdoor has launched a major redesign of its app, introducing
real-time emergency alerts, local news partnerships with over 3,500
publishers, and an AI-powered recommendation tool called "Faves" that
draws on 15 years of user conversations. The updates aim to reverse
declining engagement by positioning the platform as a practical,
hyperlocal utility rather than just a social network. CEO Nirav Tolia
emphasized that Nextdoor's value lies in its ability to deliver
personalized, neighborhood-specific information that can't be found on
broader platforms like Google or ChatGPT.

 SOMEBODY FINALLY SAID IT: APPLE IS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Apple is facing growing criticism over a string of underwhelming
product launches and its sluggish entry into the AI space, with
research firm LightShed suggesting the company may need a new, more
product-focused CEO to remain competitive. As rivals surge ahead in AI
innovation, commentators argue that under Tim Cook's leadership, Apple
has lost its edge in design and breakthrough hardware, raising doubts
about its future growth trajectory. 

 DID AI KILL THE SYSTEM'S THINKING SKILLS IN UX? (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is transforming product design by enabling rapid prototyping,
automating tasks, and streamlining collaboration, but its speed and
convenience risk overshadowing critical thinking and systems-level
understanding. While AI can be a powerful accelerator, designers must
avoid over-reliance on tools and maintain a strong foundation in
strategic thinking, user insight, and holistic problem-solving to
ensure quality, purpose-driven outcomes.

 STATE OF DESIGN RECRUITING IN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Design recruiting has shifted dramatically, with portfolios now
completely overtaking resumes as recruiters skip straight to
evaluating craft quality and business impact metrics. Companies
prioritize collaboration skills and strong design opinions that AI
cannot replicate, making designer conviction a make-or-break factor in
startup hiring. Most design hires still happen through word-of-mouth
referrals rather than cold applications, with active community
participation becoming crucial for early-career designers. 

 HOW NEURODESIGN IS RESHAPING USER EXPERIENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Neurodesign combines neuroscience, psychology, and design to create
digital experiences that align with the brain's natural processing of
information. The approach applies principles like Hick's Law, Miller's
Law, and Fitts's Law to reduce cognitive load and make interfaces more
intuitive by respecting visual scanning patterns and memory
limitations. Designers now use eye-tracking technology, heat maps, and
AI-powered attention prediction tools to measure and optimize
brain-friendly user experiences.

details and supports over 600 languages, advancing Penguin's mission
of making books accessible to all.
