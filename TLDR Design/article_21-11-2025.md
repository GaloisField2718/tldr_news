NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA INTRODUCES MAKE CONNECTORS FOR EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Figma's Make Connectors enables direct integration of external tools
like Notion, Asana, Linear, GitHub, and Jira into Figma Make via the
Model Context Protocol. The feature allows teams to import documents
and tasks, refresh data in real time, and create or modify records in
connected apps without leaving Figma, with granular access controls
and user approval required for write operations. Make Connectors are
available on paid plans. 

 LUMA AI RAISES $900 MILLION FROM SAUDI-BACKED HUMAIN (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Luma AI has secured $900 million in funding, led by Saudi-backed
HUMAIN, bringing total funding to over $1 billion at a reported $4
billion valuation. The startup, known for Dream Machine and the Ray
model, will use the capital to advance large-scale World Models and
become one of the first customers of HUMAIN's two-gigawatt Project
Halo supercluster in Saudi Arabia. Additional investors include AMD,
Amazon, Andreessen Horowitz, Amplify Partners, and Matrix Partners.
The funding was announced during Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin
Salman's US state visit. 

 CHATGPT LAUNCHES GROUP CHATS GLOBALLY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT has rolled out group chats worldwide, letting up to 20 people
collaborate with each other and the assistant in a shared
conversation. The feature is designed to help users plan, create,
research, and make decisions together while keeping individual
settings private. OpenAI sees this as a step toward making ChatGPT a
more social and collaborative platform rather than a purely one-on-one
tool.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 TO GROW, WE MUST FORGET… BUT NOW AI REMEMBERS EVERYTHING (13 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI systems with infinite memory risk trapping users in outdated
versions of themselves by constantly reinforcing past preferences and
behaviors. Human forgetting evolved as a survival advantage that
enables adaptation, creativity, and growth, but memory-enabled AI
creates echo chambers that stagnate cognitive development by
optimizing for comfort over challenge. The solution requires action at
three levels: users must actively manage their stored data, UX
designers should build flexible "sketchpad" memory interfaces with
expiration dates and revision tools, and developers should engineer
adaptive forgetting systems that mimic the brain's natural memory
processes. 

 AN ALTERNATIVE CHAT UI LAYOUT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post proposes a dual-scroll pane layout for AI chat interfaces
to address usability issues posed by agentic features such as thinking
traces and tool calls. The design separates user instructions and AI
process in one column from results in another, keeping both in context
without excessive scrolling. This approach aims to solve the problem
of long AI monologues pushing initial messages off-screen,
particularly in narrow side panels. 

 OPENAI'S INDGILA SAMAD ALI ON WHAT REMAINS HUMAN IN DESIGN (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Indgila Sadykova describes a whirlwind first year at OpenAI, where
the pace is intense and design decisions instantly reach millions, but
where close collaboration with research makes the work emotionally
rich and constantly evolving. Shaped by Russian and Persian
influences, she sees design as creating human connection at scale,
approaches AI as a creative collaborator rather than a threat, and
believes that intuition, emotion, and sensitivity will always remain
the fundamentally human core of the craft.

 HOW DESIGN SYSTEMS TEAMS ARE USING AI TOOLS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design systems teams are achieving dramatic efficiency gains by
integrating AI tools with appropriate context—using local code
environments, maintaining Markdown documentation that AI can
automatically reference, and building internal tools like token
validators and usage analyzers. Key enablers include MCP servers that
give AI direct access to Figma files, GitHub repos, and design tokens,
as well as automated workflows that reduce component development time.
Teams seeing the best results start with their biggest bottleneck,
build incrementally over several weeks, and focus on providing AI with
comprehensive context. 

 WHEN THE DARK PATTERN IS A GLARING GREEN CHECKMARK (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 After missing the online check-in window, the author couldn't find
their boarding pass because the airline app misleadingly showed a
green checkmark next to “check-in,” suggesting success even though
the action had actually failed. Low-contrast text hid the real status,
resulting in a €48 fee, and highlighting how poor visual hierarchy,
misleading symbols, and lack of proactive communication turned a
preventable system limitation into a user-blamed error. 

 EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING WRONG WITH DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The design industry is trapped in a cycle of overproduction, weak
circular practices, and risk-averse corporate decision-making, all
while lacking diversity and pricing most people out of high-quality
goods. Despite rising awareness of environmental and social issues,
excessive consumption, market turbulence, and a flood of shallow
brand-driven experiences keep meaningful progress limited.
