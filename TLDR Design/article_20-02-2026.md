NEWS & TRENDS

 CANVA GETS TO $4B IN REVENUE AS LLM REFERRAL TRAFFIC RISES (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Canva closed 2025 with $4 billion in annual recurring revenue, over
265 million monthly active users, and a 20% increase in MAUs driven
partly by AI tool adoption. The company is pivoting from a design
platform with AI features to an "AI platform with design tools," while
integrating with chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude. LLM referral
traffic is now growing in double-digit percentages, and Canva is
actively investing in surfacing its content through AI-powered search.


 THIS NEW AI ‘EYEDROPPER' TOOL BRINGS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL UX
TRICKS INTO THE AI AGE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Variant's new AI eyedropper feature lets users click on one generated
interface to transfer its style onto another. However, the tool's
usefulness is limited because Variant's AI engine produces designs
that already look too similar, and it can't sample from external
sources like bitmaps or Figma. The feature nonetheless points toward a
promising direction: giving designers direct manipulation tools for AI
instead of relying on imprecise text prompts. 

 NOTHING'S LATEST STUNT OUTRAGES APPLE FANS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ahead of Apple's 4 March event, Nothing cheekily hijacked the hype by
spray-painting “Nothing” and “5th March” over Apple's invite,
likely teasing the Nothing Phone (4a) Pro launch a day later. While
some fans praised the bold, counter-culture stunt, others slammed it
as unprofessional, though the move reinforces Nothing's provocative
brand identity and willingness to challenge Apple's dominance.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 RITE TESTING: HOW TO TEST AI-DRIVEN PRODUCTS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 RITE (Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation) offers a scrappier,
cheaper alternative to formalized UX research by testing with smaller
groups and iterating prototypes in real time. Traditional user testing
has become too expensive and siloed, often producing reports rather
than actionable solutions, making it vulnerable to AI-based
alternatives. By focusing on co-creating use cases with real users
early in the process, RITE testing helps teams build products people
actually want to buy. 

 IT'S TIME FOR APPLE TO LET GO OF 60HZ DISPLAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple has treated 120Hz ProMotion displays as a premium feature for
nearly a decade, limiting them mostly to Pro devices due to the
smoother experience they provide. Given the large price gaps between
mid-range and Pro models, and the fact that Apple's products aren't
cheap to begin with, it feels outdated for devices like the iPad Air
and MacBook Air to still ship with 60Hz displays instead of at least
90Hz or 120Hz. 

 COGNITIVE SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AGE OF PERSONALISATION ALGORITHMS (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern personalized systems don't just reduce friction—they
increasingly shape what we think about next, optimising for engagement
over understanding and quietly eroding “cognitive sovereignty,”
the ability to explore and decide independently. The challenge isn't
personalization itself, but business models and design defaults that
prioritize retention over agency, making it crucial to build systems
with transparency, user control, friction where needed, and space for
genuine discovery rather than tightly steered attention.

 THE NEXT RENAISSANCE: WHY CREATIVITY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE AI AGE (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 As AI automates repetitive tasks, human creativity, imagination, and
the ability to ask better questions are becoming the most valuable
professional assets. The World Economic Forum projects 92 million jobs
displaced by 2030 but 170 million new roles created, with creative
thinking among the fastest-growing skills in demand. Rather than
competing with machines, the next decade will reward those who
leverage AI for analytical tasks while applying uniquely human
qualities like intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking. 

 BUILD SOMETHING SILLY (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI tools now let non-developers build custom software. This author
rebuilt a website and created a personal invoicing tool using Cursor
and Claude, replacing paid SaaS subscriptions. Wall Street has taken
notice too, with SaaS stocks losing $285 billion after Anthropic
released new AI tools, signaling a shift in how individuals and small
businesses approach software. The key takeaway isn't any specific
tool, but the mindset shift from "what should I subscribe to?" to
"could I build this myself?" — a muscle best developed by starting
small. 

 FILL YOUR OWN CUP WITH WHAT GIVES YOU ENERGY (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 To balance creativity with performance demands, intentionally protect
two or three high-energy time blocks each week for meaningful, focused
work—shielding them from meetings and inbox noise—so creativity
becomes a structured priority rather than an indulgence, ultimately
improving both impact and productivity.
