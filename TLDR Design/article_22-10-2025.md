 ADOBE LAUNCHES A FOUNDRY SERVICE THAT BUILDS CUSTOM GENERATIVE AI
MODELS FOR ENTERPRISES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Adobe AI Foundry is a service that enables enterprises to build
custom generative AI models trained on their own branding and
intellectual property to create text, images, video, and 3D content.
The models are built on Adobe's Firefly family, which uses only
licensed training data and is priced based on usage rather than per
seat. The service helps brands scale personalized advertising
campaigns across different seasons, languages, and formats while
keeping humans at the center of creativity. 

 GOOGLE PLAY STORE ADOPTS MATERIAL 3 EXPRESSIVE DESIGN FOR ENHANCED UX
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Play Store is implementing Material 3 Expressive design,
introducing bolder colors, fluid animations, and adaptive layouts to
create more intuitive and engaging app discovery experiences. The
redesign extends across Android's ecosystem, including the Phone app
and Wear OS, with phased rollouts planned alongside future Pixel
launches to gather user feedback. This strategic shift aims to enhance
user retention and discoverability in a competitive marketplace,
responding to rivals like Samsung's One UI 7 while offering developers
new personalization tools. 

 IOS 26.1 BETA 4 ADDS NEW SETTING TO TONE DOWN LIQUID GLASS
TRANSPARENCY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26
introduced a transparent, fluid look across devices. In response to
user feedback, iOS 26.1 beta 4 now adds a “Tinted” option to make
Liquid Glass more opaque and contrasted. It is available under Display
& Brightness (iPhone/iPad) or Appearance (Mac), and applies
system-wide, including third-party apps.

 THE END OF THE USER INTERFACE? HOW AI AGENTS ARE REWRITING UX (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI agents are transforming user experience by enabling task
delegation through natural language rather than traditional
screen-based interactions, shifting design focus from pixel-perfect
interfaces to trust, transparency, and conversational systems. This
evolution is powered by generative AI, large language models, and
hyperpersonalization that allow agents to understand intent, automate
complex workflows, and adapt to individual users autonomously. UX
professionals must now develop new skills in agent design, dialogue
modeling, and ethical AI practices as interfaces become ambient and
intelligence-based rather than visual. 

 AI STARTUPS RISK FORGETTING THE ‘U' IN UX (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Enterprise AI faces a 95% pilot failure rate essentially because
startups prioritize technological capability over user experience,
creating powerful but unusable tools that don't integrate into
existing workflows. Definely's co-founders discovered that solving
enterprise problems in legacy industries requires embedding real users
with lived experience into product teams, ensuring technology serves
established workflows rather than disrupting them. The AI companies
that will survive the coming disillusionment focus on transparent,
user-centric solutions requiring minimal behavioral change, not those
with the most advanced models. 

 THE WRITING IS THE DESIGN (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX writing is integral to design because words shape how users
experience products. The Usable, Useful, Responsible framework
promotes clear, respectful, and ethical language. Writers should align
with strategy, use AI thoughtfully with empathy and clarity, and craft
error messages that prevent, explain, and resolve issues.

 WHY DESIGN CRAFT STILL MATTERS IN A WORLD OF AUTOMATION (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AI tools can quickly generate design elements but lack the human
judgment needed to create meaningful brand identities for nonprofits.
True design craft involves deep listening, cultural understanding, and
strategic decision-making that machines cannot replicate, transforming
organizational values into trusted visual identities. While AI can
accelerate exploration, public-facing brand work requires trained
designers to ensure consistency, authenticity, and lasting impact over
generic, homogenized aesthetics.
