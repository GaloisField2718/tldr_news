 GRAMMARLY GETS A DESIGN OVERHAUL, MULTIPLE AI FEATURES (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Grammarly has launched a redesigned document-based interface built on
Coda technology featuring multiple AI tools, including an assistant, a
grader, a citation finder, and a plagiarism detector. The new
block-first approach allows users to insert various elements while AI
tools provide personalized feedback, detect AI-generated content, and
assist with writing tasks. Despite offering both AI writing assistance
and AI detection capabilities, Grammarly positions itself as helping
students learn proper AI usage for workforce preparation. 

 EDIT IMAGES IN GOOGLE PHOTOS BY SIMPLY ASKING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Photos now allows users to edit images through natural
language commands, with advanced Gemini AI capabilities processing
requests like "remove the cars" or "make it better" without requiring
manual tool selection. The feature supports both corrective edits and
creative changes, enabling multiple requests in a single prompt and
follow-up refinements for precise results. Google is also implementing
C2PA Content Credentials in Photos to provide transparency about AI
edits, starting with Pixel 10 devices before expanding to other
Android and iOS platforms.

LIBRARIES, MORE (1 MINUTE READ) [6]

introducing new glass effects with customizable controls like blur,
distortion, depth, and chromatic aberration. The update also adds
tools such as concentric corners, progressive blurs, improved styling,
and an updated Apple UI library with macOS 26 and iOS 26 assets.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY "GOOD UX" ISN'T ENOUGH (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UX teams often focus solely on usability—smooth interactions and
clean interfaces—but this is like thinking a motorcycle only needs
fuel to run, when it requires air, fuel, compression, and spark
working together. Products fail despite good usability because teams
ignore the fact that value emerges from being useful, usable,
findable, credible, accessible, and desirable. Audit products against
all six dimensions and partner across disciplines to identify which
missing element might become the product's critical weakness, shifting
focus from usability tunnel vision to holistic value creation. 

 HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT AWARDS AND LOVE MAKING REAL
IMPACT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design agency Stocks Taylor Benson abandoned awards submissions to
redirect creative hours and entry fees into "Good Deeds," a structured
pro bono program supporting community projects in Leicester. Over six
years, it has invested 2,500 design hours (7% of studio capacity) into
local partnerships that generate genuine business connections, enhance
tender responses, and create measurable returns beyond trophy
validation. The community-focused strategy has delivered stronger
networks, improved credibility with clients, and positioned the studio
as embedded local partners rather than place-agnostic competitors. 

 YOUR DESIGN PROCESS IS TOO SLOW (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design Thinking emphasizes iterative, user-centered problem-solving,
while traditional methods like Waterfall are slow and inefficient due
to late feedback and siloed teams. Generative AI accelerates
creativity and workflows but raises ethical and privacy concerns,
making Agile principles—rapid iteration, collaboration, and frequent
delivery—essential for modern design.

 EIGHT TIPS FOR DESIGNERS BUILDING BRANDED TEMPLATES IN FIGMA BUZZ (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brand designers can create effective self-serve templates in Figma
Buzz by starting in Figma Design frames and using auto layout for
responsive elements that maintain alignment when content changes. Key
practices include separating text layers for different inputs, locking
aspect ratios on images to prevent distortion, and giving layers clear
descriptive names like "Event Title" rather than generic defaults.
Before publishing, designers should test templates from a user
perspective in Figma Buzz to ensure smooth editing experiences and
provide proper context when sharing with marketing teams. 

 ON A DAILY BASIS CREATES A MODULAR IDENTITY FROM AMSTERDAM'S TRAM
SYSTEM (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The new identity for De Hallen was inspired by Amsterdam's tram
symbols, using them as a metaphor for connection and diversity. The
system combines three geometric forms from the building's
architecture, the Bugrino typeface, and a neighbourhood-based colour
palette, resulting in a flexible, modular design that celebrates
contrast while maintaining coherence across signage, campaigns, and
events.
