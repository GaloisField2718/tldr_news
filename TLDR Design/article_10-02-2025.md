NEWS & TRENDS

 ASPECT RATIO, LOCKED (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma now lets users lock the aspect ratio of frames, shapes, images,
videos, vectors, and text for proportional scaling. This replaces
Constrain proportions, allowing resizing from the properties panel or
canvas. Previously constrained objects require manually applying the
new Lock aspect ratio feature. 

 THE YOUTUBE LOGO CHANGED COLOUR, AND PEOPLE ARE ONLY JUST NOTICING (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The YouTube logo has undergone a subtle color change, with the logo
itself becoming slightly pinker. This change occurred in October, but
people are only starting to notice it now. The change departs from the
platform's usual release of unique edition designs for specific events
or holidays. 

 GOOGLE IS ADDING DIGITAL WATERMARKS TO IMAGES EDITED WITH MAGIC
EDITOR AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI-edited images in Google Photos now include a digital watermark,
starting with the Reimagine feature in Magic Editor on Pixel 9.
Developed by DeepMind, SynthID embeds watermarks without altering
images. This approach enhances transparency as AI-generated content
becomes more realistic, though minor edits may not always trigger
marking.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SIMPLIFY YOUR PRODUCT DESIGN — BORROW FAMILIAR PATTERNS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Familiar design patterns make products feel intuitive. WhatsApp
mimicked phone OS layouts to ensure ease of use. Consistent UI
elements build predictability, while strategic button placement
enhances usability. Even complex AI chatbots succeed by borrowing
familiar messaging interfaces, proving that simplicity comes from
aligning with users' habits and expectations. 

 THE FLYWHEEL OF BRAND (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Marty Neumeier's The Brand Flip argued that consumers now shape
brands. Since 2015, short-form video, personal branding,
product-as-content, and rising consumer expectations have intensified
this shift. The Flywheel of the Brand model emphasizes products as the
key driver of trust, brand-building, and differentiation, replacing
traditional marketing-heavy approaches. 

 IT'S TIME FOR DESIGN TO THINK LESS AND FEEL MORE (14 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Darren Yeo argues that an overly rational approach to design
overlooks opportunities for innovation and human connection,
emphasizing the need to engage emotions alongside logic. He advocates
for a more holistic approach that integrates emotional intelligence
and the arts, challenging the analytical focus in education and the
design industry.

 CHAT INTERFACES AND DECLARING INTENT (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI-powered chat interfaces have revolutionized user intent capture,
evolving from information retrieval to manipulation and action
execution. Unlike past systems that required users to adapt, today's
interfaces understand natural language and handle diverse requests. As
AI advances, UI design should minimize unnecessary constraints,
allowing computers to interpret human intent more seamlessly. 

 REDEFINING UX: BEHAVIOR AND ANTICIPATORY DESIGN IN THE AGE OF AI (22
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Technology simplifies life but also causes overload. Anticipatory
design, using AI to predict needs, often fails due to poor
understanding of behavior. Success requires balancing automation with
user control, personalization, and timely interventions, leveraging
behavior models like B=MAP, the Transtheoretical Model, and the Nudge
Theory while addressing data quality and privacy. 

 DOES THE DESIGN INDUSTRY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GHOSTING? (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Ghosting is a rising issue in the design industry, with 77% of
designers reporting it as a growing problem, often leaving them with
wasted time and unanswered questions. Factors like a buyer's market,
shifting work patterns, and a decline in design's perceived value
contribute to this trend, making it both a commercial and emotional
challenge.
