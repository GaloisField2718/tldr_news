OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY ONE-MAN DESIGN SUBSCRIPTION AGENCIES ARE MEANT TO FAIL (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The trend of one-person design agencies is to offer unlimited
revisions for a fixed price - this has fundamental issues. The primary
challenges include time constraints, as one person needs to work on
managing extensive workloads and client demands efficiently. High
churn rates indicate clients leave once their projects are completed,
leading to instability and a need for constant new business. Unlimited
revisions can attract scope creep, degrading work quality due to
excessive demands.
