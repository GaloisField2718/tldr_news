OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN ARTIFACTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design artifacts should prioritize informing and improving product
design, with success measured by their impact rather than their
quality or quantity. The design field must focus on progress and
delivering great work rather than overemphasizing process and artifact
creation. 

 CONSISTENCY MEANS NOTHING (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Consistency is a spectrum influenced by context. It requires clear
definitions and shared understanding for effective collaboration.
Absolute consistency isn't always ideal - the right balance depends on
the situation and organizational needs. 

 I (STILL) DON'T KNOW WHAT “CRAFT” MEANS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Craft in design requires clear communication, thoughtful briefs, and
a focus on unique, graphical solutions rather than visual flair or
generic designs. Demonstrating craft involves presenting ideas
effectively and embracing creativity beyond standardized systems.

 OPENAI IS ADOBE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Adobe's dominance in creative industries is being challenged by
OpenAI's ChatGPT, which offers efficiency and idea generation. While
