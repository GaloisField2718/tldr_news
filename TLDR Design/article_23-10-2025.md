 GOOGLE MEET LAUNCHES AN AI-POWERED MAKEUP FEATURE (1 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Google Meet introduced an AI-powered makeup filter with 12 options
found in the "Appearance" section under "Portrait touch-up," competing
with similar features in Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The virtual makeup
stays in place regardless of on-screen movement, making it appear more
authentic, and can be activated before or during calls. The feature,
which rolled out on October 8 for mobile and web, remains disabled by
default and remembers user preferences for future meetings. 

 OPENAI HAS INTRODUCED CHATGPT ATLAS – A WEB BROWSER WITH A BUILT-IN
AI ASSISTANT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a web browser that integrates ChatGPT
directly into the experience, combining search, AI, and personal
context. Key features include memory to recall past interactions and
website context, and agent mode to perform tasks like placing orders
or preparing reports without leaving the page. It is now available on
macOS, with other platforms coming soon. 

 IPHONE AIR ORDERS SLASHED TO ALMOST ‘END OF PRODUCTION' LEVELS,
SAYS NIKKEI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly cutting iPhone Air production to near
end-of-production levels due to weak demand, while other models like
the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro are exceeding expectations. Analyst
data suggests that the iPhone Air is significantly less popular than
anticipated. Overall iPhone production remains in line with forecasts.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN ‘FOR' AI, INSTEAD OF ‘WITH' AI (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers should shift from using AI as a creative tool to designing
products specifically for AI agents to interact with. Traditional
design elements will become obsolete as AI agents act as proxies
between humans and digital services, requiring designers to understand
reasoning engines and create modular, voice-activated systems. Design
leaders must reimagine their entire practice around synthetic users,
moving away from conventional metrics and interfaces toward
trust-based, contextual experiences that accommodate AI's proactive,
non-linear decision-making processes. 

 THE ILLUSION OF ALIGNMENT (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The "illusion of alignment" occurs when teams use identical language
but imagine completely different solutions, leading to costly
miscommunication that only surfaces when designers finally present
their work. Designers can prevent this breakdown by sketching rough
visual interpretations early and often, which forces misaligned
assumptions to surface during strategy sessions, kickoffs, and
reviews, thereby avoiding wasted time and strained relationships.
Rather than waiting for a "seat at the table," designers should
leverage their natural visual thinking to create shared understanding
through simple drawings. 

 DESIGNERS NEED TO BE GENERALIZED SPECIALISTS NOWADAYS—HERE'S HOW AI
CAN HELP (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In the age of AI, the debate between generalist and specialist
designers misses the point: the most valuable designers are
“generalized specialists” who combine broad skills with deep
domain expertise. Generalists spot patterns and opportunities across
fields, while specialists optimize within a domain. Strategically
switching between these modes and applying AI thoughtfully allows
designers to tackle diverse challenges and remain indispensable in
smaller, stretched teams.

 ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designers often struggle to defend their work when stakeholders ask
tough questions, typically due to failing to adapt design processes to
specific projects, lacking data-driven evidence, avoiding regular
feedback, or using jargon instead of business language. The solution
involves documenting decisions throughout the process, gathering
relevant evidence, exposing work to frequent feedback, and connecting
design choices to business metrics and KPIs. Success requires
emotional detachment from one's work, strategic adaptation of design
methods rather than rigid process adherence, and communicating in
terms that resonate with the audience's priorities. 

 HOW DO GREAT DESIGN LEADERS APPROACH PROBLEMS? WITH STRATEGIC
CURIOSITY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Great design leaders systematically deploy curiosity as a strategic
tool by setting up brief, targeted conversations with stakeholders
across the organization to gather specific insights that help reframe
and position their work effectively. Personalized questions tailored
to different roles reveal crucial context, like how departments'
bonuses tie to specific outcomes. This structured method of strategic
curiosity, rather than unorganized relationship-building or
complaining, enables designers to understand business constraints,
justify resource needs, and ultimately advance both their projects and
careers.

flexibility, and the collaboration's focus on trust and clear
communication led to a widely praised, modernized brand system that
honors the company's legacy.
