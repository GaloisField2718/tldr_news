 THE CREATIVE COLD START PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers, artists, and businesses sometimes face a "creative cold
start problem" that blocks their first step. To overcome this, focus
on action over perfection, prototype, and experiment, use common
patterns, seek balanced feedback, and align personal excitement with
audience resonance. 

 AFFORDANCE IN DESIGN SYSTEM COMPONENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems built with proper affordances are the key to creating
intuitive and versatile user interfaces. Designers can ensure that
components are robust and flexible by clearly defining and
implementing boundaries around their intended uses. Collaborating with
product teams and applying data-informed design contributes to
quantifying the impact of design decisions.

fostering accessible interactions within a project. Instead of

 FAMILIAR VS NOVEL (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Familiar design boosts productivity by allowing users to transfer
their experience between similar products, while novel design helps
differentiate from competitors and adds elements of surprise.
Balancing novelty with familiarity, rooted in thorough user research
and testing, is crucial to meet user needs and preferences. 

 IMPACT OF TOKENS ON IMAGE GENERATION (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Removing or adding keywords in AI image prompts leads to
unpredictable changes, highlighting the current limitations in prompt
adherence. Experiments with Midjourney showed that while general
concepts were maintained, specifics often deviated based on the
prompt's length and detail. Iterative attempts and multiple trials
remain essential to achieving desired results in AI-generated images. 

 BUILDING YOUR DESIGN TRIBE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Building a design tribe can revolutionize your work environment by
fostering a strong support system where team members implicitly

cohesive and supportive tribe can transform your UX team's culture and
performance.
