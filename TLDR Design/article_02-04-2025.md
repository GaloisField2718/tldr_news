HEALTH SENSOR (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A leaked Apple Watch Series 10 prototype revealed a new sensor layout
with a mysterious "extra light ring," hinting at blood pressure and
glucose monitoring experiments. Though these features will be likely
delayed, the prototype, running on watchOS 11.1, suggests Apple is
still developing advanced health sensors for future models.

 Google Slides is enhancing its visual capabilities with Imagen 3 for
AI-generated images, a new design sidebar, additional templates,
building blocks, an expanded stock library, and proportional scaling.

 RUNWAY SAYS ITS LATEST AI VIDEO MODEL CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE
CONSISTENT SCENES AND PEOPLE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Runway has launched a new video tool, Gen-4, that helps creators keep
characters and scenes consistent across different shots. Users can
generate videos where people and settings stay the same from different
angles and in various lighting by using just one reference image and a
description. This update comes after last year's Gen-3 Alpha release,
which allowed for longer videos but drew criticism for how the
training data was collected.
