 INTERVIEW: FIGMA‚ÄôS CEO ON LIFE AFTER THE COMPANY‚ÄôS FAILED SALE TO
ADOBE (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma‚Äôs CEO Dylan Field will use the $1 billion cash from Adobe's
breakup fee to acquire tech companies. Figma was never meant to be
just a design tool. Field wants to explore the potential of generative
AI and the role it will increasingly play in the design process. 

 WHAT WAS SORA TRAINED ON? CREATIVES DEMAND ANSWERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 OpenAI's Sora is an impressive diffusion model that translates visual
data into "patches," or pieces, that the model can interpret and turn
into hyperrealistic videos. While the company states it draws
inspiration from large language models that acquire generalist
capabilities by training on internet-scale data, it doesn't mention
where the visual data came from. Many artists and creatives have
already expressed on social media that the model was trained based on
copyrighted data and will negatively impact their livelihoods. 

 INTRODUCING SPECTRUM 2: ADOBE‚ÄôS REVAMPED DESIGN SYSTEM (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Adobe has revamped its Spectrum design product design system,
establishing a consistent language and user experience. The company
recognized the evolving user landscape, technological advancements,
and the need for even greater cohesion across its products. Spectrum
2's preview images suggest enhanced visual hierarchy, brighter
aesthetics, rounded design elements, and improved readability.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE UX OF AI: LESSONS FROM PERPLEXITY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most of the widespread AI integration we‚Äôre seeing now lacks
creativity. Many companies rushed to cram AI chatbots into their
products as a quick, obvious way to integrate the new technology.
These chatbots can be helpful, but they are rarely the right solution.


 THE OPTIMAL USER ONBOARDING ZONE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A user‚Äôs ability to realize the most value out of a new product
(‚Äúperformance‚Äù) might be correlated to the amount of friction
(‚Äústress‚Äù) involved in onboarding to it. The optimal onboarding
experience can be represented as the peak of a bell curve graphed
along those two measures. If the onboarding experience is too passive,
or the new user is hand-held even through the most basic tasks, you
risk the user not realizing the personal value they could gain from
the experience - they will quickly lose interest. 

 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO HICK'S LAW IN UX (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 With the help of Hick's Law, you can present choices strategically to
users in a way that minimizes their cognitive load and effort, making
their experience more efficient and enjoyable. By understanding user
behavior and context within the interface, designers can reduce the
number of choices in a user interface, highlight key options, use
progressive disclosure, and simplify complex tasks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HTML.TO.DESIGN (WEBSITE) [11] 

 Leverage an existing website and import its HTML to Figma to start
your designs without building each element from scratch. It can also
be used to capture websites for a benchmark of moodboard in Figma. 

 RECRAFT (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Recraft is a generative AI design tool that lets users create and
edit digital illustrations, vector art, icons, and 3D graphics in a
uniform brand style. Designers can start with text or visual input,
select a style, and edit with repaint and lasso on an infinite canvas.


 PUBLISH YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM INSTANTLY, DIRECTLY FROM FIGMA (WEBSITE)
[13] 

 Turn any published Figma library into a fully and shareable
documented design system into a custom domain website.

 VIDEO GENERATION MODELS AS WORLD SIMULATORS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Video generation models could provide a promising way to build
general-purpose simulators of the physical world. OpenAI combined
text-conditional diffusion models with videos and images of varying
lengths, resolutions, and aspect ratios to generate its outputs to
create Sora. Based on a transformer architecture, Sora can create a
minute of high-fidelity video using spacetime patches of video and
image latent codes. 

 IBM EQUAL ACCESS: AUTOMATED ACCESSIBILITY TOOL REVIEW (11 MINUTE
READ) [15]

you quickly scan web pages for accessibility issues and create a
report of your accessibility audit. Combining its analysis with more
complex automated tools and manual testing provides a solid foundation
for tackling accessibility issues effectively. 

 BECOMING A DESIGN ENGINEER (4 MINUTE READ) [16]
