BLURRING (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe is bringing even more Firefly-powered artificial intelligence

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LOW FIDELITY DESIGN IS HIGHER UP THE VALUE CHAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 High-fidelity visuals don't create clarity. They hide the fact that
the work wasn't done, with details that are every bit as fake as the
sketch - but enough to satisfy stakeholders looking for an output. On
the other hand, low-fidelity artifacts don't leave anywhere for
ambiguity to hide. They are a fast way to call out all the questions
that we don't have answers to. 

 UI DENSITY (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UI density reflects the information an interface provides and is
shaped by design decisions. Visual density is the initial impression
based on screen elements. Information density is the ratio of useful
data to total ink. Both visual and design density are influenced by
Gestalt principles and affect user perception in UI design. 

 OPTIMIZING FORM DESIGN: MARKING REQUIRED AND OPTIONAL FIELDS IN A
BETTER WAY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designing clear and user-friendly forms is crucial for usability.
This article discusses various methods for marking required and
optional fields, such as using asterisks or labels for optional
fields. Conducting user testing is recommended for determining the
best approach as it ensures higher conversion rates and satisfied
users.

 IT'S TIME WE SERIOUSLY TALK ABOUT USERS AND EXPERIENCES (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Knowing actual users' names, experiences, and daily challenges is
essential to designing genuinely user-centered products. Without this
focus, UX efforts can become misaligned, resulting in products that
lack direction and fail to provide users value. Teams should move
beyond generic personas and truly understand their users' unique needs
and experiences. 

 HIDDEN VS. DISABLED IN UX (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Both hiding and disabling features in UX can confuse users, so they
should be done sparingly and with clear reasoning. Disabled features
indicate availability but inaccessibility, while hidden features
indicate current irrelevance. Alternatives like enabled buttons,
read-only states, and better empty states should be considered to
maintain user understanding and interface clarity. 

 WHY NOT SKETCH? (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sketching has immense value in various activities beyond traditional
artistry, such as planning and problem-solving. Despite its benefits,
many people refrain from sketching due to early discouragement, lack
of practice, or personal discomfort. Embracing sketching can bring
about more creativity and communication, regardless of artistic
background.
