 OPENAI IS ADDING NEW WATERMARKS TO DALL-E 3 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Images generated by OpenAI‚Äôs DALL-E 3 will now incorporate a
visible CR symbol watermark and invisible metadata. This move aims to
identify the origin of AI-generated content, although the watermarks
will only apply to still images. OpenAI asserts that this
implementation will have minimal impact on latency and image quality,
but acknowledges that the watermarks may be easily removed. The move
emphasizes the importance of recognizing provenance signals to enhance
digital information trustworthiness.

MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers and researchers trying to convince their companies to

written descriptions of images you want to protect.

 In the dynamic world of product design, principles are the guiding
stars that navigate the journey from a concept to a tangible reality.

WORSE (6 MINUTE READ) [16]
