Extended collections for multi-brand management and Slots for
customizable components launching in November. The Figma MCP server

 ADOBE UNVEILS FIREFLY 5 WITH PHOTOREALISTIC IMAGES AND LAYERED
PROMPT-BASED EDITING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe launched Firefly 5, its latest AI image generation model,
featuring native 4MP resolution, enhanced human rendering, and new
prompt-based layered editing capabilities that let creators modify
specific elements without regenerating entire images. The company is
also expanding Firefly to include third-party models from partners
like Topaz and ElevenLabs, while making Firefly Custom Models
available to all creators through a private beta waitlist. These
announcements were made at Adobe Max 2025, where the company
emphasized commercially safe AI tools designed to enhance creative
productivity across images, video, and audio. 

 GRAMMARLY REBRANDS TO ‘SUPERHUMAN,' LAUNCHES A NEW AI ASSISTANT (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Grammarly has rebranded as “Superhuman” following its July
acquisition of the email client by the same name. It will keep the
Grammarly product name intact for now. Alongside the rebrand, the
company has launched an AI assistant called Superhuman Go, which
integrates with tools like Gmail, Google Drive, and Jira to offer
writing help and perform productivity tasks.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY STEALING DESIGN WORKS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perplexity's AI browser Comet succeeded by deliberately copying
Chrome's familiar interface rather than innovating with radical new
designs like Arc and Dia, which struggled with user adoption. The
strategy follows Jakob's Law (users prefer products that work like
ones they already know), allowing people to switch browsers without
learning new interactions while quietly integrating AI features.
Instead of pursuing original design for novelty's sake, Comet
prioritized invisible ease and useful functionality, proving that
copying familiar patterns and then innovating subtly often beats
flashy redesigns that create friction. 

 ADOBE PUTS AI IN EVERYTHING, EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 At Adobe Max 2025, Adobe announced it's opening its Creative Cloud
apps—like Photoshop and Premiere Pro—to third-party AI models,
including Google's, emphasizing “choice” over exclusivity to
Firefly. The company also unveiled new AI video, music, and voice
tools, chat-based assistants, and tighter YouTube Shorts integration,
aiming to keep creators inside Adobe's ecosystem as AI reshapes
creative work. 

 AS AI BECOMES AGI, DESIGN HAS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Human-level AI could arrive within the next decade, potentially
displacing billions of workers and triggering global economic and
social disruption. Designers and strategists should act now by
influencing policy, promoting preparedness, and shaping a future that
safeguards human dignity, purpose, and social stability.

 TACKLING COMMON UX HURDLES WITH AI (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI capabilities enable solutions to longstanding UX problems by
leveraging models' strengths rather than just adding chat interfaces
to existing applications. Instead of empty states and tutorials, AI
can generate working content that immediately engages users and
supports learning through editing. Natural language understanding
enables conversational search to replace complex filtering systems,
while AI's ability to process unstructured inputs, such as images or
PDFs, eliminates traditional form-filling requirements by
automatically extracting and structuring data. 

 DESIGNING SOFTWARE FOR THINGS THAT ROT (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fermento is a fermentation-tracking app that applies HACCP (Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Points) food safety frameworks to home
fermentation projects, treating the process as monitored
infrastructure rather than simple cooking. The app uses phase-based
state machines to evaluate measurements such as pH and humidity
against context-specific constraints, automatically flagging
deviations and generating compliance documentation for high-risk
ferments like cured meats while remaining useful as a simple diary for
forgiving projects like sauerkraut. Unlike typical software optimized
for uptime and consistency, the system is designed around controlled
drift and variance, tracking trends over time to help fermenters
distinguish between harmless fluctuations and dangerous deviations. 

 HOW DESIGN LEADERS WIN OVER ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T TRUST UX (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When joining a company that's lost faith in UX, the challenge isn't
fixing bad design—it's rebuilding broken trust. To restore
credibility, designers must understand why stakeholders became
disillusioned, align UX work with business goals, deliver consistent
small wins, and communicate impact in terms of value—like revenue or
efficiency—rather than design metrics.
