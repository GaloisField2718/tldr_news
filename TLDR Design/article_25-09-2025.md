 GOOGLE INTRODUCES MIXBOARD – AN AI-POWERED TOOL FOR VISUAL
CONCEPTING (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google Labs' Mixboard is an AI-powered design board tool that lets
users generate, edit, and organize visual collections from text
prompts, templates, or uploaded images, resembling tools like FigJam.

READ) [5] 

 Figma expanded its Model Context Protocol server to support the Figma
Make AI app builder, enabling AI models to access the underlying code,
in addition to visual designs. The MCP server now supports remote
access from various AI coding platforms, including Anthropic, Cursor,
and VS Code, making it more accessible to developers. Additional
features, such as Design Snapshot for converting Make files into
editable layers and AI prompt-based editing within the Design tool,
are coming soon.

 SNOWBALL KILLED THE DEV-STAR: STOP HANDING OFF, START SUCCEEDING IN
THE AI-FIRST WORLD (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional 3-in-a-box development models fail in AI-first products
because AI behavior is probabilistic and emergent, making sequential
handoffs between PMs, developers, and UX designers ineffective and
prone to distortion. The "Snowball" approach advocates for
cross-functional teams that collaborate continuously, starting with
data and live prototypes rather than static wireframes to validate AI
concepts with real users. UX designers must evolve beyond Figma
mockups to embrace "vibe coding" and work directly with AI tools, or
risk becoming obsolete in an era where successful AI products require
integrated teamwork from day one. 

 YOUR UX DESIGN EDC (EVERY DAY CARRY) (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Five essential UX design frameworks help designers move beyond
intuition to strategic problem-solving: the Elements of UX for
diagnosing issues across five interdependent layers, Laws of UX for
evidence-based decisions using psychological principles, Morville's
Honeycomb for defining user value, Object-Oriented UX helps organize
complex digital systems, and the Business Model Canvas connects design
decisions to business outcomes. These frameworks collectively
transform designers from "pixel-pushers" into strategic partners who
can confidently defend their work and influence product direction. 

 WHY SPOTIFY HIRED A DEDICATED TYPOGRAPHER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In this post, Spotify's staff typographer, Bianca Berning, shares how
she moved from graphic design into type design, her role in shaping
Spotify's cross-platform typography, and the importance of custom
fonts for cultural relevance across 74 languages. She highlights how
Spotify treats typography as core (not a side project) and how AI
helps streamline tedious processes like font updates. Berning advises
aspiring type designers to seek inspiration beyond the screen and into
the wider world.

 THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON IN A FREELANCER'S TOOLKIT ISN'T TALENT. IT'S
COMMUNICATION (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Communication stands as the most crucial skill for freelance success,

expectations, and respect client timelines retain clients for decades,
while those who leave clients guessing quickly lose business. Simple
systems for regular updates and acknowledgment of client
communications build trust and transform one-time projects into
lasting professional partnerships.
