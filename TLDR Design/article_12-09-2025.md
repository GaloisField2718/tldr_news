 TIM COOK AND OTHER APPLE EXECS TALK IPHONE AIR'S DESIGN VISION IN NEW
WSJ INTERVIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The iPhone Air emphasizes thinness, lightness, and a polished,
reflective design aimed at style over utility, contrasting with the
sturdier Pro models. Apple executives acknowledged that users will
face a tough choice between Air and Pro, hinted at secrecy around
future foldables, and highlighted personalization features like the
crossbody strap as central to the Air's identity. 

 HEINZ JUST WON THE LOGO-LESS ADVERT TREND (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Heinz's new “Looks Familiar” campaign uses a minimalist, playful
approach to highlight how perfectly its ketchup pairs with French
fries. The ads replace the Heinz logo with a French fry box, relying
only on silhouette and typography to trigger instant brand
recognition. This bold move reflects Heinz's confidence in its iconic
design and taps into a growing advertising trend of dropping logos to
create an interactive “guess-who” experience. By keeping things
simple yet clever, Heinz reinforces its branding while refreshing how
consumers engage with familiar products. 

 ADOBE'S FIRST AI AGENTS ARE READY TO ROCK AND ROLL (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Adobe launched its first family of AI agents for the Adobe Experience
Platform. Designed to automate marketing tasks like audience building,
customer journey creation, and website optimization, the agents work
alongside the new AEP Agent Orchestrator, which manages both Adobe's
native agents and third-party solutions through natural language
prompts while keeping humans involved in the process. Adobe plans to
expand capabilities with the upcoming Experience Platform Agent
Composer, allowing companies to customize agents according to their
specific brand guidelines and policies.

 AMID THIS TERRIFYING CLIMATE CRISIS, DESIGNERS NEED TO STEP UP (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 At the World Design Congress in London, architect Indy Johar warned
that climate change will radically reshape society, from
infrastructure to inequality, and urged designers to confront this
reality with radical new ideas. Speakers, including Johar, Leland
Maschmeyer, Sarah McCullough, and others, argued that design must move
beyond aesthetics to rewire society's desires, create joy in
sustainability, and embrace responsibility for shaping a livable
future, because, as Tori Tsui reminded, the world is at the mercy of
designers' imagination. 

 PICASSO'S BULL: THE ART OF EARNING SIMPLICITY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Picasso's "Le Taureau" lithograph series demonstrates how creative
mastery requires earning simplicity through iterative complexity,
starting with detailed, realistic drawings and systematically reducing
them to essential flowing lines. The eleven drawings from 1945 to 1946
reveal that elegant final abstractions are only possible after working
through the full complexity of earlier iterations. Modern AI tools can
disrupt this essential creative process by either making creators skip
the raw material stage or overwhelming them with generated content
before thoughtful reduction occurs. 

 WHAT CAN YOU DO IF YOUR BOSS STARTS GENERATING AI DESIGNS? (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Design teams face challenges when colleagues use AI tools to bypass
UX processes, creating appealing but functionally flawed designs that
may seem faster initially. Designers must shift from emphasizing speed
advantages to communicating broader business value, translating design
problems into terms stakeholders understand, like engineering rework
costs and security risks. Building trust requires understanding what
motivates teams to use AI shortcuts and demonstrating how proper UX
prevents costly mistakes that damage user experience and business
objectives.

 AUDITING YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM FOR ACCESSIBILITY (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Accessibility must be built into Design Systems from the start, since
flaws at the system level ripple across every product and compound
over time. A structured audit of tokens, components, and patterns that
prioritizes fixes by severity and effort would ensure a stable,
inclusive foundation that reduces downstream issues and supports
accessible, consistent design. 

 HOW TO HARNESS SKILLS THAT AI CAN'T AUTOMATE (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI tools can quickly generate functional prototypes, but exceptional
products require distinctly human skills like curiosity, intuition,
taste, and intention that AI cannot replicate. While AI accelerates
exploration and iteration, humans provide the emotional intelligence
to sense what resonates with users and the discernment to refine ideas
into meaningful experiences. Design systems become crucial frameworks
that help teams maintain quality and consistency when leveraging AI,
ensuring outputs align with brand identity and user needs.

colored tabletop accessories, including meatball trays, bouncy vases,
and donut-shaped lamps. Westman's approach prioritizes fun over
seriousness, creating what Ikea calls "humorous objects" that serve
joy in an industry often focused on rigour and restraint.
