NEWS & TRENDS

 CHATGPT GO IS NOW AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE, BUT FREE AND GO USERS WILL
SOON SEE ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has expanded ChatGPT Go, its $8/month subscription tier, to
worldwide availability and announced plans to introduce ads for free
and Go users starting in the US. Ads will appear at the bottom of
responses for relevant products or services, with exceptions for
sensitive topics like health and politics. ChatGPT Plus, Pro,
Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will remain ad-free, with Plus
offering advanced features at $20/month. 

 MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY TRADEMARKS HIMSELF TO FIGHT AI MISUSE (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Matthew McConaughey has secured eight trademarks from the US Patent
and Trademark Office covering his voice and likeness, including video
clips and audio of his famous "Alright, alright, alright" line. The
trademarks are designed to prevent AI applications and users from
creating unauthorized simulations of his voice or appearance.
McConaughey stated he wants to establish clear ownership boundaries
requiring consent and attribution in an AI-driven world. 

 IPHONE 18 PRO SELFIE CAMERA AND DYNAMIC ISLAND MAY BE POSITIONED ON
THE LEFT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reports suggest the iPhone 18 Pro may switch to a punch-hole selfie
camera with Face ID hidden under the display, possibly moving the
camera from the center to the top-left corner. This would likely shift
the Dynamic Island left as well—since it's considered too useful to
drop—and it could still look balanced if it spans the full screen
width.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT RUNNING UX AUDITS (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A UX specialist with two years of auditing experience for global
brands shares comprehensive lessons on conducting UX audits. They
cover key lessons, including recognizing when audits apply,
communicating effectively with stakeholders, grounding recommendations
in data, and selecting appropriate research tools while remaining
tool-agnostic. Additional guidance includes systematically examining
elements from usability to conversion optimization, delivering
findings through clear visual presentations scheduled strategically
after report delivery, and avoiding common pitfalls. 

 APPLE'S DESIGN PHILOSOPHY AND THE ROLE OF A UI/UX DESIGN AGENCY IN
PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product-market fit requires deep user understanding and continuous
iteration rather than assumptions. UI/UX design agencies bridge the
gap between business goals and user behavior through structured
research, usability testing, and pattern identification that reveals
friction points. These agencies enable ongoing refinement by
translating inconsistent user feedback into actionable insights,
helping teams adapt as markets and expectations evolve. 

 WHEN TOOLS PRETEND TO BE PEOPLE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI interfaces are deliberately designed to feel human—using
conversation, memory, first-person language, and emotional
tone—which encourages people to treat tools like thinking agents and
outsource judgment to them. This blurring of boundaries leads to
over-trust, dependency, and real harm. Designers should make limits
visible by removing human-like cues, showing uncertainty, breaking
false intimacy, and clearly framing outputs as generated text, not
authority.

 Honda has officially confirmed its new, flatter “H” logo will
roll out on EV models launching from 2027 onward. Replacing the old
