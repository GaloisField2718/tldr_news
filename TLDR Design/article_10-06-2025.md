 THE SWITCH 2'S MOST UNEXPECTEDLY SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE IS THE ESHOP
DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nintendo Switch 2's eShop received major performance and design
upgrades that surprised fans with their significance. The new digital
storefront runs much faster than its sluggish predecessor, eliminating
the painful lag that plagued game browsing. Design improvements
include better categories, filters, personalized discovery features,
and Nintendo's signature red branding, replacing the previous orange
color scheme. Social media users are celebrating the smoother
experience, with some calling it a "real store" complete with
auto-playing trailers and improved navigation. 

 THE FOUNDER OF DEVIANTART IS MAKING A $22,000 DISPLAY FOR DIGITAL ART
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeviantArt founder Angelo Sotira has launched Layer, a $22,000
premium display designed to showcase digital art. The high-end screen
focuses on code-based generative artworks that require significant
computing power to render live animations and interactive pieces.
Layer operates as a self-sustaining system that automatically
sequences art collections, requiring minimal user maintenance over its
intended five-year lifespan. The startup raised $5.7 million in
funding and operates on a subscription model where artists receive
royalties based on the display time of their works.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AN EMPATHETIC DESIGNER (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Empathy remains crucial for design work, extending beyond user
understanding to internal processes and stakeholder management. It can
be as simple as making workflow changes, such as creating a simplified
Figma component library for non-designers and anticipating their needs
through detailed documentation, tutorials, and support channels. Deep
user research through shadowing, active listening, and building trust
with internal platform users can reveal insights impossible to gather
through traditional interviews alone. 

 THE POLITICS OF DESIGN SYSTEMS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Building a great design system isn't enough — people won't adopt it
just because it exists, they'll only embrace it if they feel included,
understood, and see clear value in it for their work. True adoption is
built on trust and relationships, not mandates or documentation, and
success comes when the system becomes theirs, not just yours. 

 AWARDS ARE A PROBLEM – DESIGN IS CLAPPING ITSELF INTO THE ABYSS (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 At a time of seismic cultural and technological change, the creative
industry continues to cling to outdated awards rituals that feel
increasingly disconnected from the real challenges and opportunities
ahead. Instead of celebrating shallow recognition, we should be
empowering work that defines new creative standards and leads the
future with vision, relevance, and impact.

 MORE ON WHAT MAKES A GOOD ACCESSIBILITY DESIGNER (6 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Accessibility design requires centering disabled people as
collaborators rather than subjects, shifting from compliance-focused
approaches to experience-driven design that prioritizes actual
usability over meeting standards. Designers must learn HTML to
understand how their work translates into accessible code and
communicate effectively with development teams about accessibility
impacts. The work is inherently political, as it involves civil rights
and social justice, requiring designers to navigate complex systems,
including ableism, capitalism, and power structures, while developing
strategies to parse feedback constructively. 

 WHAT IS PHYGITAL DESIGN, AND WHY IS IT EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW? (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Phygital design — the blend of physical and digital experiences —
is transforming how brands engage consumers, turning everyday objects
like packaging into interactive, immersive touchpoints without the
need for apps. Once a marketing buzzword, it has become a strategic
necessity driven by technological advancements, hybrid lifestyles, and
new EU legislation that demands more accessible, transparent, and
engaging product interactions.
