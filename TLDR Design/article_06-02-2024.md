 DESIGNER NEWS IS DEAD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Designer News, once a prominent hub for product designers, has
officially shut down, marking the end of its unique, text-focused
discussions on nuanced aspects of product design. Initially thriving
and exclusive, the platform deteriorated after opening registration to
everyone, leading to a decline in post quality and an influx of spam. 

 TESLA‚ÄôS CARS JUST GOT ‚ÄòRECALLED‚Äô OVER A FONT (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A recent recall from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) on Tesla cars was prompted by a very peculiar
reason: the font on the touchscreen display is too small. The NHTSA
says people might have trouble seeing the ‚Öõ-inch warning sign for
the automaker's brake system. It claims that the international
standard for that text is 3.2 millimeters and anything less may pose a
safety risk. The issue, which affects 2.2 million cars, can be fixed
with a simple software update.

 THE PROBLEM WITH DIGITAL INSTRUMENT CLUSTERS AND HOW TO DESIGN A
BETTER ONE (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most new cars today have digital instrument clusters without physical
constraints, which should be a benefit, but most carmakers use it to
add unnecessary complexity. Clusters should adapt to different
contexts, for example, they should be simple and controlled by the
driver when driving at night.

 VISION PRO TEARDOWN‚ÄîWHY THOSE FAKE EYES LOOK SO WEIRD (16 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Apple wanted to achieve something particular when it designed the
EyeSight feature for its Vision Pro: an animated, 3D-looking face with
eyes. It had to make very strategic design choices and compromises to
accomplish this. Yet, the result is a slightly creepy animation that
requires another screen, more connectors, and points of failure. 

 ART OF SYMBOLS (WEBSITE) [14] 

 Symbols are integral to our design vocabulary, so we must know where
they come from and what they mean. This website teaches you about the
meaning of many symbols over the past 40,000 years and how they were
used throughout human history.

 WHY GOOD UX IS NO UX (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The evolution of car keys, from basic mechanical devices to
sophisticated, app-based systems, mirrors the progression towards more

technology feel like a natural extension of our routines. 

 USING AI FOR 3D RENDERING‚ÄîA PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR DESIGNERS (11
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The slow, meticulous process of creating high-quality renders is
often incompatible with the fast pace required from early concept
ideation. On the other hand, the ease of iterating with AI-generated
images is unmatched - even a slight tweak in a prompt can lead to a
significant shift in visual style.
