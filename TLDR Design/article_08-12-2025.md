NEWS & TRENDS

 PANTONE CROWNS 'CLOUD DANCER' AS ITS COLOUR OF THE YEAR 2026,
INVITING CREATIVES TO BREATHE AGAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cloud Dancer, Pantone's 2026 Colour of the Year, is a soft white
meant to act as a calming pause in an overstimulated world,
symbolising clarity, renewal, and a return to simplicity. Its launch
comes with artist collaborations and wide adoption across tech,
fashion, interiors, and lifestyle brands, positioning the shade as a
versatile, grounding base for creativity in a year when many people
are craving mental space and a fresh start. 

 SEVEN WAYS WE'RE MAKING ANDROID MORE ACCESSIBLE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Android is rolling out new accessibility features, including an
expanded dark theme option that automatically darkens apps without
native dark mode support, and emotion tags in Expressive Captions that
detect feelings like joy or sadness in audio content. Voice Access can
now be launched hands-free through Gemini. Additional updates include
improved AutoClick mouse controls, easier TalkBack voice dictation,
Gemini-powered Guided Frame for camera assistance, and Fast Pair
support for hearing aids. 

 SKETCH HAS INTRODUCED A MAJOR COPENHAGEN UPDATE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sketch's new Copenhagen update delivers the biggest interface
overhaul in years. It replaces floating panels with a fixed sidebar,
reorganizes navigation, and introduces a redesigned Layers panel with
a helpful Focus mode for complex files. With an adaptive toolbar and
improved Inspector panels, the update makes the app feel cleaner, more
intuitive, and noticeably more efficient for everyday design work.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN DOGMA YOU MUST UNLEARN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers must abandon self-limiting dogmas, including the belief
that complaints alone drive change, the expectation that others should
automatically accommodate design perspectives, and the outrage over
the prevalence of bad design. Bad design is common because good design
requires more resources, and designers' minority status means they
must guide non-designers rather than demand accommodation. 

 JAGUAR'S DESIGN CRISIS JUST WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Jaguar's deeply divisive 2024 rebrand is still echoing through the
company. The turmoil has culminated in the sudden removal of chief
creative officer Gerry McGovern. Following declining sales, the
dismissal of the ad agency behind the rebrand, and harsh criticism of
McGovern's Type 00 concept EV, his departure strongly suggests that
Jaguar's new leadership is losing confidence in the bold design
direction introduced last year and may be preparing to pivot away from
it. 

 ELIZABETH GOODSPEED ON HOW MANY DESIGNERS IT TAKES TO MAKE A STUDIO
(7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many independent designers operate as formal “studios” even when
solo, partly for legal and financial benefits, but also to signal
professionalism, authority, and room for growth. However, naming a
practice—after oneself or as a separate studio—carries nuanced
implications for perception, gender dynamics, client expectations, and
creative freedom. Some designers choose to be transparent about their
small or solo status to maintain nimbleness, personal connection, and
control over how their work is credited and experienced. 

 MAYBE A DESIGN BLOW-UP IS JUST WHAT APPLE NEEDED (5 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Apple's design division faces a long-needed reset with Alan Dye's
departure. Years of talent loss, drift between hardware and software
teams, and uneven leadership have eroded the company's once-formidable
design culture. Stephen Lemay—an experienced but low-profile Apple
veteran—has the rare opportunity to rebuild the organization from
the ground up, though bold changes aren't expected anytime soon.

 CAN YOU MAKE TOAST MESSAGES ACCESSIBLE? (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub's design system banned toast messages because they create
accessibility and usability problems that can't be fixed with
technical solutions. Toast messages disappear automatically after a
few seconds, obscure underlying content, and are difficult to spot at
the edges of the screen. GitHub's usability testing with disabled
users showed that fixing these core issues requires changing the
pattern so fundamentally that it would no longer qualify as a toast
message. 

 STOP DESIGNING ON AUTOPILOT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Designers plateau when unconscious habits and familiar solutions
replace intentional problem-solving, leading them to design for their
internal system rather than the project's actual needs. Growth
requires pausing automatic responses, asking whether choices fit the
project or merely feel comfortable, and exploring alternatives before
committing. The gap between technical skill and world-class work
closes when designers resist routine's gravitational pull and treat
each project as an opportunity to stretch beyond established patterns.
