 THE CASE AGAINST CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Conversational interfaces like voice assistants and chatbots aren't
the future of human-computer interaction, as natural language creates
a data transfer bottleneck. More intuitive and direct methods, similar
to gestures or shortcuts, are encouraged for efficient and effortless
communication with computers. 

 DON'T LET THE DRAWINGS DISTRACT YOU: AI IS NOT ABOUT THE OUTPUT (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI's real value lies beyond flashy outputs like art or essays. It can
optimize business decisions by processing unstructured information
flows. AI enables better decision-making and scalability by enhancing
how organizations capture, share, and interpret information.
Businesses should use AI to augment expertise, not just generate
content. 

 PROTOTYPING EVERYTHING (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 More than just a design step, prototyping is a mindset of exploration
and learning. In this post, Charlota Blunarova demonstrates how
prototypes can test ideas, spark feedback, and shape life decisions.
She highlights how low-fidelity tools and curiosity help guide choices
before committing to a final version, from cardboard artifacts to
AI-assisted brand sprints.

 AI is transforming UX, making UI less relevant and challenging
designers to shift beyond visual tools like Figma. AI-driven workflows

modern designers. 

 BROWSER CHOICE IS AN ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATION (6 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Blocking Chromium browsers can create accessibility barriers and
