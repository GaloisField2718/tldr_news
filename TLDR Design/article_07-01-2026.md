 GOOGLE IS WORKING ON NANO BANANA 2 FLASH TO GENERATE IMAGES AT
LIGHTNING SPEED (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google is developing Nano Banana 2 Flash, a slightly less powerful
model than Nano Banana Pro that generates realistic images at
lightning speed. The new tool is based on Gemini 3 Flash rather than
Gemini 3 Pro. The live version is likely to launch before the end of
the quarter due to fierce competition in the segment. 

 THIS IS LIKELY THE IPHONE FOLD DISPLAY, AND IT LOOKS AMAZING (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Samsung has unveiled a prototype folding display with an almost
completely invisible crease, widely believed to be the panel Apple has
been waiting for to use in the iPhone Fold after years of rejecting
visibly creased screens. Shown briefly at CES and quickly removed, the
display appears far more advanced than current Galaxy Fold panels and
matches the rumored iPhone Fold aspect ratio, suggesting that Samsung
has finally met Apple's stringent requirements for a creaseless
folding screen. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES A2UI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's A2UI (Agent-to-User Interface) is an open-source
specification that allows AI agents to generate rich, interactive,
native user interfaces by sending declarative UI descriptions instead
of executable code. It enables host applications to render components
securely and consistently across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.
By separating UI generation from UI rendering, A2UI improves security
and preserves design control for host apps. It supports dynamic
task-specific layouts. The specification marks a shift from text-based
AI interactions toward more interactive, context-aware agent
experiences.

 THE CHANGING PATTERN OF BRAND GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern brands like Uniqlo, Stanley, Human Made, and OpenAI are
growing through product-led experiences rather than traditional
emotional storytelling. This pattern contradicts conventional
brand-building wisdom that prioritizes awareness campaigns and the
marketing funnel. An upcoming book, "Brand Shift," explores this
paradigm change through key shifts in how brands accumulate trust,
tracing how technology has transformed the relationship between people
and brands from passive consumption to active connection. 

 DESIGN COURSES ARE FAILING EVERYONE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Harriet Richardson stopped guest lecturing on UK design courses
because universities have become financially dependent on overseas
students, prioritizing volume over viable learning conditions and
creating environments where language barriers, oversized cohorts, and
overstretched staff undermine critique-led education. She argues the
problem is systemic rather than student-led, calling for more honest
pathways that separate language learning from full degree programmes,
fairer working conditions for educators, and course structures that
genuinely support meaningful dialogue, learning, and exchange.

 HOW THE TOOLS WE USE CHANGE THE PRODUCTS WE DESIGN (9 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Web design tools have evolved from distinct eras—from plain HTML
and WYSIWYG editors, to Photoshop/Illustrator's static designs, and
finally, to purpose-built tools like Sketch and Figma. Each generation
of tools directly shaped what designers created, influencing
everything from visual aesthetics to functionality. Early sites
featured repeating backgrounds and GIFs, while modern designs favor
flat, reusable templates. The tools constrained and enabled design
choices, proving that "the medium is the message" applies profoundly
to web design's technological evolution. 

 IT'S HARD TO JUSTIFY TAHOE ICONS (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 macOS Tahoe's addition of icons to every menu item violates
fundamental interface design principles established decades ago,
creating cluttered menus where nothing stands out, and users can't
scan efficiently. The icons suffer from severe inconsistency within
and across apps. Apple's implementation ignores critical design
guidelines about pixel-grid alignment, appropriate metaphors, and
differentiating icons from text. 

 YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT GOOD DESIGN IN EVERY DRAWER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Younger generations are reshaping home life as a flexible, expressive
space shaped by tight budgets, hybrid living, and constant change,
where everyday objects must work reliably while also offering
emotional support and identity. As permanence becomes rare and life
increasingly happens at home, design is expected to be adaptable,
durable, and reassuring, turning humble homeware into tools that
ground shifting lives, express personality, and help people feel in
control amid uncertainty.
