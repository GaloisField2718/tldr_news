NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA NOW SUPPORTS BACKEND INTEGRATION WITH SUPABASE (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Supabase has launched a new integration with Figma Make that allows
users to build fully functional web applications with backend
capabilities directly within Figma. The integration provides
authentication, database storage, API access, and secret management
features for creating real web apps. Users can connect through AI chat
or file settings, with all projects and secrets managed via the
Supabase dashboard. The feature is available in open beta to all Figma
Make users. 

 DISCORD'S VIRTUAL REWARD, ‘ORBS,' LAUNCHES OUT OF BETA (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Discord has launched a virtual reward system called Orbs to the
public after a seven-week beta period. The system, which allows users
to earn rewards by completing ad-interaction Quests, generated
millions of earned and spent Orbs during testing, resulting in a
16-fold increase in first-time purchases in the Shop, with 79% of
participants having never made a purchase before. Discord is
positioning Orbs as a scalable advertising model for potential IPO
partners while potentially attracting non-subscribers to try Nitro
services. 

 XAI IS HIRING AN ENGINEER TO MAKE ANIME GIRLS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk's xAI has begun hiring for a “Fullstack Engineer –
Waifus” role, focused on developing AI-powered anime companions like
the goth waifu Ani and the violent red panda Bad Rudy. This effort is
part of xAI's broader mission to build AI systems that deeply
understand the universe—though in this case, that understanding
extends to designing virtual girlfriends. While the company has many
open roles, the move suggests xAI plans to expand its roster of
emotionally engaging AI characters.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE IMPORTANCE OF ICONOGRAPHY IN UI DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Icons serve as crucial visual communication tools in UI design,
guiding users through interfaces while supporting accessibility and
expressing brand identity. Effective iconography requires clarity,
simplicity, and consistency to ensure users can quickly understand
functions without relying on text explanations. Common pitfalls
include ambiguous symbols, inconsistent design systems, and excessive
detail that hinders scalability across different screen sizes. 

 COMMON DESIGN SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION MISTAKES (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design system documentation often fails due to poor organization,
outdated content, unclear language, missing examples, and insufficient
developer/accessibility guidelines. These issues lead to wasted time,
inconsistent implementations, and fragmented user experiences across
teams. Strong documentation requires a centralized structure, regular
updates, standardized terminology, practical examples with code
snippets, and comprehensive technical specifications, including
accessibility standards. 

 AI IS KILLING MUSIC, AND DESIGN CAN'T BE FAR BEHIND (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 An AI-generated band called “The Velvet Sundown” fooled over a
million Spotify listeners with its nostalgic '70s-rock sound, complete
with fake backstories and imagery, sparking unease about the future of
creative authenticity. The incident highlights a broader disruption
across the creative industries, where AI's rapid rise is not only
changing how content is made and consumed, but also challenging the
very value of human creativity in music, design, and beyond.

 WHY ARE BRANDING STUDIOS STARTING THEIR OWN TYPE FOUNDRIES? (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Design agencies are launching their type foundries to meet the
growing demand from clients for bespoke typefaces that enhance brand
differentiation. Studios like D8's abcD8, Jessica Walsh's Type of
Feeling, and Applied Systems Design Studio believe their branding
expertise positions them better than traditional foundries for
creating brand-specific typography. Some new foundries are simplifying
licensing by offering one-off fees instead of complex traditional
agreements, though whether this business model will prove sustainable
remains uncertain. 

 IMPROVING DESIGN CRITIQUES (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Design critique is often misunderstood or misused across design
teams, leading to confusion, misaligned expectations, and ineffective
feedback. To fix this, teams should clearly distinguish between four
types of feedback meetings—Design Critique, Design Review, Quality
Review, and Design Shareout—each with its own purpose, participants,
feedback type, and expectations, which helps improve design quality,
alignment, and overall collaboration.
