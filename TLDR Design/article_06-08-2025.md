 GROK IMAGINE, XAI'S NEW AI IMAGE AND VIDEO GENERATOR, LETS YOU MAKE
NSFW CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 xAI has rolled out Grok Imagine, an AI image and video generator with
NSFW "spicy mode," to premium X subscribers on iOS. The tool generates
15-second videos from text prompts but moderates explicit content and
restricts celebrity imagery like pregnant Trump. While competing with
established AI generators, Grok Imagine's human renderings still
appear waxy and cartoonish in quality.

 Apple's promised AI-powered Siri upgrade for the iPhone 16 is still
missing nearly a year later, leading to delays, ad removals, and
public criticism, even from within the company. Google mocked Apple's
failure in a new Pixel 10 ad, highlighting the delay just as leaks and
official teasers build anticipation for its own upcoming device
launch.

events, Genie 3 is currently available only as a limited research
preview for selected academics and creators.

 WHAT'S NEXT FOR DESIGN TOOLS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Following Figma's July 2025 IPO, the author explores how design tools
will evolve in the AI era. Design commoditization democratizes access
and elevates quality expectations, making brand and taste key
differentiators. Future design workflows will emphasize variant
generation, code integration, and "Bring Your Own Tools"
interoperability. 

 THE AGE OF THE SUPER IC (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Leading AI companies now prioritize exceptional individual
contributors over managers, disrupting the traditional
designer-to-management career path. AI consolidates work that
previously required full teams back to talented individuals,
flattening hierarchies and reducing management layers. Senior
designers face a crucial decision point to embrace craft-focused IC
roles before this career window closes. 

 BEFORE YOU CHOOSE A DEFAULT SANS, CHECK OUT RAZZIATYPE'S NUANCED RT
LATELY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 RT Lately is a contemporary typeface born from a study of historical
gothic styles like Times Gothic and Franklin Gothic, blending raw,
clumsy charm with refined design principles. Designed by Schiavone, it
balances quirky personality with technical precision, offering
generous proportions, smooth join treatments, dynamic contrast
handling, and stylistic alternates, resulting in a versatile and
character-rich sans serif suited for modern design needs.

 Micro failures are tiny UX problems that make websites feel broken
despite working technically, slowly killing user trust and
conversions. These subtle issues, like button delays and form

quietly without explanation. Fixing these small details becomes
crucial in 2025 when site appearance similarities make user experience
the key differentiator.
