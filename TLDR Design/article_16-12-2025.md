NEWS & TRENDS

 ADOBE SEES A BRIGHT FUTURE AS AI BET PAYS OFF (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe reported record annual revenue of $23.77 billion in 2025, an
11% year-over-year increase, driven primarily by the integration of
generative AI across its creative software and marketing solutions.
AI-influenced annual recurring revenue now accounts for more than
one-third of Adobe's overall business, with CEO Shantanu Narayen
citing strategic partnerships with major AI platforms like AWS, Azure,
Google Gemini, and OpenAI as key accomplishments. 

 IOS 26.2 ADDS NEW WAY FOR YOUR IPHONE TO MAKE NOTIFICATIONS POP (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iOS 26.2 adds several system updates, like Urgent alarms in
Reminders, AI-generated Podcast chapters, Apple News redesigns, and
offline Apple Music lyrics, plus a new notification accessibility
feature. Users can now have the iPhone screen flash brightly for
incoming alerts (alone or with the LED flash), making notifications
harder to miss, especially without an Apple Watch. 

 RUNWAY RELEASES ITS FIRST WORLD MODEL, ADDS NATIVE AUDIO TO LATEST
VIDEO MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Runway's GWM-1 is a world model that simulates physics and real-world
behavior through frame-by-frame prediction. There are specialized
versions for interactive environments (GWM-Worlds), robotics training
(GWM-Robotics), and human avatars (GWM-Avatars). Runway positions
GWM-1 as more general-purpose than competitors like Google's Genie-3,
targeting applications in robotics, life sciences, and agent training.
The company has also updated its Gen 4.5 video model to include native
audio capabilities and long-form multi-shot generation, enabling users
to create one-minute videos with consistent character and dialogue.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PROMPT TO DESIGN INTERFACES: WHY VAGUE PROMPTS FAIL AND HOW TO FIX
THEM (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers often struggle with AI-prototyping tools because vague
prompts produce cluttered, poorly organized interfaces with repeated
elements, illogical content flow, and mismatched visual hierarchy. To
improve results, use precise visual keywords, attach lightweight
visual references or moodboards, conduct AI-powered visual analysis to
formulate prompts, generate mock data for realistic content, and
include code snippets from design systems. While these techniques
enhance prompt specificity and output quality, they cannot replace the
critical thinking and informed decision-making required for effective
design work. 

 A NEW NAVIGATION PARADIGM (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI doesn't eliminate navigation in digital products but delegates it
to invisible algorithmic agents that operate behind conversational
interfaces, creating a "pharmakon"—a remedy and poison
simultaneously. This delegation creates cognitive debt by removing
formative practices such as searching, choosing, and discovering,
while naturalizing algorithmic control under the guise of frictionless
convenience. Meaningful resistance requires critical design
therapeutics that preserve users' capacity for autonomous thinking,
serendipity, and conscious engagement with tools that shape human
cognition. 

 THE DARK PATTERN THAT COST AMAZON $2.5 BILLION (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon leverages dynamic pricing and deceptive interface design to
influence buying decisions, including inflating reference prices to
create the illusion of discounts. It also uses manipulative UX
patterns in Amazon Prime sign-ups and cancellations that prioritize
short-term gains over user trust, but such practices can harm brand
value and increasingly carry legal consequences.

 A GOOGLER EXPLAINS HOW TO “META PROMPT” FOR INCREDIBLE VEO VIDEOS
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google DeepMind UX Engineer Anna Bortsova uses "meta prompting" —
asking Gemini to write detailed prompts for Veo rather than crafting
them herself — to create striking stop-motion, paper-engineered ASMR
videos. Her technique involves instructing Gemini with specific tasks,
format requirements, material constraints, and desired emotional
responses, which then generate elaborate multi-page prompts that
produce high-quality results. Bortsova's approach, which she shares
with colleagues through internal demos and social media, emphasizes
experimentation with subjects you're passionate about while providing
clear creative direction to the AI. 

 LEGO BRICKS TRANSFORM INTO LETTERFORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL DESIGN
PROJECT ‘A2Z' (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A university assignment led designer Pedro Neves to develop a global
project using LEGO bricks as modular tools for type design,
culminating in “A2Z: Learning Through LEGO® and Letterforms”,
which features contributions from 36 designers across six continents.
The project resulted in a publication and exhibition, with thousands
of LEGO bricks used to create and letterpress-print a full alphabet
exploring cultural expression through constrained, playful modular
design. 

 WELCOME TO THE BRAND TWEAK ERA (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Brands are increasingly favouring subtle evolutions over full
rebrands, refining design systems, tone of voice, and messaging to
extract more value from existing identities while preserving
recognisable assets like logos, colours, and symbols. Evidence shows
that maintaining and consistently using these distinctive brand assets
protects recognition, avoids costly backlash, and often delivers
stronger brand equity than dramatic redesigns, making thoughtful
tweaks a smarter path than total facelifts going into 2026.
