 WHY USERS ARE IGNORING YOUR FEATURES (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Premium bank accounts often overwhelm users with bundled features,
making it hard to gauge their value, but reframing and prioritizing
these features can clarify their benefits. Creating a "perk hub,"
sending notifications for valuable actions, hiding irrelevant features
during onboarding, and understanding user needs are key strategies for
enhancing the user experience.

the social aspects of the process rather than the fantasy of design
purity.
