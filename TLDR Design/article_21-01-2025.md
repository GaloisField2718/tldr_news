 WHAT COMES AFTER DESIGN THINKING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design thinking falls short in addressing today's complexities,
requiring a shift toward Community-Powered Transformation, which
fosters trust, collaboration, and shared purpose. This approach builds
resilient networks, unites diverse communities, and drives change
through innovation, marketing, governance, and social impact. 

 THE WEB IS A CREATIVE INDUSTRY AND IS FACING THE SAME DECLINE AND
SHATTERED ECONOMICS AS FILM, TV, OR PUBLISHING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The creative and web developer job markets are struggling, with many
working for free on passion projects or facing job losses due to
generative models. Both industries suffer from poor management,
leading to unsustainable practices. There's a need to focus on serving
end-users directly and creating sustainable, independent projects
rather than relying on unstable industry trends. 

 HOW TO BRING UP INCONVENIENT FEEDBACK, OR WHEN USER INSIGHTS AREN'T
ABOUT DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers often uncover valuable insights outside of UX during user
research. Addressing these insights, even if unrelated to the current
design project, is crucial. By connecting design feedback to business
metrics, designers can ensure stakeholders understand its importance,
potentially impacting the company's bottom line.
