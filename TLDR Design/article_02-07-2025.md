NEWS & TRENDS

 BENTLEY UNVEILS "BIGGEST CHANGE" TO LOGO IN 100-YEAR HISTORY (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bentley has introduced a simplified version of its iconic Winged B
emblem—the first major redesign in over a century—featuring
stylised, diamond-patterned wings and a cleaner, more modern
aesthetic. Designed in-house and debuting on an upcoming concept car,
the new emblem reflects Bentley's shift toward a refined design
language in line with digital and luxury branding trends. 

 SPOTIFY REVAMPS ITS DISCOVER WEEKLY PLAYLIST AFTER 10 YEARS (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Spotify updated its decade-old Discover Weekly playlist with new
genre filter controls, allowing Premium users to guide their
algorithmic recommendations toward specific music styles. The feature
gives listeners more control over their weekly music discovery while
maintaining the playlist's focus on emerging artists, who account for
77% of its streams. This update continues Spotify's recent trend of
giving users more control over their algorithmic recommendations,
following similar changes to queue management and song snoozing
features. 

 GOOGLE IS CHANGING ITS EMOJI LAYOUT, AGAIN (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google reversed its recent Gboard emoji redesign after removing the
dedicated delete button proved unpopular with users during beta
testing. The company had previously eliminated the delete icon in
favor of a floating action button that only appeared after an emoji
was selected. These changes are currently in the beta testing phase
before being potentially rolled out to all users.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN LEADERSHIP IN THE AGE OF AI: SEIZE THE NARRATIVE BEFORE IT'S
TOO LATE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is rapidly reshaping design by automating production and blurring
the lines between roles, meaning many traditional design tasks may
soon be handled by others—or machines. To stay relevant and lead
through this shift, design leaders must act now by redefining their
teams, investing in systems, and embracing strategic, AI-literate
designers who can operate across disciplines and drive innovation in a
fast-changing landscape. 

 TURNING USER RESEARCH INTO REAL ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 User research often fails to drive change when it's misaligned with
business goals, poorly communicated, or lacks follow-through. Still,
with the right strategies, it can become a powerful catalyst for
impact. By aligning research with KPIs, tailoring insights to
stakeholders, simplifying communication, assigning ownership, and
integrating findings into decision-making processes, teams can ensure
their research doesn't just inform, but transforms. 

 REQUIRED FIELDS IN FORMS: BEST DESIGN PRACTICES (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Form design should minimize the number of required fields by
collecting only essential data, as high-friction fields like phone
numbers can trigger abandonment due to privacy concerns. Use asterisks
to mark required fields, or state "all fields required" when
everything is mandatory to reduce visual clutter. Success depends on
balancing user motivation against friction: users complete forms when
perceived value exceeds the combined cost of effort and privacy risk.

 THE RISE OF THE CREATIVE GENERALIST: WHY BEING 'GOOD AT LOTS OF
THINGS' IS BECOMING A SUPERPOWER (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In today's rapidly evolving creative industry—shaped by AI, tighter
budgets, and shifting client needs—being a multi-skilled generalist
is no longer seen as a compromise but a major competitive advantage.

education. The new identity features a wave symbol, rounded

 I'VE DESIGNED AI SEARCH — HERE'S WHAT WORKS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Successful AI-powered search requires thoughtful UX design that
focuses on user trust, control, and clarity, rather than just powerful
models. Eight common problems exist in AI search interfaces, ranging
from users not understanding capabilities to a lack of fallback plans,
and these issues are addressed with corresponding design solutions.
The key to great AI UX lies in setting honest expectations, explaining
decisions, enabling user control, and designing graceful failure
recovery rather than chasing flashy technology.
