MINUTE READ) [4]

emphasizing fitness and style. The series starts with the MoMA Nike
Everyday Sock, which features the iconic Swoosh and MoMA branding.

 MICROSOFT DECIDES IT'S A GOOD TIME FOR BAD UI TO DIE (4 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Microsoft is phasing out the Windows Control Panel, a 40-year-old
interface linked to DOS that has been criticized for its complexity.
Despite affection from some long-time users, it has always been a
flawed and dangerous tool that gave too much power to the hands of the
untrained. Its retirement signifies a move towards centralizing
functions into the more modern but imperfect Settings. This shift
highlights a broader industry issue: the lack of a shared, structured
way to manage device settings, leading to user frustration and
inefficiency. 

 CANVA SAYS ITS AI FEATURES ARE WORTH THE 300 PERCENT PRICE INCREASE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Canva's aggressive rollout of generative AI features will
significantly hike its subscription costs next year. Canva Teams users

from $120 to $500 per year for up to five users, discounted to $300
for the first year. Canva justified this by citing its new AI tools'
enhanced "product experience" and value. Some users have criticized
the steep price hike and are considering switching to alternatives
like Adobe.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY A.I. ISN'T GOING TO MAKE ART (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Art involves numerous choices, often unconscious. AI-generated works
lack these choices, leading to bland or derivative results. While
impressive, AI-generated art lacks the depth and breadth of decisions
found in human-made creations. 

 ASPECTS OF THE EARLY WEB I'D LIKE TO SEE COME BACK (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The early web (1995-2005) was defined by its simplicity, lack of big
data, and opportunities for originality, allowing creators to build
niche communities and unique online cultures. This era's openness and
focus on user privacy offer valuable lessons for shaping the future of
the web. 

 SANDING UI (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 "Sanding UI" involves iteratively testing and refining a user
interface by repeatedly interacting with it, like smoothing wood with
sandpaper. This method identifies issues, such as non-clickable gaps
caused by CSS styling, and resolves them to enhance usability. The
process focuses on continuous adjustments to create a seamless user
experience.
