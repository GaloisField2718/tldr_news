 WE'RE BRINGING GOOGLE'S COMMERCE MEDIA SUITE TO BRANDS AND RETAILERS
(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google has launched its Commerce Media suite in beta, connecting
retailers and brands through AI-driven advertising solutions across
Search Ads 360, Display & Video 360, and Google Ads. The platform
enables measurement of online, app, and offline sales data through
Performance Max campaigns, with Roundel becoming the first retail
media network to offer this capability. New features include improved
self-service catalog sharing for retailers, YouTube commerce
integration, and pilot testing of product-level measurement to assess
media spend effectiveness.

READ) [5] 

 Adobe launched a mobile app for its Firefly generative AI tools on
iPhone and Android. The app features text-to-image and text-to-video
capabilities as well as photo-editing tools like Generative Fill.
Projects created on mobile automatically sync to Creative Cloud
accounts for seamless desktop integration. The company also expanded

third-party AI models from Google, OpenAI, and other partners. 

 IPHONE 17 COLORS: ALL THE RUMORS SO FAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup this fall with
several potential new color options, including a rumored purple or
green for the base model, though only one may make the final cut. The
new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air's colors remain unknown, while the iPhone
17 Pro models may shift from titanium to an aluminum-glass design,
possibly allowing for a broader color range. A Sky Blue finish,
similar to that on the M4 MacBook Air, is rumored for the Pro models
and may replace or join the existing, more muted hues Apple has
traditionally offered.

 FIGMA MCP: COMPLETE GUIDE (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables AI code generators like
Cursor to understand designs at a semantic level rather than just
visual mimicry. The protocol allows AI to access exact design tokens,
variable names, hierarchy, and constraints from Figma, producing code
that is better aligned with design systems. Setup requires enabling
the MCP Server in Figma Desktop and configuring the MCP client in code
editors, though the beta version can be unstable and may require
troubleshooting. 

 7 BRUTALLY HONEST LESSONS I LEARNED AS A FOUNDING DESIGNER IN
STARTUPS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A designer's story of transitioning from graphic to UX design in 2021

uncertainty, they built systems, stretched resources, and developed
resilience, ultimately finding purpose and growth in shaping products
from the ground up. 

 IF THERE IS A GOD IN DESIGN, HE'S PROBABLY CALLED JONY IVE (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The tech industry has long struggled to integrate design
meaningfully, but the partnership between OpenAI and Jony Ive signals
a pivotal moment to manifest AI's potential through tangible,
beautifully crafted products, echoing the transformative role design
played at Apple under Steve Jobs. With AI still largely abstract,
Ive's involvement offers a compelling narrative and strategic edge,
potentially paving the way for iconic devices that could anchor AI in
the physical world and justify soaring valuations.
