 JONY IVE'S SECRETIVE AI HARDWARE REPORTEDLY DELAYED BY THREE
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's upcoming AI hardware device, currently being designed by
Jony Ive, has reportedly been delayed due to three major challenges:
insufficient computing power, unresolved privacy concerns over its
always-on cameras and microphones, and difficulty defining its
personality and conversational boundaries. The device, known as
“io”, is neither a phone nor glasses and aims to feel like a
helpful friend rather than a “weird AI girlfriend.” It may not
launch next year as planned. 

 PERPLEXITY ACQUIRES THE TEAM BEHIND SEQUOIA-BACKED AI DESIGN STARTUP
VISUAL ELECTRIC (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Visual Electric, a Sequoia-backed AI design startup founded in 2022,
announced it is being acquired by search startup Perplexity, with its
team joining a new Agent Experiences group. The acquisition will
result in Visual Electric shutting down its product within 90 days,
offering users data export and prorated refunds. The startup, which
raised $2.5 million and built AI-powered image creation tools for
designers on an infinite canvas, was founded by former employees from
Facebook, Dropbox, Apple, and Microsoft.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MICROSOFT OFFICE REBRAND DEMONSTRATES "HOW AI IS SHIFTING THE
DISCIPLINE OF DESIGN" (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft has refreshed its ten core Office app icons for the first
time since 2018, introducing smoother curves, vibrant gradients, and
simplified shapes to make them more legible and approachable. The
subtle redesign maintains familiar letter plates for instant
recognition and reflects how AI is influencing design and product
development. The new icons will roll out soon across web, desktop, and
mobile. 

 WHY NO IDEA IS FINAL (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In design, iteration is essential—ideas are tested, refined, and
improved—while in life and philosophy, people often cling to fixed
beliefs as part of their identity. Adopting the designer's mindset
means viewing our choices, careers, relationships, and convictions as
hypotheses to evolve through experience and feedback. Growth, then,
comes not from defending old ideas, but from revising them with
honesty and courage, choosing truth and adaptability over pride and
rigidity. 

 AI WILL HAPPILY DESIGN THE WRONG THING FOR YOU (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI tools are powerful leverage for design and product development,
but they amplify whatever users bring to them—whether that's deep
user understanding or poor judgment about unsolved problems. While AI
excels at processing information and streamlining tedious tasks, it
cannot replace the human skills of taste, curation, and genuine
curiosity required to build products that people actually want.
Designers who either completely resist AI or treat it as a magic
solution will struggle, while those who combine human insight with AI
capability will thrive.

 COLLINS' IDENTITY FOR A NEW CLIMATE MOVEMENT EMULATES THE HEALING
FEELING OF SITTING IN THE SUN (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Collins has created a visual identity for Sun Day, a new global
climate action movement founded by Bill McKibben and Denis Hayes that
emphasizes unity, collective action, and the healing power of solar
energy. The identity features a flexible half-sun logo that invites
individuals to “complete” it, symbolizing shared participation,
alongside a living typeface inspired by protest posters and a digital
platform where people worldwide can contribute their own suns,
reinforcing the idea that everyone is part of one global,
solar-powered community. 

 10 ESSENTIAL SKETCHBOOK WARM-UP EXERCISES TO GET INTO THE CREATIVE
FLOW (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sketchbook warm-up exercises help artists loosen up physically and
mentally, improving line quality, coordination, and focus before
drawing. Common warm-ups include mark-making, drawing parallel lines,
circles, shading, scribbling, blind contour drawing, 3D forms, gesture
sketches, and creating variations—all designed to build confidence
and fluidity. Some artists warm up by directly planning elements of
their upcoming sketch. 

 GOOD UX IS STILL IMPORTANT EVEN WHEN USERS ARE FORCED TO USE YOUR
SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Designing internal applications presents unique challenges, as users
are often required to use the software, making traditional metrics
such as user retention irrelevant for measuring design impact. The
CASTLE framework addresses this by tracking six key areas—Cognitive
Load, Advanced Feature Usage, Satisfaction, Task Efficiency,
Learnability, and Errors—that directly connect to business concerns,
such as employee productivity, training costs, and software ROI.
Designers can demonstrate their value by aligning CASTLE metrics with
existing business goals, prioritizing relevant measurements based on
specific problems, and gathering data through methods like user
testing, support tickets, and pulse surveys.
