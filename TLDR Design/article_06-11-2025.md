 FANS ARE SERIOUSLY OVERREACTING TO APPLE'S 'NEW' 3D LOGO (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Apple's stacked, colorful logo for its Apple One subscription service
has sparked criticism online, with some calling it ugly and childish.
The playful design utilizes wooden block-like pieces to represent
bundled services. Critics claim that Apple's design team lacks
coherence. Defenders argue the colorful approach is a harmless
departure from Apple's typically minimal aesthetic and echoes the
company's retro rainbow logo. 

 I'M ABSOLUTELY LOVING THE AFFINITY REBRAND (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Affinity recently launched a free, unified suite of three apps
alongside a bold new brand identity. The rebrand, created with input
from Affinity, Canva, and the design community, emphasizes creativity
and attitude. It features a distinctive logo, custom typeface, playful
campaign assets, and even a quirky file-naming convention, reflecting
a fresh, irreverent approach that aligns with its “for creatives, by
creatives” motto. 

 APPLE HAS LAUNCHED AN UPDATED WEB INTERFACE FOR THE APP STORE (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has revamped its App Store website into a central hub for
exploring apps across all its platforms. The new design unifies search
and browsing and offers curated collections and category filters, but
still doesn't allow direct downloads from the web.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY I DON'T TEST DIFFERENT DESIGNS AT THE SAME TIME (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Testing two designs simultaneously creates problems, such as unclear
results, contaminated data from participants learning between
versions, and requiring three times as many participants. Test one
properly-designed version, identify its problems, and fix them rather
than conducting comparative evaluations. This approach is presented as
more efficient since differences that seem significant to designers
often appear identical to users, making comparative testing
unnecessary. 

 THE TIKTOK MODEL IS THE FUTURE OF THE WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The TikTok model of algorithmic content curation is spreading beyond
social media, threatening to replace active searching with passive
consumption of personalized feeds across the entire web. These
algorithms prioritize company profits and engagement over user
benefit, creating addictive dopamine loops while eroding shared
cultural experiences and trapping users in filter bubbles. Users can
resist this future by taking control of their digital experience
through changing default settings, deleting exploitative apps, using
ad blockers, and actively curating their own content. 

 KNOW THIS, DESIGNERS – YOUR WORK IS ACTUALLY A HUGE INCONVENIENCE
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Working in branding is as much about navigating the complex journey
of bringing an idea to life as it is about the idea itself. True
success comes from partnering with clients, understanding the business
landscape, building consensus, adapting to challenges, and protecting
the creative work through a long, often unglamorous process, so that
when a rebrand finally launches, it thrives because it was fought for
and supported every step of the way.

 DANISH FOOTBALL BRANDING: IDENTITY AND VISUALS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Danish women's football league has rebranded to elevate the
sport, focusing on the game rather than gender. The rename, alongside
a modular visual identity inspired by pitch lines and emotions on the
field, is aimed at creating a proud, independent brand that appeals to
fans and sponsors alike. 

 THE SHORTEST PATH FROM THOUGHT TO ACTION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fitts' Law, originating from Paul Fitts' 1954 experiments on motor
control, predicts that target acquisition time increases with distance
and decreases with size. Initially foundational for mouse- and
pointer-based interfaces, it now informs mobile ergonomics, touch
targets, gesture-based spatial computing, and even voice and neural
interfaces. Across all modalities, the core principle endures: design
should minimize the effort—physical, cognitive, or
emotional—between user intent and system response, making
interactions feel seamless and natural.
