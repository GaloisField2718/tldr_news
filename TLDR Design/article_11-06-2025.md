NEWS & TRENDS

 ROKU IS TESTING A NEW LOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Roku is testing a redesigned homepage with a new Quick Access section
that automatically displays users' most visited apps. The update moves
the cursor directly to the main grid when pressing home while
relocating options like "Live TV" and "Featured Free" from the left
sidebar to make them more discoverable. New sections include
"Subscriptions" for viewing all subscription content in one place and
"For You." Personalized recommendations have replaced the previous
"What to Watch" feature. 

 INTRODUCING MODIFY VIDEO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Luma's Modify Video is a new tool that allows professional creatives
to change video environments, lighting, and textures while preserving
the original performance and motion. The tool offers motion capture
capabilities to extract movement data and apply it to new characters
or objects, plus the ability to transform scenes from garages to
spaceships while maintaining the original framing. Users can edit
individual elements like wardrobe or props without affecting the
entire shot using three structured presets ranging from close
adherence to creative reimagining. 

 LOVE IT OR HATE IT? APPLE'S NEW ‘LIQUID GLASS' DESIGN IS GETTING
MIXED REVIEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Early testers have criticized Apple's new “Liquid Glass” user
interface for poor readability, especially in notifications and the
Control Center, where background blur and font contrast are lacking,
though these issues may still be addressed before public release.
Despite the rough start, Liquid Glass includes promising visual
details and effects, suggesting Apple is laying the groundwork for
more immersive, AI-integrated interfaces in the future.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHERE SHOULD AI SIT IN YOUR UI? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Large language models are driving a shift from simple chatbot
interfaces to more deeply integrated, task-focused layouts such as
inline prompts, infinite canvases, and intelligent spreadsheets. These
spatial designs—whether side panels, chat widgets, or dynamic
grids—not only affect usability but also shape how users understand
the AI's role, capabilities, and trustworthiness within the
experience. 

 DO GRAPHIC DESIGNERS NEED NEW SKILLS TO BEAT AI? PROFESSIONALS WEIGH
IN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Graphic designers are facing growing uncertainty about AI's impact on
their careers, but many industry voices remain optimistic, emphasizing
that creativity, vision, and adaptability still set human designers
apart. While AI is becoming a valuable tool, success in the field will
increasingly depend on evolving skillsets, strategic thinking, and the
ability to integrate technology without losing the human touch. 

 COLLABORATION: THE MOST UNDERRATED UX SKILL NO ONE TALKS ABOUT (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Collaboration is the most underrated skill in UX. It's different from
mere cooperation, which emphasizes co-ownership of outcomes rather
than just individual task completion. While AI tools can accelerate
ideation and prototyping, they cannot replace human judgment and the
need for validation from teammates who understand users, technical
constraints, and business goals. Strengthening collaboration skills
involves cultivating curiosity about teammates' challenges,
facilitating structured conversations, sharing work early, practicing
active listening, and co-owning outcomes rather than defending
individual designs.

 AFTER 25 LOYAL YEARS, ADOBE'S PRICE HIKE HAS FORCED ME TO SAY GOODBYE
(3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A 25-year Adobe user announces their departure from the software

forcing a price jump from £82 to £249 for the same Photoshop and
