 GETTY'S LANDMARK AI SCRAPING TRIAL BEGINS IN UK (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Getty Images is pursuing a landmark copyright lawsuit against
Stability AI in London's High Court, alleging the AI company used
millions of Getty's copyrighted photos without permission to train its
models. Stability AI contends that the training occurred outside the
UK and argues that only a tiny portion of its AI-generated outputs
resemble Getty images, framing the dispute as about technological
innovation and fair use. Getty maintains this isn't anti-AI but about
requiring proper licensing and payment for copyrighted works, noting
it has licensed content to other tech companies for AI training
purposes. 

 META'S NEW AI VIDEO TOOL CAN PUT YOU IN A DESERT, OR AT LEAST TRY TO
(1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has launched a new AI-powered video editing tool that allows
users to apply over 50 preset prompts to the first 10 seconds of their
clips, transforming backgrounds, clothing, and themes through the Meta
AI and Edits apps. While users can restyle videos into various formats
like anime or desert scenes, the results can be inconsistent and often
less polished than Meta's own examples. The feature is currently free
for a limited time and available in the US and over a dozen other
countries. Support for custom prompts is expected later this year. 

 THE BROWSER COMPANY LAUNCHES ITS AI-FIRST BROWSER, DIA, IN BETA (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Browser Company has launched Dia, an AI-first browser, in beta.
Dia is designed to integrate AI directly into users' web workflows.
Following the limited adoption of its previous browser Arc, the
company has shifted focus to Dia, which features an AI chatbot built
into the URL bar that can search the web, summarize files, write
drafts based on open tabs, and adapt to user preferences. Although AI
integration in browsers is not new, Dia distinguishes itself with
features like Skills, History-based context, and a more seamless,
customizable AI interface aimed at replacing standalone tools like
ChatGPT and Perplexity.

 BILL ATKINSON'S 10 RULES FOR MAKING INTERFACES MORE HUMAN (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Legendary Apple engineer who created QuickDraw and HyperCard, Bill
Atkinson, established ten principles for human-centered interface
design that continue to influence modern tools like Figma. These
include designing within constraints rather than around them,
democratizing creativity through accessible tools, and making
interfaces feel inevitable while hiding complexity behind simplicity.
Atkinson's legacy lies in creating foundational platforms that enable
new categories of creation, optimizing for human perception and
delight, and building tools that teach users through direct
experimentation rather than abstract instruction. 

 HOW TO GROW AS A DESIGNER EVEN WHEN YOU'RE OVERWHELMED WITH WORK (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers can grow professionally by incorporating small-scale
experiments into their work projects rather than waiting for free time
to learn new skills. The key is identifying specific weak points in
your design process and testing targeted solutions, such as using AI
tools to explore different grid layouts or improve the documentation
workflow. Success comes from gradual 1% improvements through focused
experimentation that doesn't jeopardize project deadlines, which
allows designers to evolve their skills while meeting work demands. 

 LIQUID GLASS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple's new Liquid Glass design in iOS 26 marks a strategic shift
toward unifying visual language across platforms like iOS and
VisionOS, but it introduces a conceptual dissonance by prioritizing
visual spectacle over interaction clarity. While technically
impressive, the refractive glass metaphor contradicts users' physical
understanding of touch interfaces, raising concerns that Apple has
moved away from its first-principles design philosophy in favor of
aesthetic consistency.

 DRAW WHAT YOU SEE: NINE OBSERVATION EXERCISES TO TRAIN YOUR ARTIST'S
EYE (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post presents nine observation exercises that help artists learn
to truly see their subjects rather than rely on preconceived notions
of how things should look. Key techniques include drawing inverted
images to force closer observation, focusing on negative space instead
of objects, and practicing blind contour drawing to develop intense
concentration on subjects. Additional methods involve drawing from
memory to identify missed details, using imaginary lines to understand
spatial relationships, and describing scenes in words before drawing
to encourage slow, careful observation of complexity. 

 BEHIND NIKE'S VISUALS: THE POWER OF MOTION DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ)

emotionally resonant internal storytelling experience. 

 APPLE RETREATS (25 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 WWDC 2025 marked a humbling shift for Apple, as it acknowledged
unfulfilled AI promises from the previous year and instead refocused
on core strengths like hardware-software integration, continuity
features, and a new unified design language called Liquid Glass.
Rather than chasing generative AI hype, Apple's keynote emphasized a
strategic retreat to what it does best — delivering polished,
tightly integrated user experiences and enabling developers, signaling
a more grounded and sustainable path forward.
