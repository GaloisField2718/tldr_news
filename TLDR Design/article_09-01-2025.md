MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The MacBook Pro is expected to undergo a major redesign in 2026,
becoming thinner and lighter while retaining the power of Apple
Silicon. Users hope Apple will avoid past mistakes by maintaining the
restored ports and prioritizing functionality. Another key aspect of
the MacBook Pro redesign is its display, which is expected to ditch
the notch as part of a switch to OLED.

Bluesky, including setting display names and adding cover images.

 MICROSOFT'S OUTRAGEOUS GOOGLE WEBSITE IMITATION BRANDED A 'NEW LOW'
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft redesigned its Bing search results page to closely mimic
Google's web design, sparking accusations of deceptive tactics. The
page features a Google-like doodle, a similar text layout to Google's
search page, and automatic scrolling that hides Bing's branding,
leading to user confusion. Designers have pointed out that this
blatant imitation highlights the importance of originality in web
design and reinforces the need for distinct, user-friendly interfaces.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHAT'S THE OBJECT OF INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE? (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Unlike other design disciplines, information architecture (IA)
struggles with mainstream recognition due to its abstract nature and
lack of a tangible central object. This abstraction makes it hard for
people to grasp IA's value. IA may need to target niche audiences who
can appreciate its unique role in organizing information. 

 THE RISE AND FALL OF NEUMORPHISM (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Neumorphism, a design trend that blends realism and minimalism,
emerged around 2019-2020 and gained popularity in design communities.
It aimed to create visually distinct UIs but faced challenges such as
low contrast, usability issues, and limited practicality. Offering new
aesthetic approaches, trends like Glassmorphism and Skeuomorphism 2.0
gained traction after its decline. 

 A DESIGNER'S GUIDE TO THE NEW EPR PACKAGING LAWS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The UK's new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) law shifts
packaging disposal costs from taxpayers to producers, encouraging
sustainable packaging. This change significantly impacts design,
demanding sustainable practices from the start. Designers like Sophie
Thomas see it as a chance for innovation, pushing for responsible
packaging and long-term product durability.
