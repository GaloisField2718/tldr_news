OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WE BUILT UX. WE BROKE UX. AND NOW WE HAVE TO FIX IT! (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 UX lost influence because it prioritized process over purpose and
focused on tools rather than outcomes. Oversimplification, broken
feedback loops, and unchecked industry expansion diluted its impact.
Designers became executors instead of strategists, sidelined as AI and
business demands reshaped priorities. 

 LET DESIGNERS DESIGN: THE CREATIVE TRAP OF ENDLESS A/B TESTING (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over-reliance on A/B testing and data-driven decisions can stifle
creativity and lead to unoriginal designs. Designers should trust
their judgment, make intentional decisions, and balance data with
experience to create unique and impactful work. 

 “NEVER BULLSH*T” – WHAT CLIENT SERVICES WANT DESIGNERS TO KNOW
(7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Strong relationships, trust, and understanding of business needs are
essential for successful design projects. Designers should build
relationships, balance creativity with practicality, and communicate
effectively. Avoiding last-minute surprises, respecting budgets, and
being well-prepared for meetings strengthens collaboration. Clear
communication and flexibility improves both project outcomes and
client satisfaction.

 MAINTAINING SCREENSHOT QUALITY AND COLOR PROFILE IN FIGMA (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Designers often lose screenshot quality and the Display P3 color
profile when transferring iOS screenshots into Figma, updating
designs, and exporting final images. To maintain high quality, best
practices include properly transferring images, using Figma's Image
Fill method, and selecting the correct export settings. 

 HOW CULTURAL DIFFERENCES INFLUENCE UX DESIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cultural values significantly impact UX design, influencing
aesthetics, user behavior, and interaction patterns. Western designs
prioritize simplicity and individual autonomy, while Asian designs
emphasize richness, multifunctionality, and community. Learning from
both approaches can create more inclusive, engaging, and compelling
user experiences catering to diverse cultural preferences and
expectations. 

 AI IS THE FUTURE OF ACCESSIBILITY (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Dismissing AI's role in accessibility is shortsighted. AI enhances
accessibility through real-time captions, speech recognition,
navigation tools, and assistive apps. While imperfect now, it's
rapidly improving. Just like past innovations reshaped industries, AI
will redefine accessibility. Advocates must engage now to ensure
inclusive, adaptive, and transformative technological progress.
