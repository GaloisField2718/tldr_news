OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN FOR THE AI AGE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional interfaces offer predictable user journeys, but AI and
language models introduce dynamic, unpredictable interactions that
challenge this structure. While chat feels familiar, it is a limited
format for AI, calling for more intentional design. Designers must now
rethink their approach, building purpose-driven tools, like a
"workbench," that blends traditional UI with AI to provide clarity,
context, and control. 

 IOS 19 DESIGN LEAK SHOWS APPLE MAY HAVE FOUND A WINNING FORMULA (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Jon Prosser's latest video reveals iOS 19 mockups that suggest Apple
is updating the look of iOS while keeping key elements like tab bars
intact. The redesign adds features like a bottom search bar and
refreshed icons, aiming to modernize without disrupting the user
experience longtime iPhone users expect. 

 TESTING DESIGN SYSTEMS IN 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern testing of design systems now favors integrated environments
like Storybook with Vitest browser mode. This setup simplifies
testing, improves coverage, eliminates duplication, and supports real
browser APIs. Though more verbose and experimental, it unifies testing
logic and execution in one place, enhancing developer experience and
test reliability across components.
