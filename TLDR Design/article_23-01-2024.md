 BIT BY BIT: HOW PLAY DESIGNED A FRESH AND FITTING IDENTITY FOR
OPENAI‚ÄôS FIRST DEVDAY CONFERENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Design studio Play collaborated with OpenAI to create an identity for
OpenAI's DevDay conference. It centered its design around the concept
of a "bit," the smallest unit of computer data, and used the concept
creatively across various touchpoints, including the stage design and
event swag. Play balanced modern design with familiar typography and
warm colors to capture the essence of the conference and its focus on
technology's role in our future. 

 HOW DESIGN DROVE $10M IN PRE-ORDERS FOR RABBIT R1 AI HARDWARE (9
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rabbit CEO Jesse Lyu's unique approach to building the Rabbit R1
included buying Tamagotchis for each team member, drawing inspiration
from walkie-talkies, and considering phones in the user experience.
The risk associated with integrating AI into the experience could be
mitigated if the device looked and felt familiar. Lyu believes
pursuing the hardware path will result in a more defensible business,
especially if it is coupled with an attractive price point.

 Five potential roles for designers in an AI-driven world are
Meta-Designer, Chief Ontology Officer, Coherence Generator, Drifting

 TREE TESTING PART 2: INTERPRETING THE RESULTS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are three tree-testing metrics that designers should focus on:
success rate, or how many users found the right category; directness,
or the percentage of users who went to the right category immediately;
and time spent, or the average amount of time elapsed from the
beginning to the end of the task. 

 PRIORITIZE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH INSIGHTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY GAP
SURVEY (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The opportunity gap survey measures how satisfied people are with
current solutions compared to how important each insight is. It's the
difference between the perceived importance and the perceived level of
satisfaction. The more significant the gap between someone's essential
beliefs and their current level of satisfaction, the bigger the
opportunity.

 IMMANUEL KANT ‚Äî WHAT IS BEAUTY? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kant believed that beauty is connected to our perception and a
failure of rational understanding. At the same time, the sublime is a
feeling of overwhelming power that awakens our moral sense of good and
bad. Beauty and the sublime can be found in nature and art, but we
must cultivate our taste and character to experience them fully. 

 WHAT IS OUR DESIGN INTENTION? (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The deep-rooted relationship we‚Äôre designing and have with our
smart devices is creating significant issues that everyone avoids
discussing ‚Äî digital eye strain, dementia, and ‚ÄúTeck neck.‚Äù As
designers, we are responsible for considering the long-term
consequences of our creations and striving to create solutions that
benefit everyone rather than just prioritizing profit or attention.

 There are a lot of common and well-understood accessibility issues,

experiences, there will be more edge cases. Less frequent but still
essential examples include using color to communicate interactivity,
traps in focus, inconsistent date fields, and unexpected navigation.
