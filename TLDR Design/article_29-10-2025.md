NEWS & TRENDS

 LEAKER SAYS ‘IPHONE 20' WILL DROP EVERY PHYSICAL BUTTON, GO ALL-IN
ON HAPTICS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Leaks suggest Apple's 20th-anniversary iPhone, expected in 2027, may
feature an all-glass wrap-around display and eliminate all physical
buttons in favor of solid-state ones with haptic feedback. The design
would mark a major shift similar to the iPhone X's anniversary debut,
though details could still change before launch. 

 PINTEREST EXPERIMENTS WITH NEW AI-POWERED PERSONALIZED BOARDS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest is rolling out AI-powered features to transform its boards
into personalized shopping and style tools, including "Styled for you"
collages that help users mix and match saved fashion items and "Boards
made for you" with curated outfit inspiration. The company is testing
these features in the US and Canada over the next few months, aligning
with its goal to become an AI-enabled shopping assistant. New tabs
will also organize saved Pins by categories like "Make It Yours" for
personalized product recommendations and "More Ideas" for related
suggestions across beauty, recipes, and other topics. 

 STABILITY AI AND EA PARTNER TO EMPOWER ARTISTS, DESIGNERS, AND
DEVELOPERS TO REIMAGINE GAME DEVELOPMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stability AI and Electronic Arts have formed a strategic partnership
to co-develop generative AI models, tools, and workflows that will
transform how EA's creative teams design and build games. The
collaboration will focus on accelerating asset creation, including
developing new workflows for generating physically based rendering
materials and previsualizing 3D environments from prompts to enable
faster iteration and prototyping. By embedding Stability AI's 3D
research team directly with EA's artists and developers, the
partnership aims to unlock new creative possibilities in
world-building and visual storytelling while maintaining artist
control and quality.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNING AI PRODUCTS AND FEATURES: STUDY GUIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Nielsen Norman Group's study guide compiles research-based
recommendations for designing AI products. The collection covers
strategic considerations, such as determining AI's value proposition,
practical guidance on prompt assistance and interface design, and
product-specific recommendations for features like review summaries
and intranet integrations. Resources include articles that examine
AI's four "superpowers" (content creation, summarization, data
analysis, and perspective-taking) and best practices for hybrid
interfaces that combine prompts with traditional GUIs. 

 THE MYTH OF A PERFECT DESIGN (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Perfect design is impossible because every design involves tradeoffs
among competing objectives — such as business needs, customer
satisfaction, and resource constraints — with no algorithm to
balance them all. The challenge intensifies as user needs constantly
evolve, people adapt their behavior to work around flaws, and
different user groups have conflicting requirements. Success depends
on designers, engineers, and business leaders developing cross-domain
fluency to make informed tradeoff decisions rather than seeking
mythical optimization formulas. 

 ADOBE'S PERSONALISED AI GENERATORS COULD CHANGE CREATIVE SOFTWARE
FOREVER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 At Adobe MAX 2025, Adobe announced a shift toward personalized AI
with custom Firefly models for brands and creators, letting users
train generative tools on their own content and style. It also
introduced Project Moonlight, AI assistants that analyze social media
to suggest ideas, and expanded partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and
others. New tools like AI Object Mask, Assisted Culling, and the
high-resolution Firefly Image Model 5 further enhance Adobe's
intelligent, creative ecosystem.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ALIENATION BY DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design systems intended to reduce friction and improve efficiency may
erode everyday human interactions that help people feel less alone,
contributing to social isolation. While video games can provide
cognitive benefits and reduce loneliness in elderly populations when
designed for collaboration, the digitization of services often
prioritizes productivity over preserving opportunities for
face-to-face connection. Designers should consider second-order
consequences of their work, as systems that sever small human bonds
collectively weaken society's fabric, even when meeting their intended
success criteria. 

 TIMEDASH: WHERE RETRO WATCH AESTHETICS MEET MODERN WIDGETS (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Timedash, created by former Pentagram designers, revives the 1970s
Ana Digi watch aesthetic through customizable widgets for iPhone,
iPad, and Mac. The newly redesigned Timedash Widgets 2 lets users
build modular dashboards combining data like steps, weather, and date
with sleek, retro-futurist visuals. Blending design culture with
functionality, it aims to make personal data visualization both
elegant and playful. 

 IF CREATIVITY IS A DELICATE ECOSYSTEM, HOW DO WE KEEP THINGS IN
BALANCE? EMMI SALONEN'S NEW BOOK EXPLORES CREATIVE BURNOUT (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Finnish designer Emmi Salonen, founder of Studio Emmi, transformed
her burnout experience into “The Creative Wellbeing Handbook”, a
guide to sustaining creativity through balance rather than constant
output. Inspired by her travels and global conversations, she
developed a “creative ecosystem” model that emphasized five key
inputs: connection, wonder, pause, movement, and joy. Featuring
insights from over 100 creatives worldwide, the book reframes rest and
self-nourishment as essential parts of the creative process and offers
practical tools for a more sustainable creative life.
