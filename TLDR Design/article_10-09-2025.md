 SCENE IT TO BELIEVE IT: POPULATE 3D WORLDS QUICKLY WITH NVIDIA AI
BLUEPRINTS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NVIDIA released an AI Blueprint for 3D object generation that enables
artists to create up to 20 3D objects from text prompts, streamlining
the traditionally time-consuming prototyping process. The workflow
integrates Microsoft's TRELLIS model via a new NVIDIA NIM
microservice, which generates high-quality 3D assets 20% faster than
the native model. Artists can automatically export generated objects
to Blender or other 3D applications. The system works on NVIDIA
GeForce RTX GPUs with 16GB or more memory. 

 ADOBE'S LATEST LEGAL CLASH DOESN'T COME AS A SURPRISE (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Adobe is facing a new class action lawsuit accusing it of misleading
customers with unclear subscription terms, hidden fees, and
intentionally difficult cancellation processes that leave users
feeling trapped. The case reflects growing backlash over Adobe's
pricing, AI changes, and business practices, threatening the company's
reputation among creatives.

 A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO HARNESSING AI FOR DESIGN WORK (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Generative AI offers rapid creative output, but designers must resist
treating initial AI results as finished work and instead focus on
disciplined iteration and craft. The "EDEN Loop" framework (Explore,
Diagnose, Elevate, and Nurture) helps designers harness AI as a
creative multiplier rather than replacement, emphasizing the need for
human judgment in art direction and brand storytelling. The approach
cautions against allowing emerging designers to master AI prompts
before they have learned fundamental design principles, instead
advocating for AI as an amplification tool that still requires human
pilots to navigate toward authentic, culturally sensitive brand work. 

 HOW TO MAKE A BIG IMPACT WITH A SMALL TEAM: DESIGN OPS AT SLACK (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Slack's Design Operations team demonstrates how a small three-person
team can drive significant impact by strategically dividing
responsibilities across business strategy, people programs, and
product systems. The team operates through focused leadership
alignment, thoughtful designer experience programs, and scalable
processes that provide structure while maintaining flexibility. Their
collaborative approach emphasizes working smarter rather than larger,
proving that lean teams can create meaningful organizational change
when they prioritize strategic focus and cross-functional partnership.

 IDC STUDY SAYS THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE ENGAGED IN SOFTWARE DESIGN IS
EXPANDING (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 IDC research forecasts the global software design workforce will
expand by over 30% from 107 million to 144 million people between 2025
and 2029. UX design roles are expected to grow fastest at 7.6%
annually, outpacing other knowledge worker categories due to
increasing demand for design-intensive solutions. Generative AI will
accelerate product development while creating pressure for designers
to deliver highly usable and visually appealing AI features. 

 THE ICEBERG UX MODEL: DESIGNING FOR AI-FIRST INTERFACES (10 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The Iceberg UX Model emphasizes that 90% of an AI product's user
experience lies beneath the visible interface, focusing on error
handling, trust mechanisms, and failure recovery rather than just
polished UI design. Most AI product teams fail by over-prioritizing
visual design while neglecting invisible layers like fallback flows,
confidence indicators, and system transparency that determine user
trust and retention. A successful AI-first UX workflow should start
with user needs, map failure states, test trust patterns, and build
foundational invisible layers before designing the interface.

inspired by Europe's interwar lettering, especially the Dutch
avant-garde. Drawing on fieldwork, archives, and overlooked sources,
they and their collaborators reinterpret historic alphabets into
contemporary typefaces, offering designers distinctive alternatives
for branding and media while planning future releases and a book on
monumental Dutch lettering.
