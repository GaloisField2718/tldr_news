NEWS & TRENDS

 ADOBE RELEASES ‘CREATED WITHOUT GENERATIVE AI' TAG TO LABEL
HUMAN-GENERATED ART (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Generative AI has stirred debate in the design world, with some
embracing it and others seeing it as a threat to creative
authenticity. In response, Adobe added a “created without generative
AI” tag in its Fresco app, letting artists certify hand-made work
through its Content Credentials system. While expanding its AI tools
and integrations, Adobe also supports transparency and gives creators
the option to separate their work from AI-generated content. 

 FIGMA INTEGRATES NEW AI TOOLS: IMAGE EDITING, GENERATION, AND MODEL
SELECTION (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma is expanding its AI design tools for paid users with new beta
features that simplify image editing and content creation. The
standout update, Edit Image, uses OpenAI's gpt-image-1 to let users
modify images with text prompts, such as changing backgrounds, moving
objects, or adding elements. Users can also choose from image
generation models by OpenAI, Google, and Amazon. Other tools like
Rename Layers, Boost Resolution, and Replace Content further improve
the design process.

 THE ART OF ART DIRECTION (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Art direction at Figma involves balancing brand identity with
personal taste and aligning collaborators' styles with the needs of
each project. It's described as a communication-driven craft rooted in
repetition, intuition, and a willingness to trust illustrators to
explore and interpret ideas freely. Creative success often comes from
allowing space for surprise and personal investment, resulting in work
that feels both unexpected and emotionally engaging. 

 WHY TASTE MATTERS NOW MORE THAN EVER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI automates design tasks that were once done by hand, shifting the
designer's role from execution to interpretation. What now matters is
not creating visuals, but assigning meaning, providing context, and
exercising good taste. Designers have become curators and translators,
guiding AI with intention and purpose. Creative direction, rather than
technical skill, is emerging as the true differentiator in design.

design. Inspired by museum stanchions, it features cast metal bases
and a suspended LED strand, creating a warm, refined glow. Though
still a concept, its sleek form, energy efficiency, and versatility
highlight the dedication to timeless, functional aesthetics.
