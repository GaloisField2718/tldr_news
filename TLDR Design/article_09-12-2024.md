audience-focused experiences.

 Jaguar revealed its new electric four-door GT concept, Type 00, as
part of its bold rebrand into the EV era. Featuring unconventional
design and luxury materials, the design of the 1,000-horsepower car

 AIRLINES REDESIGNED THE WAY YOU CHOOSE YOUR SEAT—AND RAKED IN $12.4
BILLION IN THE PROCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Airlines generated $12.4 billion from seat fees between 2018 and 2023
by exploiting dynamic pricing and using deceptive practices. Rising
ancillary fees complicate ticket purchases with add-ons for seats,

their fairness under transportation tax laws.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HARSH TRUTHS FOR FREELANCERS AND AGENCIES (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design agencies thrive by aligning pricing, structure, and client
needs. Big clients prioritize security, while smaller ones seek
flexibility. High-value projects demand predictable costs, and
collaboration outshines asynchronous work. Engineering integration
boosts revenue but redefines agency identity. Design subscriptions
fade - enterprise clients provide steady, significant income compared
to flashy projects. 

 SERVICE DESIGN IS NOT MOSTLY CONVINCING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO SERVICE
DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effective designers collaborate, visualize complexity, and focus on
improving services rather than debating definitions or ideal
conditions. Advocacy alone risks irrelevance - showing impact through
practice fosters better outcomes. Success comes from doing the work,
integrating user expectations, and shaping services in real-world,
imperfect environments.
