MINUTE READ) [6]

and embracing more tactile, detailed designs, signaling the return of
skeuomorphism. This shift is part of a broader trend rejecting the
uniformity of modern digital aesthetics in favor of nostalgic,
visually rich elements reminiscent of past designs. As digital
environments become increasingly sterile, users are gravitating toward
warmer, more textured interfaces that feel more engaging and real.
