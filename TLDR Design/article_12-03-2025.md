 HOW ONE AGENCY CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVES 90+ GOOGLE PAGESPEED SCORES
ACROSS ALL WORDPRESS SITES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As an agency, managing WordPress sites across multiple platforms is
tough. Each system brings different tools and inconsistent quality,
leading to extra work. And slow hosts are a constant pain...

Torro Media, a Boston web design agency with a large client base,
found a simple fix: move all sites to Kinsta [4].

“It's a night and day difference [4]. The tools, features and
services are just never up to the level of Kinsta, and that frustrates
us so much. It's always a challenge when a customer's sites are hosted
with another hosting provider.

The overall speed and performance are noticeably different, especially
compared to Kinsta sites' speed with CDN." — Matt Sullivan, Founder
of Torro Media.” — Matt Sullivan, Founder of Torro Media.
