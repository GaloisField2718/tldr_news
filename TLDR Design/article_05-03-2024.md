viability - whether the project fits your organization's goals.

 ELIZABETH GOODSPEED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TASTE ‚Äì AND HOW TO ACQUIRE
IT (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 It's not the technology that makes AI imagery so bad, but the
clich√©s and superficial creative ambitions of those who use it. In
other words, they lack taste, and AI can't generate good taste. Taste
is crucial for designers to create interesting, unique work, as it
allows them to navigate the possibilities made possible by technology
and global connectivity. 

 AI CHAT IS NOT (ALWAYS) THE ANSWER (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI does not have to be anthropomorphized, conversational, or even
visible to the user to add value to an experience. Designers should
consider more diverse ways to integrate AI into products through
personalization, predictive analytics, strategic automation, and
automating customer support.
