 PENTAGRAM'S GALLOPING HORSE LOGO STEERS TWELVELABS REBRAND (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Pentagram developed a dynamic, equine-inspired identity for AI video
platform TwelveLabs that emphasized its distinctive focus on video
understanding rather than generation. The branding features a
galloping horse logo, thread-based visual metaphors, and an intuitive
color system. These elements convey TwelveLabs' advanced temporal
video analysis, helping it stand out from competitors and resonate
with both technical and creative audiences. 

 USPS MARKS 250 YEARS WITH NEW VISUAL IDENTITY AND COMMEMORATIVE
STAMPS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The USPS unveiled a refreshed identity that featured the “Eagle in
Flight” symbol to commemorate its 250th anniversary. The emblem
retains its red, white, and blue palette while evoking forward motion.
Stamps mark the 250th anniversaries of the Army, Navy, and Marine
Corps. The celebration also includes a coffee table book and branded
merchandise, underscoring USPS's design focus and its historic role in
American communication. 

 MAC BROWSER ARC BEING DISCONTINUED IN FAVOR OF NEW DIA APP (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Arc, the Mac browser designed to feel like a personal “internet
computer,” has been discontinued in favor of a new app called Dia.
While Arc had a loyal user base, its steep learning curve and complex
feature set prompted the company to start fresh. Dia aims to carry
forward the same vision with greater simplicity, speed, and security,
focusing on accessibility in an AI-first future.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE NEXT DESIGN TREND SHOULD START WITH YOUR HANDS, NOT A COMPUTER (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's growing pressure to follow tech-driven design trends, such as
Airbnb's Lava icons. However, rather than conforming, designers should
embrace handmade techniques. Methods like suminagashi, gelli printing,
woodcut, and analog collage offer a tactile alternative to the sterile
feel of corporate design. Trends should celebrate imperfection and the
human touch, rather than relying solely on digital templates or
AI-generated aesthetics. 

 FIGMA'S NEW GRID — YOU MUST UNDERSTAND CSS GRID AS A DESIGNER (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To get the most out of Figma's new grid system, designers should
understand CSS Grid, whose structure Figma mimics, though not its full
capabilities. Unlike CSS Grid, Figma lacks browser-native features
like fractional units, implicit grids, and intrinsic sizing. By
learning CSS Grid, designers can build more responsive,
developer-aligned layouts that better bridge the gap between design
and implementation. 

 THE TRAITS THAT WILL DEFINE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CREATIVE LEADERS
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 As AI and automation reshape the creative industry, the role of
creatives is shifting from execution to leadership. Traits like
strategic thinking, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and refined
taste are becoming increasingly valuable. The next generation of
creative leaders will pair imagination with vision, courage, and
authenticity, serving not just as makers, but as curators,
strategists, and agents of change.

 HOW TO DESIGN THE RIGHT THING IN HIGH-PRESSURE SITUATIONS (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Designers often face pressure when product teams demand urgent
feature changes without providing context. These requests typically
stem from competitive threats, customer retention concerns, or both.
By asking strategic questions, designers can uncover the underlying
value proposition and assess whether competitors offer similar
features. Rather than accepting rushed directives, designers should
advocate for context upfront, as it leads to stronger, more efficient
design outcomes. 

 THE INFLUENCE OF FONT SIZE AND WEIGHT ON COGNITIVE LOAD (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Typography choices have a significant impact on cognitive load, with
font size and weight affecting how users perceive and process
information. Readability tends to be optimal between 17 and 161
points—extremes can disrupt flow and hinder comprehension. Font
weight shapes visual hierarchy but requires balance: too bold can
overwhelm, while too light can reduce legibility, especially on
mobile. These factors are critical for accessibility, as 16% of users
rely on clear, well-sized text that meets WCAG standards. 

 HERE'S HOW IPHONE 17 PRO WILL DIFFERENTIATE ITSELF FROM PREVIOUS
IPHONE MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The iPhone 17 Pro is expected to feature a significant redesign,
including a horizontal camera bar, an aluminum-infused back, and a
glass window for MagSafe, which will visually and physically
distinguish it from past models. Other anticipated upgrades include a
vapor chamber cooling system for better performance, a new 48MP
telephoto camera, and increased RAM.
