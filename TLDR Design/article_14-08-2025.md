 NEW IPHONE 17 AIR VIDEO REVEALS BEAUTIFUL SKY BLUE DUMMY MODEL (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Air will feature a Sky Blue color that
appears light and almost white in certain lighting. A new video of a
dummy model showcases the shade, previously a hit on the M4 MacBook
Air, from multiple angles, highlighting its appeal and the phone's
thin profile compared to the iPhone 16 Pro. 

 HERE'S A LOOK AT THE FINAL PEBBLE TIME 2 DESIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The upcoming Pebble Time 2, revealed by Core Devices CEO Eric
Migicovsky, features a stainless steel build, smaller bezels, a
flatter glass display, multicolor RGB backlighting, a second
microphone, a compass, and a 1.5-inch color e-paper touchscreen with
30-day battery life. Sleeker and more minimalist than past models, it
retains standard strap compatibility and will ship later this year,
with final color choices still open to fan input. 

 THE NEW PREVIEW APP HAS A FUN INTERACTIVE LIQUID GLASS EASTER EGG (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has hidden a playful Liquid Glass easter egg in the new Preview
app for iPadOS 26, available in developer beta 6. In the app, users
can interact with a fully rendered 3D loupe, mirroring the app icon,
which magnifies and distorts the interface beneath it as if it were
real glass, though it serves no practical function. This whimsical
addition highlights Apple's broader Liquid Glass design overhaul,
adding visual flair to system elements across the OS.

 DESIGNING WITH AI, NOT AROUND IT: PRACTICAL ADVANCED TECHNIQUES FOR
PRODUCT DESIGN USE CASES (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Advanced prompting techniques transform product design workflows by
structuring AI interactions to enhance research, ideation, and testing
processes. Practical methods include task decomposition, competitive
analysis, intellectual opposition, requirements generation, cognitive
walkthroughs, and cross-functional feedback simulation. Effective AI
collaboration requires designing better thinking processes rather than
simply writing improved instructions or using shortcuts. 

 DOES THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY HAVE AN AGEISM PROBLEM? (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Ageism in the creative industry often hides behind pay scales, hiring
biases, and age-restricted opportunities, leaving mid-career
professionals “too experienced” for junior roles but sidelined
from senior positions. While some over-40 creatives thrive through
strong networks, adaptability, and freelance independence, many face
ghosting, plausible deniability, and structural exclusion, despite the
industry's failure to recognize experience as a vital asset rather
than a liability. 

 FROM LINE TO LAYOUT: HOW PAST EXPERIENCES SHAPE YOUR DESIGN CAREER
(16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Even seemingly unrelated skills from years in fine dining—such as
reading subtle cues, managing timing under pressure, and crafting
impactful presentations—can translate directly into design work.
When balanced with intentionality, clear storytelling, and timely
pauses, these instincts become powerful tools that enhance creativity
and collaboration while avoiding potential drawbacks.

READ) [14] 

 ChatGPT5 promises significant improvements over version 4,
particularly in logical reasoning and coding through enhanced
