 Senior designers should improve their work with developers by not

much as possible.

MINUTE READ) [14] 

 One of the most significant differences between Western and Eastern
societies is how people view things ‚Äî Western nations focus more on
individual objects, while Eastern ones look more holistically. The

 AMBIENT CO-PRESENCE (8 MINUTE READ) [15]

obtrusive. Ambient co-presence is sharing a space or context with
others without directly interacting or continuously communicating with
them.
