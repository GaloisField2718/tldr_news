OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 I ASKED GOOGLE TO DESIGN ME AN APP UI AND IT DID - GOOGLE STITCH
FIRST LOOK (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 20-year-experienced UX/UI designer tested Google's Stitch, which
uses Gemini AI to generate UI and code from prompts. The tool
delivered basic designs that lacked style, had limited editing, and
struggled with flow and color accuracy. Exports to Figma and code were
decent, but image-based features were misaligned and outdated. The
designer called it half-baked, falling short of rivals like Figma's
First Draft. 

 CREATIVE RISK: CHARTING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PATH IN DESIGN (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Interdisciplinary design research focuses on meaningful meetings
through prep and follow-up, trust via transparent monthly updates, and
mentoring through examples over control. The future calls for
“π-shaped” designers with deep expertise in multiple areas and
adaptability in an AI-driven world. Success now means taking creative
risks and blending tech skills with leadership and empathy. 

 UX COPY SIZES: LONG, SHORT, AND MICRO (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Understanding the distinctions between long-form, short-form, and
microcopy is essential for designing clear, effective UX writing that
meets user needs. Each copy type serves a specific purpose—long-form
for complex detail, short-form for key ideas, and microcopy for quick
guidance. Knowing when to use them improves comprehension and
usability.
