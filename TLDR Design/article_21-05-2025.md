NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE MADE AN AI CODING TOOL SPECIFICALLY FOR UI DESIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Google has launched an experimental AI tool called Stitch, which uses
Gemini 2.5 Pro to convert text prompts and reference images into
functional UI designs and front-end code. Available through Google
Labs, Stitch enables developers to quickly generate multiple interface
variants and export them directly to apps or design platforms like
Figma. This move positions Stitch as a direct competitor to Figma's
recently announced Make UI tool, signaling Google's intent to retain
users within its own AI ecosystem. 

 ADOBE IS SWITCHING SOME CREATIVE CLOUD USERS TO A PRICIER AI PLAN (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe is renaming its Creative Cloud All Apps to Creative Cloud Pro
in North America and raising prices by $10 monthly starting June 17.
The new plan adds unlimited AI image credits and 4,000 video and audio
AI credits. Annual pricing jumps from $659.88 to $779.99. A cheaper
Standard plan with limited AI will remain for current users. Existing
subscribers will auto-switch to Pro on renewal. 

 MICROSOFT'S NLWEB PROJECT TURNS WEBSITES INTO CONVERSATIONAL
INTERFACES FOR AI AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft's NLWeb is an open project that turns websites into
conversational interfaces using natural language. Early adopters
include Shopify, TripAdvisor, and Eventbrite. Created by R.V. Guha, it
lets sites act as MCP servers for intelligent agents, enabling
features like personalized help and smart searches. Part of
Microsoft's vision shared at this year's Build conference, NLWeb aims
to boost agent accessibility without apps.

 THE USABILITY SCALING LAW: DEATH OF USER TESTING? (17 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 By 2035, AI trained on massive usability data could revolutionize
interface design, making predictive usability more effective than
traditional user testing for common cases. Today's usability insights
are scattered, but if unified and used to train AI, they could scale
like other AI systems. Though it may take 100,000 hours of annotated
research and cost hundreds of millions, the boost in UX productivity
could save billions each year. 

 THERE SHOULD BE NO AI BUTTON (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI button, often shown with vague icons like a magic wand, adds
confusion and disrupts workflows by separating AI from regular tasks.
As users grow more familiar with AI, this design will become outdated
and fragment work. A better solution is contextual integration—like
embedded AI teammates—that fit smoothly into workflows and allow
natural, real-time interaction without switching modes. 

 DESIGNERS ARE FACING UPSKILLING EXHAUSTION (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designer lethargy is rising as nonstop shifts in tools and trends
leave little time for rest or deep creativity. The fast pace, driven
by AI and social media, turns creativity into performance, where
staying visible feels essential. This pressure fuels burnout and
grief, disconnecting many from the joy of creating and challenging
their sense of identity and financial stability.

 THE GREATNESS TEST: WHAT IS YOUR BEST DESIGN WORK? (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Designers should rethink what “greatest work” means, as true
impact often lies beyond flashy projects. Most people need designs
that are affordable, convenient, and reliable—more than just
beautiful. Great design grows in cultures with shared values and
long-term commitment, which are rare. Real greatness is about using
your skills to tackle meaningful problems. 

 DUOLINGO'S SMALL UI SWITCH THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Duolingo replaced its punitive hearts with an energy system, using 25
units per lesson and rewarding bonus energy for correct answers. This
change reframes mistakes as investment, adds variable rewards, keeps
scarcity for monetization, and encourages more mistakes, which is key
for better language learning. 

 USING SIMULATION MODELS IN UX RESEARCH (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 UX research is facing strain, not from collapse, but from weak,
borrowed methods that lack depth as AI demands more predictive,
scalable insights. Adopting tools like simulation modeling from social
sciences can help researchers study complex behavior and guide
decisions when traditional access to users is limited.
