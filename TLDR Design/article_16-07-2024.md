 FROM GUI TO GEN AI (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The transition from text-based interfaces to GUIs in the 1980s
revolutionized computing by making it more accessible and
user-friendly, significantly expanding the tech industry. Generative
AI is the latest paradigm shift. It automates tasks and enhances
creativity in design, potentially transforming internet interactions. 

 WHAT FIGMA AI MEANS FOR DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma AI doesn't drastically alter design's trajectory as generative
AI tools were already promising. Concerns about training data
integrity are longstanding. The real issue is the potential
devaluation of design if it's reduced to basic tasks, so designers
should focus on strategic skills and confidently integrate AI into
their workflows.

 WHERE THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY IS HEADING, AND HOW TO SURVIVE THE NEXT
15 YEARS (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The creative industry is rapidly evolving due to technological
advancements, shifting work paradigms, and changing client
expectations. AI is set to reshape it, though specifics are
significantly uncertain. Human ingenuity will remain crucial, and
focusing on skills like empathy, critical thinking, and continuous
learning will help creatives stay relevant while thoughtfully

 THE MAKING OF ENO, THE FIRST GENERATIVE FEATURE FILM (15 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 "Eno" is a generative feature film about musician Brian Eno. It
offers a unique version for every screening based on 30 hours of
interviews and 500 hours of film, with 52 quintillion possible
variations. Created by director Gary Hustwit and digital artist
Brendan Dawes using Brain One software, the film is a "living
document" that can continually evolve and add new content. 

 AI IS NOT "DEMOCRATIZING CREATIVITY." IT'S DOING THE OPPOSITE (9
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Despite claims, AI isn't democratizing creativity - it's centralizing
power and wealth. Silicon Valley uses the buzz phrase, 'automating
jobs and exploiting creative labor,' to mask AI's true impact. The
narrative of AI leveling the playing field for artists is misleading,
as it undermines their livelihoods. True democratization would involve
compensating and seeking consent from creatives.
