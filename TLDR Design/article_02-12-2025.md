 OPENCV FOUNDERS LAUNCH AI VIDEO STARTUP TO TAKE ON OPENAI AND GOOGLE
(9 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CraftStory, founded by the creators of OpenCV, emerged from stealth
with $2 million in funding and technology that generates realistic,
human-centric videos up to 5 minutes long. The startup uses a
parallelized diffusion architecture that runs multiple algorithms
simultaneously across the entire video duration, trained on
proprietary high-quality footage rather than internet-scraped data.
CraftStory targets enterprise customers needing longer training videos
and product demonstrations, offering a video-to-video system that
animates still images using driving videos as motion templates. 

 AIGA NY UNVEILS NEW IDENTITY ROOTED IN COMMUNITY AND NEW YORK'S
CREATIVE ENERGY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AIGA NY has launched its first major rebrand in nearly 20 years,
introducing a new logo and strategy that emphasises community,
visibility, and open dialogue. Designed by Christopher Guerrero, the
identity creates a “town square” of negative space around the
classic AIGA box and uses colours inspired by New York's streets. The
chapter positions itself as a civic hub for designers and has
formalised three pillars—elevating diverse voices, celebrating
design excellence, and advocating for stronger industry standards—as
the refresh rolls out across its platforms. 

 WARNER MUSIC GROUP AND STABILITY AI JOIN FORCES TO BUILD THE NEXT
GENERATION OF RESPONSIBLE AI TOOLS FOR MUSIC CREATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Warner Music Group and Stability AI announced a partnership to
develop responsible AI music-creation tools using ethically trained
models that protect creators' rights while enabling new forms of
artistic expression. The collaboration will involve working directly
with artists to shape professional-grade tools that enhance creative
processes without compromising quality or artistic control. Stability
AI's commercially safe generative audio models, trained exclusively on
licensed data, will form the foundation for these artist-friendly
tools.

 CREATIVITY MEETS PRECISION WITH GOOGLE'S NANO BANANA PRO (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Google's Gemini 3 Pro with Nano Banana now integrates across Figma's
products, enabling designers to generate style variations and make
precise edits while preserving brand consistency and visual coherence.
The model excels at retaining design elements like palette, texture,
and composition when creating new directions, and handles challenging
tasks like adapting illustrations for dark mode or updating profile
photos to match existing styles. Users on paid Figma plans can access
Nano Banana Pro across all Figma products for contextual image
generation and refinement. 

 EXPOSURE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers limit their effectiveness by spending too much time with
other designers rather than engaging with product managers, engineers,
sales teams, and customers who possess crucial context on user needs
and business realities. Increased exposure to diverse perspectives
reveals insights that pure design skills cannot, enabling designers to
create solutions that actually solve the right problems. The most
creative and effective designers aren't just technically skilled, they
actively seek knowledge from people who understand different aspects
of the product, market, and user context. 

 APPLE JUST ACCIDENTALLY CHANGED THE FUTURE OF SMARTPHONE DESIGN (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The iPhone Air, despite its sleek design, has struggled with poor
sales and hardware compromises like limited battery life, a single
camera, and mono speakers, prompting several manufacturers—including
Xiaomi, Vivo, and Samsung—to cancel or freeze their own ultra-thin
phone projects. This suggests Apple's latest ultra-slim design may be
influencing the wider industry away from pursuing similar devices,
highlighting how even a visually striking gadget can have unintended
consequences when practicality falls short.

 THE HIDDEN COST OF SHIPPING TOO FAST (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 In many startups, teams prioritize speed without establishing shared
clarity about the problem being solved, leading to opinion-based
decision-making, weakened craft, and months of repair work that negate
any initial time savings. When clarity is absent, senior voices
dominate decisions, team energy shifts from momentum to maintenance,
and people lower their standards, choosing easier approaches rather
than better ones. The most effective teams distinguish between speed
(mere movement) and velocity (movement with direction), pausing to
align on "What problem am I solving, and for whom?" before building
anything. 

 UI AND UX DESIGN TRENDS FOR 2026: WHAT FOUNDERS AND DESIGNERS NEED TO
KNOW (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The digital design landscape in 2026 prioritizes outcome-driven UX
where usability, accessibility, and measurable business results trump
experimental aesthetics. Key shifts include UX teams proving tangible
business impact, large conferences declining in favor of continuous
internal learning, a return to familiar design conventions, regional
trends influencing global design, and new platforms like Apple Vision
Pro demanding new interface standards. AI integration has become
indispensable in modern workflows, while visual design emphasizes
cleaner, softer, more accessible interfaces with larger typography and
thoughtful contrast. 

 STRIPE'S MINIATURE, MOTORISED CITY IS A MODEL MARVEL AND TRIBUTE TO
THE HIDDEN WORLD OF COMMERCE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 For Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Giving Tuesday, Stripe created
“Stripe City,” an eight-foot-wide miniature city with over 100
figures, motorised elements, and interactive live data displays,
designed to visualise the complex flow of global commerce. Handcrafted
from paper, foam, and acrylics, the city combines physical diorama
charm with digital interactivity, offering a playful yet ambitious
celebration of Stripe's infrastructure and the companies that rely on
it, while livestreaming the experience for viewers during the busy
financial weekend.
