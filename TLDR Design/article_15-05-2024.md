 WHAT WE SHOULD LEARN FROM TOP HEALTHCARE APPS ABOUT SIGNUP AND
ONBOARDING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Top healthcare applications employ strategies to sign up and onboard
users effectively, converting them to paid subscriptions. These
strategies include building trust through clinical backgrounds and
data security practices, personalizing experiences based on user

value early, and implementing intelligent monetization tactics such as
non-intrusive paywalls with trial periods and transparent pricing. 

 HIDDEN VS. DISABLED IN UX (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Keeping features hidden harms discoverability, while disabling them
without explanation frustrates users. Turning off a feature is a good
idea if you want the user to understand that the feature exists but is
unavailable. By contrast, hide elements when the value is irrelevant
and can't be used. Don't hide buttons and filters by default, because
users expect them to persist.
