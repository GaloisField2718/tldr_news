 AN UPDATE ON OUR MAKE DESIGNS FEATURE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma temporarily disabled Figma AI's Make Designs feature after
discovering an issue that caused outputs to resemble existing apps.

 WHAT I LEARNED FROM MAKING MY OWN DESIGN SYSTEM (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems often struggle with understanding users' needs despite
knowing them. Creating a design system too late can be difficult,
especially when integrating it into an existing codebase. Using
minimal technology simplifies the process and reduces distractions.
Ensuring the design system aligns with users' goals helps reduce
deviations, and applying design system thinking to unify different
elements can improve efficiency and outcomes. 

 DITCH THE DESIGN PROCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A rigid design process may only suit some problems, necessitating
unique approaches and critical thinking to find the best solutions.
Janette Fuccella's Priority Framework, which emphasizes the importance
of selecting appropriate methods based on risk and problem knowledge,
offers a versatile toolbox for problem-solving.

 MASTER DESIGN SYSTEM GOVERNANCE WITH THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The key to mastering design system governance is simple: talk.
Conversation can save significant time and resources when questions,
issues, or concerns arise. Establishing a culture of open
communication through dedicated channels like Slack, office hours, and
email is crucial. Building rapport and proactively addressing concerns
enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the design system. 

 WE NEED MORE VITAMIN PRODUCTS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The "vitamin vs painkiller" analogy in startups distinguishes between
products that are nice-to-have enhancements (vitamins) and those that
solve immediate problems (painkillers). Painkillers address existing
issues, while vitamins, which gradually shift the focus from
problem-solving to embracing new, benefit-driven standards, require
patience and foresight. 

 HOW TO ARCHIVE YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 To effectively archive a design system, focus on preserving design
decisions rather than visual components. Document use cases, design
choices, and best practices to ensure valuable knowledge is retained.
Create an internal wiki with templates for each component, enabling
future designers to understand past decisions, maintain consistency,
and avoid redundant discussions, even if the original visual elements
are no longer used.
