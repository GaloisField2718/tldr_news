NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE IS STILL THE BEST BRAND IN THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO INTERBRAND'S
REPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Interbrand's 2025 Best Global Brands ranking keeps Apple, Microsoft,
Amazon, Google, and Samsung at the top. Nvidia saw record growth of
116%, while Instagram, YouTube, Uber, and Netflix also climbed.

 SPOTIFY PARTNERS WITH RECORD LABELS TO CREATE ‘ARTIST-FIRST' AI
MUSIC PRODUCTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Spotify partnered with major record labels—Sony, Universal, Warner,
and Merlin—to develop AI music products that respect copyright and
allow artists to opt in. The initiative follows criticism over
AI-generated content on the platform and recent policy changes to
reduce spam and label AI-assisted music. The company is establishing a
generative AI research lab to develop tools that enable artists to opt
in and receive compensation for their participation. 

 APPLE SUED, AGAIN, FOR ALLEGEDLY USING COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL TO TRAIN
ITS AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Two neuroscientists filed the second lawsuit in just over a month
against Apple, claiming the company trained its Apple Intelligence
models using pirated book collections, including their copyrighted
works. The lawsuit alleges Apple used Books3, a shadow library
containing over 190,000 pirated books, to train its OpenELM
model—the same dataset involved in other AI copyright cases. Apple
joins Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic in facing legal action over AI
training practices, while tech companies typically defend their use of
copyrighted material under the fair use doctrine.

 BURNOUT BY DESIGN – HOW TO PROTECT CREATIVES' PURPOSE AND PASSION
(11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Burnout in the creative industry has shifted from exhaustion to a
loss of curiosity and purpose, driven by systemic pressures,
unrealistic expectations, and AI-fueled pace. Once seen as a personal
weakness, it's now recognized as a structural issue. Leaders are urged
to promote balance and sustainable workloads, while many creatives
combat burnout by setting boundaries, diversifying work, and
protecting curiosity as their key creative asset. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRUST IN AI: WHY “RELYING ON AI” MATTERS MORE
THAN “TRUSTING IT” (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Psychology research reveals that trust in AI differs fundamentally
from trust in humans, activating different brain regions and requiring
a shift from "trust" to "reliance" in design thinking. While human
trust depends on empathy and shared intentions, AI reliance centers on
predictability, transparency, controllability, and consistent
performance—qualities that make it a dependable tool rather than a
social partner. For UX designers, this means measuring perceived
reliability and user control instead of applying traditional trust
frameworks, ensuring systems explain decisions clearly, admit errors,
and allow human override. 

 M5 IPAD PRO: THESE SURPRISE FEATURES MAKE A COMPELLING UPGRADE (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple's new M5 iPad Pro delivers far more upgrades than expected,
beyond the faster M5 chip. It adds 30% higher memory bandwidth, a
faster and more efficient C1X modem, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 6 via the
new N1 chip, fast charging, and 120Hz external display support. With
more RAM, better multitasking, and the nano-texture display option,
it's seen as a substantial and practical upgrade for users who rely on
the iPad Pro as their main device.

 GOOD DX ISN'T ENOUGH: WHY YOUR COMPONENT LIBRARY STILL FAILS YOUR
TEAM (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While good developer experience (DX) in component libraries provides
initial productivity gains, it fails to address critical long-term
challenges like consistency, maintainability, and team alignment.
Teams frequently switch UI kits chasing better DX, but the real
problems stem from inadequate governance, unclear ownership, technical
debt accumulation, and misalignment between library capabilities and
evolving product needs. Organizations should treat design systems as
products with clear goals, incremental adoption strategies, robust
governance structures, and continuous feedback loops rather than
pursuing the mythical "perfect DX." 

 HOLOGRAPHIK BUILT A SCALABLE IDENTITY FOR OPEN WORKS ON A TIGHT
TIMELINE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Holographik designed the Open Works festival identity around
practicality and clarity rather than visual spectacle. Using only
Helvetica in all caps and a single evolving “O” shape for motion,
the system balanced speed, scalability, and consistency across print,
digital, and environmental formats. Constraints drove simplicity,
transforming limitation into strength and avoiding typical festival
clichés. The adaptable framework proved both efficient and enduring,
setting a foundation for future editions while reinforcing
Holographik's focus on design culture and community. 

 HIDDEN PATTERNS OF SYSTEM BEHAVIOR (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Systems behave predictably based on their design, producing recurring
patterns called familiar system mechanisms (FSMs). Understanding
FSMs—such as balancing processes with delays, limits to growth, and
the tragedy of the commons—helps predict outcomes, anticipate common
failure modes, and identify leverage points. Feedback loops are
central, guiding adjustments and decision-making. Recognizing these
patterns allows individuals to navigate complexity, make smarter
choices, and work with systems rather than against them.
