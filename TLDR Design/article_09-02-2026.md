 HIGGSFIELD LAUNCHES ‘VIBE' EDITOR FOR CREATING MOTION GRAPHICS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Higgsfield's Vibe Motion is a no-code AI tool that enables
non-technical users to create professional motion graphics and
animations in about 10 minutes for $10 per video. The tool targets
small teams and solo founders, allowing them to produce marketing
animations, infographics, and dynamic logos that traditionally cost
$30,000 and take weeks to develop, positioning the company to become a
key marketing tool in the AI-native business workflow. Professional
plans start at $17.40 per month. 

 ROBLOX'S 4D CREATION FEATURE IS NOW AVAILABLE IN OPEN BETA (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Roblox has launched the open beta of its 4D creation feature, which
lets users generate interactive 3D objects that can move and respond
to players, moving beyond static models. The feature includes two
initial templates: "Car-5" for creating functional cars with spinning
wheels and "Body-1" for single-piece objects. Roblox plans to expand
the feature by allowing creators to build custom object behaviors and
is developing additional AI tools, including "real-time dreaming" for
world creation through text prompts. 

 IPHONE 18 PRO MAX'S NEW BATTERY GAINS REVEALED BY LEAKER (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Leaks suggest Apple plans to extend its battery-life lead with the
iPhone 18 Pro Max, boosting capacity to around 5000 mAh (SIM) or
nearly 5200 mAh (eSIM), up from the already class-leading iPhone 17
Pro Max. Combined with the more power-efficient A20 Pro chip and a
newer modem, Apple appears set to deliver even longer real-world
battery life despite only modest capacity gains.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNING BEYOND THE HAPPY PATH IN DESIGN SYSTEMS (9 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Designers typically focus on ideal "happy path" scenarios, but design
systems must account for real-world conditions such as loading delays,
errors, missing content, and diverse user needs. Design systems should
document technical states, build flexible components using container
queries, design inclusive interactions for various input methods, and
accommodate user preferences like zoom and offline modes. Early
collaboration between designers and developers, browser-based reviews,
and user research in their actual environments help create resilient
components. 

 THE RETURN OF THE INTUITIVE DESIGNER IN THE AGE OF AI (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Great designers stand out through intuition—tacit, experience-built
judgment that helps them navigate ill-defined problems and arrive at
elegant solutions—and this human skill is becoming more important as
AI automates process-driven, de-skilled parts of design. As tools get
better at producing outputs, designers who develop intuition through
experience, taste, understanding people and systems, and collaborative
play will be best equipped to choose, curate, and imagine genuinely
new solutions. 

 DESIGN CAREERS IN THE AGE OF AI: SPECIALIZE OR GENERALIZE? (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The rise of AI in digital design is triggering a crisis of
professional identity, as the apparent return of the “generalist”
risks replacing deep expertise with superficial, AI-generated outputs
that homogenize solutions and reduce innovation. The argument is not
against AI itself, but warns that real value comes from using AI to
deepen learning and cross-disciplinary understanding while preserving
strong professional trajectories, rather than outsourcing judgment,
thinking, and identity to probabilistic tools.

 ERIC BAILEY'S PREDICTIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF ACCESSIBILITY (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Organizations will adopt "performative accessibility" solutions that
focus on compliance rather than on removing barriers for users,
similar to how GDPR led to widespread cookie consent banners rather
than better privacy practices. The European Accessibility Act deadline
will drive demand for quick-fix accessibility tools, including
AI-powered solutions trained on largely inaccessible web code. This
approach prioritizes contractual compliance over genuine care for
users with disabilities, potentially widening the gap between
accessibility work and its real human impact. 

 NEW PHOTOSHOP INNOVATIONS IN 2026 PROVIDE A NON-DESTRUCTIVE WORKFLOW
SHIFT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Adobe's 2026 Photoshop update introduces non-destructive adjustment
layers called the "Texture Trinity" (Clarity, Dehaze, and Grain) that
enable maskable, reversible edits without disrupting the workflow. The
update includes Dynamic Text, which allows fluid text manipulation
along paths without complex vector workarounds. Firefly-powered AI
tools now generate 2K resolution output with improved fidelity and
fewer artifacts. 

 WILDISH & CO LIGHTENS UP PACKAGING FOR ETHICAL CHOCOLATE BRAND DIVINE
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 As cocoa prices rise, Divine Chocolate is leaning into premiumization
rather than reducing cocoa, refreshing its packaging with Wildish & Co
to better reflect its high cocoa content, Fairtrade roots, and farmer
co-ownership. The redesign uses bold, flavour-led colours,
illustrative farm scenes, and warmer typography to stand out on
shelves, differentiate flavours, and elevate the brand without
changing the product itself.
