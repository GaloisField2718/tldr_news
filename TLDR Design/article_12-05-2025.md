new 'Adobe lens' framing device. Inspired by Marva Warnock's original
'A' design, the update enhances flexibility and coherence while
spotlighting the Adobe name more confidently across platforms.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FIGMA SITES: WHEN ACCESSIBILITY IS AN AFTERTHOUGHT (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Figma Sites excited users with fast, expressive web design but raised
concerns over poor accessibility. Though it offers alt text and

showing a shift toward speed and looks over inclusivity and ethics. 

 SPICY(?) TAKES ON AI, DESIGN TESTS, AND COWARDICE (3 MINUTE READ) [8]


 AI does not threaten UX but reveals its flaws. Design tasks in hiring
show leadership insecurity, not candidate skill. Strong leaders trust
portfolios and dialogue. Real leadership shows in tough times, not
just when things are easy or profitable. 

 THE COMMERCIALISATION OF THE WORKING-CLASS CREATIVE (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Pentagram designer Harriet Richardson shifted from commercial design
to performance art, influenced by her working-class roots and northern
education. She critiques the class divide where southern privilege
allows risk while northern students focus on jobs. She urges
structural change to help working-class creatives explore art safely.
