 HOW TO CONSOLIDATE MULTIPLE DESIGN SYSTEMS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are four options for consolidating design systems: 1. Keep them
separate, which may lead to redundancy in research and development, 2.
Systems start sharing subsystems, which leads to efficiency gains but
challenges in alignment, 3. Systems retire, and a new one emerges, and
4. One system stays and others retire, streamlining operations but may
only meet some unique market segment needs.

 WHY IOS 18'S CUSTOMIZABLE HOME SCREEN LAYOUT IS A BIG DEAL (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Apple will finally let iOS users place app icons wherever they like
instead of forcing them into a strict grid. Users will now be able to
create groups of icons, which will vastly improve accessibility
through spatial memory. This will also be a large boon for anyone with
low vision ‚Äî it's easier to spot the right icon to tap if it is
surrounded by empty space and contrasts strongly with the background.
