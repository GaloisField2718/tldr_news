 OPENAI'S FIRST BIG CHATGPT CAMPAIGN SIGNALS A NEW ERA (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 OpenAI launched its first large-scale brand campaign, showcasing
everyday moments where ChatGPT quietly helps people achieve goals,
framed as “everyday magic” rather than a tech spectacle. Shot on
35mm film with an intimate, human-centered style, the campaign
reflects ChatGPT's growing role in daily life, timed alongside the
rollout of its new Pulse feature for real-time updates. 

 NEW TRUMP LOGO TORN TO SHREDS BY FEROCIOUS TRAVIS KELCE FANS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kai Trump, Donald Trump's granddaughter, faces backlash for her new
varsity-style “KT” logo merchandise, accused of copying Travis
Kelce's “TK” Tru Kolors logo. Fans on both sides have debated the
issue online, though neither party has commented, with comparisons
fueled by Kelce's established brand presence and previous logo
disputes. 

 FACEBOOK ADDS FAN CHALLENGES, CUSTOM BADGES FOR CREATORS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Facebook is introducing fan challenges that allow creators to prompt
followers to create reels or posts in response, with submissions
ranked on a leaderboard based on the number of reactions. The platform
will also enable creators to customize "top fan" badges that appear
next to the names of their most engaged followers. Meta tested fan
challenges over three months, generating 1.5 million entries, as it
pushes to make Facebook more creator-focused despite being better
known for community groups and AI-generated content.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 INTENT PROTOTYPING: THE ALLURE AND DANGER OF PURE VIBE CODING IN
ENTERPRISE UX (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The common mockup-centric design approach often leaves conceptual
models and user flows underdeveloped, creating a "lopsided horse"
problem that is particularly dangerous for complex enterprise
applications. AI-powered prototyping offers a potential solution, but
popular "vibe coding" methods encourage building without blueprints,
leading to structural ambiguities and broken conceptual models. A more
disciplined, intent-driven approach to prototyping is needed to bridge
the gap between design intent and live prototypes while maintaining
conceptual clarity. 

 DESIGN DIALECTS: BREAKING THE RULES, NOT THE SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Design systems should function as living languages that can adapt to
different contexts through "design dialects"—systematic variations
that maintain core principles while developing new patterns for
specific user needs. At Shopify, adapting the Polaris design system
for warehouse workers who wear thick gloves and work in low-light
conditions increased task completion, proving that contextual
flexibility serves users better than uniformity. The author advocates
for frameworks that tier components by flexibility (Consistent,
Opinionated, Flexible) and evaluate changes through user outcomes,
documenting deviations as legitimate dialects rather than exceptions,
because unity through shared principles beats uniformity through
cloned components. 

 HOW THE ILLUSTRATION INDUSTRY IS GRAPPLING WITH AI – A SPECIAL
REPORT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 About a quarter of illustrators have reported losing work to AI.
Industry surveys show declining fees, lost commissions, and rising
legal uncertainty over image use and copyright. While some
illustrators embrace AI as a creative aid, others see it as a threat,
citing plagiarism and lack of transparency. Agencies like Jacky Winter
are developing clear AI policies, while groups such as the Association
of Illustrators are pushing for stronger legal protections amid an
evolving, divisive landscape.

Awesome, including popover, slider, and scroller. 

 THE 10 FOUNDATIONAL UX PRINCIPLES EVERY DESIGNER SHOULD KNOW (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Ten essential UX principles separate intuitive digital experiences
from frustrating ones, emphasizing user-centered design over designer
preferences and prioritizing clarity, consistency, and feedback. Key
foundations include maintaining familiar patterns to build trust,
providing clear responses for every action, and designing for
accessibility as a fundamental requirement rather than an
afterthought. Effective UX is iterative and context-aware. It is
ultimately about respecting users' time and intelligence through
thoughtful design choices that treat people well.
