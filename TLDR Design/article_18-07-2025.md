NEW (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple has redesigned its TV app for iOS 26 and tvOS 26, introducing a

controls with a more transparent, immersive look. The update also

to show more titles on-screen, and a refreshed app icon. These changes
aim to improve both the visual appeal and functionality of the app
ahead of major Apple TV+ content releases this fall.

 UX JOB INTERVIEW HELPERS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Comprehensive resources and strategies for UX job interview
preparation include practical guides, templates, and strategic
question lists to help candidates prepare effectively. Key
recommendations emphasize telling impactful stories about the business
value of design work, asking strategic questions about team challenges
and company direction, and using the STAR method when presenting
examples. Rejection often reflects company circumstances rather than
candidate shortcomings, encouraging persistence in the job search
process. 

 TYRANNY OF OPTIONALITY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A 2010 Harvard study found that people experience greater happiness
when focusing on current activities rather than letting their minds
wander to other possibilities. This principle applies strongly to
high-potential tech professionals who suffer from constant career
optionality, mentally living in alternate career timelines instead of
committing to their present roles. The research suggests that being
present and committed to one's current career path generates more
satisfaction than continually evaluating imaginary alternatives, even
when those alternatives seem more appealing. 

 GENERALPUBLIC STUDIO DRAWS FROM FRENCH APOTHECARY LEGACY IN ITS
BOTANICAL IDENTITY FOR APOTICARI (3 MINUTE READ) [9]

blends traditional apothecary aesthetics with a modern sensibility.
Drawing on the Hôtel-Dieu's heritage of botanical care for pilgrims,
the design combines expressive and neutral typography, custom plant
illustrations, disciplined layouts, and natural-toned materials to
create packaging that feels both authentic and contemporary.

 HOW TO INTEGRATE AI AGENTS INTO YOUR UX RESEARCH PROCESS (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 AI agents can enhance UX research by automating time-consuming tasks
like participant recruitment, data transcription, and analysis while
preserving human insights and quality. These tools support the entire
research process, from planning and data collection to generating
insights and creating reports, enabling teams to work more efficiently
without compromising research integrity. Success requires maintaining
human oversight, prioritizing data ethics, and using AI as a
collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human researchers.


 HOW WILL AI IMPACT THE NEXT GENERATION OF DESIGNERS? (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini will fundamentally reshape design
for future generations who grow up with these tools as standard.
Current AI image generators already compete with human artists, while
raising concerns about whether new designers will learn fundamental
principles of color, typography, and accessibility. The technology may
increase productivity, but could reduce creative control, transforming
designers into prompt engineers rather than creative professionals who
perfect details and guide project direction.
