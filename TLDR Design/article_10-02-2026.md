 JONY IVE FERRARI INTERIOR MIGHT BE A GLIMPSE OF THE APPLE CAR THAT
NEVER WAS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Jony Ive reportedly spent years designing the interior of Apple's
cancelled car project, and the new Ferrari Luce—created by his firm
LoveFrom—may hint at what that vision looked like. The cockpit
features Ive's signature design language of precise circles and
“squircles,” extensive use of Gorilla Glass and anodized aluminum,
and playful details like an E Ink key that symbolically “transfers
life” to the car. 

 CANVA NOW LETS CHATGPT CREATE DESIGNS THAT MATCH YOUR BRAND DESIGN
AND LOGO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Canva has integrated with ChatGPT to automatically create designs
that match users' brand colors, fonts, and logos through the Canva
Brand Kit. The integration includes features like Guided Presentation
Builder and Live Design Preview, allowing users to see and edit
designs directly within ChatGPT. This eliminates the need for manual
editing after AI generation, enabling users to go from idea to branded
design without design expertise. 

 MITO AI RAISES $4.5M TO EMPOWER VIDEO PROFESSIONALS WITH AI TOOLS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mito AI raised $4.5 million in funding led by Lightspeed Venture
Partners to develop AI orchestration tools for video professionals.
The platform offers browser-based collaborative tools that integrate
AI and audio models with professional editing capabilities, allowing
filmmakers and creative professionals to work together in real-time.
Mito competes with other AI video platforms from companies like Adobe,
Google, and various startups by focusing on a directing-style
experience rather than simple editing or prompting.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE CONTENT IS KING (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There's no single correct portfolio format—PDFs, websites, Figma
links, and even Instagram can all work—because agencies care most
about the quality of the projects, not the platform. Designers should
choose the format that best showcases their work (especially motion),
keep layouts simple and accessible, and focus on strong presentation,
clear rationale, and polished details rather than overcomplicating the
delivery method. 

 THE OPEN SOURCE DESIGN STACK (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design tooling is dominated by SaaS monopolies like Figma, which
force users into expensive subscription models and unwanted AI
features. There are open source alternatives that match professional
quality standards while avoiding the extractive SaaS ecosystem.
However, open source tools aren't perfect solutions and come with
their own set of problems and inconsistencies.

websites from a single prompt. Featuring structured design systems
that scale over time, the tool generates sites with consistent

scalable sites quickly without sacrificing structure or consistency.

 STANDARD PROJECTS TURNS TEMPORAL LOGIC INTO IDENTITY FOR SINGLESTORE
(5 MINUTE READ) [14]

around the idea “The Time Is Now” that embeds temporal precision
into the logo, typography, imagery, and motion system. The result
balances technical speed with human impact, shifting focus from data
performance itself to the real-world moments it enables, and
expressing permanence, maturity, and emotional resonance through
restrained typography, deeper colours, and time-inspired visual logic.


 CREATIVES REVEAL HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT 2026 SO FAR (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Creatives are experiencing mixed emotions about 2026, with some
cautiously optimistic about work picking up while questioning if this
optimism is real or collective wishful thinking. Many report more
projects in January compared to previous years, though uncertainty
remains about whether this trend will continue. Political and economic
pressures continue to cast shadows over the creative industry, with
some professionals feeling exhausted by external forces beyond their
control.
