 APPLE IS PLANNING SOMETHING BIG FOR ITS 50TH BIRTHDAY (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Apple will celebrate its 50th birthday on April 1. CEO Tim Cook has
promised "some celebration" during an internal company meeting. The
details remain unclear, and it's uncertain whether this will be an
employee-only event or include public festivities. Apple may release
special anniversary accessories, such as themed Apple Watch bands or
iPhone cases, though the company could also launch something bigger
for this milestone. 

 EU SAYS TIKTOK'S 'ADDICTIVE DESIGN' LIKELY VIOLATES THE LAW, WILL
NEED TO CHANGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The European Commission issued preliminary findings that TikTok's
addictive features, like infinite scroll, autoplay, and personalized
algorithms, likely violate EU Digital Services Act regulations
designed to protect users, especially minors. Regulators claim TikTok
failed to assess how these design choices harm users and ignored
warning signs of compulsive behavior among children using the app late
at night. If confirmed, TikTok could face fines up to 6% of its global
revenue and must make design changes. 

 STUDIO DISPLAY 2 COMING SOON WITH AT LEAST FOUR BIG CHANGES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly preparing to release the Studio Display 2 soon.
It will have a similar design but notable internal upgrades, including
a higher refresh rate (90Hz or 120Hz), an A19 chip, mini-LED
backlighting, and HDR support. The update is expected in the first
half of the year, though pricing and connectivity details remain
unknown.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT TOOL DESIGN AND AI (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Current AI tools poorly align with good tool design principles: they
exhibit high latency with multi-second waits, require text
descriptions rather than hands-on control, and impose usage costs or
limits. Emerging tools like real-time video manipulation models offer
a contrast by allowing immediate interaction, being open-source, and
enabling users to shape outputs directly. AI tooling should evolve
toward faster, more directly manipulable systems that reduce the gap
between user intent and execution, particularly as local models
improve. 

 HOW GENERATIVE AI IS REDEFINING BRAND IDENTITY SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Generative AI is transforming brand identity from rigid, fixed assets
into flexible systems that adapt across contexts. Designers are
shifting from crafting individual assets to becoming system architects
who define constraints, behaviors, and brand logic. Successful
implementation requires establishing a clear core brand DNA, defining
what stays fixed and what is flexible, building governance early, and
addressing ethical considerations around bias and inclusivity. 

 UX DESIGNERS DON'T NEED TO BE DATA SCIENTISTS — BUT THEY MUST
CHALLENGE DATA (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX designers today must understand data and metrics to connect their
design work to business impact, beyond just creating intuitive user
experiences. They must be able to interpret analytics, question data
findings, and understand when quantitative metrics don't align with
qualitative user research. The role has evolved from focusing solely
on usability to requiring collaboration with data teams and the
ability to challenge data when it doesn't tell the complete user
story.

 HOW TYPOGRAPHY HIERARCHY BOOSTS UI USABILITY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Typography hierarchy organizes text by importance through size,
weight, color, spacing, and position, enabling users to scan
interfaces efficiently. An effective hierarchy reduces cognitive load,
improves scannability, supports faster decision-making, and enhances
accessibility. Common mistakes include using too many font sizes,
overusing emphasis, inconsistent styling, poor contrast, and
inadequate spacing.
