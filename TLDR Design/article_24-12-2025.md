NEWS & TRENDS

 LUMA RELEASES A NEW AI MODEL THAT LETS USERS GENERATE A VIDEO FROM A
START AND END FRAME (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Luma AI released Ray3 Modify, a new model that enables users to
generate videos from start-to-end frames while modifying existing
footage using character reference images that preserve the original
performance. The model allows creative studios to transform human
actors' appearances while retaining motion, timing, and emotional
delivery, available through Luma's Dream Machine platform. This
release follows Luma's $900 million funding round led by Saudi
Arabia's Humain in November, with plans to build a 2GW AI cluster
there. 

 CHATGPT LAUNCHES A YEAR-END REVIEW LIKE SPOTIFY WRAPPED (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT is rolling out a Spotify Wrapped–style annual review called
“Your Year with ChatGPT” for eligible free, Plus, and Pro users in
select English-speaking markets who have chat history and saved
memories enabled. The optional, privacy-forward feature uses
personalized visuals, awards, and creative outputs like poems and
images to reflect how individuals used ChatGPT over the year, and is
available on web and mobile. 

 ALIBABA'S QWEN RELEASES AI MODEL THAT SPLITS IMAGES INTO EDITABLE
LAYERS LIKE PHOTOSHOP (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Alibaba's Qwen has released an AI model that automatically splits
images into separate editable layers with transparent backgrounds,
similar to Photoshop's layer system. The model allows users to
independently resize, reposition, recolor, or replace individual
elements, such as backgrounds, people, or objects, across 3 or 8
layers. Code and demos are available on GitHub, Hugging Face, and
ModelScope for testing.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY AI IS EXPOSING DESIGN'S CRAFT CRISIS (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI design tools exposed a technical literacy crisis that has been
eroding designers' strategic influence since the early 2010s, when the
industry collectively decided that designers don't need technical
knowledge. When tools like Figma AI and Figma Sites launched with
serious flaws, many designers couldn't evaluate whether outputs were
functional or broken. Designers who maintain strategic relevance
understand technical systems deeply enough to participate in product
decisions, evaluate AI-generated work, and advocate for users in
technical conversations. 

 WHY AI PRODUCTS FAIL WITHOUT PROPER UX? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many AI products fail because of a disconnect between their
technological capabilities and user experience design, with 42% of
businesses struggling due to poor market fit. The core issues include
AI's "black box" nature, automation bias, blank-canvas paralysis from
unclear guidance, workflow friction, hallucinations, and a lack of
feedback loops for improvement. Good UX design can address these
failures by positioning AI as an assistant rather than an expert,
using confidence scores and transparency measures, providing templates
and suggestions, ensuring seamless integration, acknowledging
imperfection, and implementing user feedback systems. 

 THE ART OF VIBE DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI has collapsed the gap between idea and execution, making it
possible to build polished, expressive products through conversation
alone, without traditional design or coding skills. The new bottleneck
is taste: clear vision, judgment, and the ability to articulate what
“feels right,” with AI acting as a force multiplier rather than a
creative substitute.

 SIX SURPRISING ILLUSTRATION TRENDS FOR 2026 (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Industry professionals predict that illustration in 2026 will
emphasize handcrafted techniques such as woodblock printing and
linocut, while artists bring authentic, personal perspectives
reflecting diverse cultural experiences. Realism must evolve beyond
technical accuracy to incorporate unique concepts, atmospheres, and
emotional resonance that AI cannot replicate. The field calls for
experimental aesthetics using new technologies, positivity-focused
imagery, and vibrant color palettes featuring neon hues and bold
combinations. 

 AI IMAGE GENERATORS RESORT BACK TO THE SAME 12 PHOTO STYLES, STUDY
CALLS IT ‘VISUAL ELEVATOR MUSIC' (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers found that when AI image models repeatedly generate and
re-describe images, they rapidly converge on a small set of generic
visual styles regardless of the original prompt. Across thousands of
runs, outputs consistently settled into about a dozen recurring
motifs, which the authors liken to bland, stock “visual elevator
music.”
