NEWS & TRENDS

 BING LETS YOU USE OPENAI'S SORA VIDEO GENERATOR FOR FREE (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's Sora video generator into its Bing
mobile app, offering free access without requiring a ChatGPT
subscription. The Bing Video Creator allows users to generate
five-second vertical videos through text descriptions, with standard
and fast generation options available. The feature is rolling out
globally to Android and iPhone Bing apps, with desktop support coming
later. While the video quality shows limitations compared to
competitors like Google's Veo 3, it provides accessible AI video
generation for mobile users. 

 CHATBOT PLATFORM CHARACTER.AI UNVEILS VIDEO GENERATION, SOCIAL FEEDS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Character.AI has launched multimedia features, including AvatarFX
video generation, which allows users to create talking videos of AI
characters with custom voices and dialogue. The platform introduced
Scenes and Streams for collaborative storytelling and a social feed
for sharing character-generated content. While Character.AI blocks
real people's photos and watermark videos, concerns remain about
potential deepfake abuse, given the company's history of safety
issues. The features expand beyond the platform's original text-based
chatbot format to offer more interactive character experiences. 

 GOOGLE QUIETLY PAUSED THE ROLLOUT OF ITS AI-POWERED ‘ASK PHOTOS'
SEARCH FEATURE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has paused the rollout of its AI-powered “Ask Photos”
feature due to concerns over latency, quality, and user experience.
The tool, which uses a custom version of Google's Gemini AI, was
designed to help users search their photo libraries using natural
language queries, but is being refined after underwhelming
performance. This marks another instance of Google halting AI features
shortly after launch, reflecting ongoing challenges in deploying
reliable AI tools amid intense industry competition.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO “BREAK” YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM RULES WITHOUT CREATING CHAOS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design systems should serve as flexible frameworks rather than rigid
rulebooks, with effective rule-breaking requiring a deep understanding
of underlying principles and collaborative governance. Modern
organizations are shifting from "Pattern Police" to "Empathic
Sherpas," who treat design systems as evolving infrastructures
accommodating thoughtful innovation. Successful rule-breaking involves
structured contribution models, transparent processes, and
collaborative frameworks that turn deviations into systematic
improvements. 

 REINVENT THE WHEEL (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While often well-intentioned, the advice to "not reinvent the wheel"
can stifle curiosity and hinder deep learning, especially in fields
like software engineering, where rebuilding foundational tools fosters
true understanding. By exploring, experimenting, and even failing,
individuals not only learn how systems work but also uncover new
possibilities, making reinvention a valuable path to both personal
growth and innovation. 

 ARE SOCIAL MEDIA PILE-ONS STIFLING THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY? (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The backlash to GF Smith's rebrand highlights how social media
criticism in the design industry can quickly shift from constructive
debate to toxic, personal attacks—often fueled by unrealistic
standards and hidden biases around race, class, and tradition. While
open critique is vital, unchecked negativity risks discouraging bold
creative decisions and ultimately harms the industry by making clients
afraid to innovate.

 HOW TO CREATE AN IMPRESSIVE PRODUCT DESIGN PORTFOLIO (8 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Product design portfolios are essential for job applications, with
90% of hiring managers requiring strong portfolios from entry-level
candidates. A quality portfolio should include 1-5 case studies
showcasing your design process, a home page, an about section, and
contact information on a professional website. Each case study should
tell the project story from research to the final product, starting
with the polished result to create an immediate impact. 

 THE DEATH OF WEB DESIGN: WHY WEBSITES WILL SOON AUTO-DESIGN
THEMSELVES (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI-powered websites will soon design themselves in real time,
adapting layouts, copy, and user experiences based on live performance
data rather than static design decisions. Traditional web design roles
will shift from pixel-pushing to systems thinking, with designers
becoming "experience composers" who set behavioral rules and ethical
boundaries for AI optimization. The future web will feature dynamic
experiences that morph based on user context, behavior, and
performance metrics, making static design files obsolete. 

 AI IS COMING FOR OUR DESIGN JOBS, BUT IT CAN'T TOUCH TASTE (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 While AI is accelerating design processes and may threaten
entry-level roles, it cannot replicate human discernment, taste, or
the ability to make intentional, context-driven design decisions. As
the industry evolves, designers who cultivate critical thinking,
creativity, and a strong point of view will remain valuable in a
landscape where human-centered design still matters.
