 PINTEREST'S ‘TUNER' LETS YOU DIAL DOWN THE AMOUNT OF AI CONTENT —
BUT NOT ENTIRELY (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pinterest has introduced a "tuner" feature that allows users to
reduce AI-generated content in their feeds across categories like
beauty, art, fashion, and home decor, though the platform doesn't
guarantee complete elimination of AI content. The tool, found in
settings under "refine your recommendations," is now available on
Android and desktop, with iPhone access coming soon. This follows
Pinterest's May rollout of "AI modified" labels on pins, which the
company says it's making more noticeable alongside enhanced detection
capabilities. 

 PUSH MAKE PROJECT TO GITHUB (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new feature allows Figma users to push Make projects directly to
new GitHub repositories, enabling code backup and version history
tracking. The functionality, rolling out this week, lets users
continue development in their preferred tools. Users can push ongoing
updates from Make to GitHub whenever they make changes to their
projects. 

 THESE PRETTY NEW NEST LEARNING THERMOSTAT FACES WILL TURN YOUR
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLER INTO A WORK OF ART (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has released a new set of animated faces for the Nest Learning
Thermostat, including a botanical series created by illustrator
Mathilde Loubes that changes monthly to reflect the seasons. These new
designs, along with minimalist and classic options, aim to make the
thermostat blend more seamlessly into home decor while maintaining
core functionality like displaying temperature and time.

 WHAT PERPLEXITY'S AI BROWSER REVEALS ABOUT UX'S FUTURE (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Perplexity's Comet browser demonstrates a fundamental shift from
navigation-based to intention-based interfaces, where users state
goals in natural language rather than manually navigating to
information. Testing revealed users mentally adapt to this paradigm
within days, even though current AI reliability remains at 60-70%. The
research suggests that the competitive future lies not in monolithic
AI systems, but in specialized AI services that collaborate through
shared intention contexts. This requires designers to prioritize
transparent failure communication and cross-platform intention
continuity over traditional engagement metrics. 

 DEFAULT ISN'T DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Framework monoculture persists partly through System Justification
Theory—a psychological reflex where people defend existing
arrangements as legitimate even when harmful, driven by desires for
certainty, safety, and group belonging. This manifests in front-end
development through dismissive language about standards and false
tradeoffs between shipping and interoperability, quietly accumulating
costs like reduced portability, slower innovation, and user-shifted
burdens. A standards-first approach offers a pragmatic path that
preserves developer experience while ensuring work remains lean,
portable, and future-proof across teams and platforms. 

 THE ILLUSION OF ALIGNMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People often believe they're aligned when using the same words, but
each person imagines something different. Visual thinking—through
sketches and prototypes—reveals these hidden differences early,
turning abstract ideas into shared understanding and preventing
miscommunication before it derails collaboration.

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR UX RESEARCH HARD TO IGNORE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Strong research alone doesn't drive change because it often exposes
uncomfortable truths about internal failures and poor decisions that
organizations resist acknowledging. When quantitative and qualitative
data conflict, teams must reconcile differences by identifying gaps
and cross-validating findings through triangulation rather than
dismissing either perspective. Effective UX research requires wrapping
data in compelling narratives that unite stakeholders around shared
goals, demonstrate viable solutions, and present an achievable path
forward that people can commit to. 

 PROTECT YOUR PEACE: A BURNOUT SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR CREATIVE
PROFESSIONALS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Burnout is prevalent in creative industries, where professionals
often push themselves beyond healthy limits. Recognizing early warning
signs like task fatigue and physical tension can help prevent it. Key
strategies include learning to say no, establishing clear boundaries
around work hours and rest, and building reflection time into projects
rather than chasing constant productivity. Three emerging techniques
show promise for burnout prevention: focusing on one color during
walks to anchor attention, lying down to activate the parasympathetic
nervous system, and alternating between brisk and slower walking
intervals. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF FIVE OF ADOBE'S ICONIC ICONS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Icon design is a blend of art, psychology, and cultural awareness —
each symbol must clearly convey meaning while evolving with technology
and user expectations. Adobe's long history with icons like the floppy
disk, eye, magic wand, pen, and crop tool shows how thoughtful
iteration, abstraction, and testing turn small visuals into timeless
design language that balances clarity, consistency, and emotion.
