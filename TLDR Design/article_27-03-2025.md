 HOW KINSTA HELPS ATOMIC SMASH DELIVER WORDPRESS SITES UP TO 91%
FASTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Web development agency Atomic Smash focuses on improving existing
websites rather than building new ones. As their client list expanded,
managing their own servers became a burden, taking time and money away
from what clients really care about: great website experiences.

Needing a change, Atomic Smash discovered Kinsta [5], a premium
managed WordPress hosting provider.

→ No more server setup, updates or security worries, Kinsta takes
care of it all.

→ Kinsta runs uptime checks every 3 minutes (that's 480 per day!)
and backs it all with a 99.9% uptime guarantee.

→ Simply migrating to Kinsta [6] made client sites up to 91% faster,
no manual tuning required.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LEADERSHIP OVER MEASURESHIP (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 "Measureship" prioritizes efficiency and metrics over human
experience, leading to stagnation and brand decline. Using a
leadership-driven approach instead, focused on empathy, qualitative
insights, and innovation, fosters long-term success. 

 SEVEN WAYS TO DRIVE DESIGN INNOVATION (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Strategies to help design teams and enhance creativity include
simplifying, solving the right problem, and designing for emotional
impact. Examples like FXI's X-Mask and Henchman's Tripod Ladder show
how these approaches drive innovation and create meaningful products. 

 COMPOSITE VS SIMPLE TOKENS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In design systems, composite tokens group multiple simple tokens to
define complex elements like typography styles, shadows, and borders.
They enhance consistency, simplify maintenance, and ensure updates
propagate system-wide. Unlike simple tokens, composite tokens
encapsulate higher-level concepts and depend on atomic values. They
exist at semantic or component-specific tiers within a design system.

 COMPLAINING ABOUT DESIGNERS FIDDLING WITH FIGMA SOLVES NOTHING (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Designers should understand their medium, but collaboration with
engineers is key. Clear, detailed handoffs help prevent usability and
accessibility issues. Prototyping in design tools catches problems
early, saving time and costs. Instead of an "us vs. them" mindset,
teams should focus on communication to create better, more functional
digital products.

perfection. Failure is part of the process, and collaboration fosters
better results. Creativity thrives on play, rest fuels productivity,

techniques, drive meaningful creative breakthroughs.
