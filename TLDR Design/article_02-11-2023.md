 AN INSIDE LOOK AT FOUR DESIGN DETAILS IN OUR NEW PIXEL DEVICES (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Part of the design for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro includes the
introduction of a new blue shade called Bay, a striking hue that came
from a color strategy developed during the pandemic. The matte back is
back and it gives the devices a subtle grip and silky feel and is
great at preventing fingerprints. The Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are also less
boxy than their predecessors, with thinner bezels to reveal more of
the glass display. 

 GOODBYE, TOUCH BAR, YOU HELD INCREDIBLE PROMISE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 When the Touch Bar launched, it felt like touching the future. It was
an OLED strip that recognized touch and replaced the function row of
keys on the 2016 MacBook Pro. The problem was the Touch Bar never
quite got out of the proof-of-concept phase, despite being in the
majority of MacBook Pros made between late 2016 and 2019. Due to its
low interest among developers and low usage among Apple‚Äôs laptop
users, the TouchBar has been discontinued in the new line of MacBooks.


 HANDS ON WITH THE APPLE TV APP REDESIGN IN TVOS 17.2 (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The tvOS 17.2 beta introduces a redesigned Apple TV app that focuses
on Channels and app navigation. The update includes a new sidebar with
improved content sorting, dedicated pages for Channels and apps, and a
more integrated experience for services like Disney+. While some apps
like Netflix still operate separately, the redesign aims to enhance
ease of use and encourage more apps to join Apple TV Channels, making
Channels and apps more equal within the TV app ecosystem.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 USE THE ACCESSIBILITY SHORTCUTS ON IOS TO SPEED UP YOUR TESTING
WORKFLOW (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Switching VoiceOver and Voice Control is cumbersome if you are in the
process of testing an app or website. Siri can make this easier. You
can invoke VoiceOver by using the command ‚ÄúHey Siri, VoiceOver
on‚Äù. Switching VoiceOver off works by issuing ‚ÄúHey Siri, VoiceOver
off.‚Äù These and other accessibility features can also be enabled by
a shortcut, from the control center, with a back tap, or with the
action button. 

 PIXELS OF INFLUENCE: BREAKING DOWN PERSUASIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People make thousands of decisions every day, with some sources
suggesting upwards of 35,000 decisions per day, though this number is
somewhat suspect as it is difficult to estimate something predicated
on personal bias. Understanding how and why people interact with
products and employing persuasive design principles based on that
information can ease decision-making anxiety and improve overall user
experience. 

 A MORE FOCUSED, PRODUCTIVE SLACK (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The design team at Slack explored many different concepts and
approaches to improve user focus, including a literal focus mode. In
the end, the optimal tab set included Messages, Activity, and Later.
They kept the number of tabs as small as possible, requiring that each
addition provide a place to focus on a certain task.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DOORDASH NOW WARNS YOU THAT YOUR FOOD MIGHT GET COLD IF YOU DON‚ÄôT
TIP (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In 2019, DoorDash restructured its payments to drop the controversial
‚Äútipped wage‚Äù method and pay a base rate with 100 percent of tips
going to drivers. However, this resulted in orders without tips being
less appealing to drivers. DoorDash has added a pop-up in its app
warning customers that orders with no tip might take longer to get
delivered. According to DoorDash, this is something that it's
currently testing to help create the best possible experience for all
members of its community. 

 CANVA LAUNCHES AI TOOLS FOR EDUCATION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Magic Write is a generative AI tool that allows students and teachers
to access quick actions from a dropdown menu, including summarizing
text, expanding short text into longer formats, rewriting text, and
changing the tone. Another feature, Magic Animate, allows students and
teachers to turn static text into moving text and automatically add
transitions to presentations. Magic Grab automatically detects
separate elements and objects within an image ‚Äî say text within a
classroom handout or diagrams ‚Äî and lets the user automatically
move, resize, and reposition them, even if they were not separate
elements to begin with.
