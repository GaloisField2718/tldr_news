initially reported by Ars Technica and later fixed by Apple, though
the specific iOS version containing the fix was not disclosed. Despite
solid evidence from multiple sources, Apple recently denied the
existence of the issue in a formal response to the UK's Competition
and Markets Authority (CMA), leading to accusations that the company
was potentially misleading regulators. 

 GOOGLE EXPANDS AI-POWERED VIRTUAL TRY-ON TOOL TO INCLUDE DRESSES (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has expanded its generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool to
include dresses, allowing users to try on thousands of dresses from
brands like Boden and Staud virtually. Dresses, a highly searched
category, pose a challenge for traditional diffusion techniques due to
their intricate details and varied lengths. To overcome this, Google
developed a new training strategy and built the VTO-UNet Diffusion
Transformer (VTO-UDiT), which maintains body details while accurately
displaying dresses. This advanced tool aims to improve the virtual
shopping experience.
