 HERE‚ÄôS HOW THE APPLE ANTITRUST SUIT COULD CHANGE IPHONE DESIGN (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 An antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against Apple
may result in significant changes to the iOS experience. There might
be some similarities with what happened after the company had to
conform to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) in promoting
its services, running its App Store, and handling contactless
payments. The main changes in the EU include adding options for
downloading apps from other app stores inside iOS and more web
browsing options besides Safari. 

 TENNESSEE JUST BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO PROTECT MUSICIANS AND OTHER
ARTISTS AGAINST AI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tennessee is the first state to enact legislation to protect
songwriters, performers, and others in the music industry against the
potential dangers of artificial intelligence. AI tools won't be
allowed to replicate artists' voices without their consent beginning
July 1. People can potentially face civil action if they use AI
techniques to reproduce an artist's name, likeness, or voice without
permission.

 GENERATIVE UI AND OUTCOME-ORIENTED DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generative User Interfaces (genUI) will create customized user
interfaces in real time, shifting the design approach towards
outcome-oriented design where user goals are prioritized. This future
technology will provide highly personalized tailor-made interfaces.
While current AI-assisted design tools speed up the design process,
they have limitations compared to genUI's potential impact. 

 WHEN AND HOW TO MOVE FROM AN ASSUMPTION TO A HYPOTHESIS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 An assumption is a guess or thing you work on with the belief that
it‚Äôs true. A (good) hypothesis doesn‚Äôt come with any belief.
It‚Äôs an idea or statement you use as a starting point to prove or
disprove a position. Translating assumptions into hypotheses reduces
risk and builds a learning pattern. 

 SOCIAL PROOF (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 By nature, word-of-mouth contains a high degree of authenticity and
credibility. Consumers are 77% more likely to buy a product if their
friends recommend it. This case study looks into how designers can use
social proof to increase product usage.

 WHY WE CRAVE HEALTHIER COMPUTING (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The history of computing has seen an increase in the number of
decisions users must make when designing their computing experience,
leading to a more significant burden on the user. Users now question
modern computer benefits due to distractions, addiction, and lack of
constraints, seeking technology that limits and guides behavior.
Remarkable and the Daylight tablet balances a perfect combination of
versatility and constraint. 

 CRAFTING RESILIENCE: A DEEP DIVE INTO LIQUID TYPOGRAPHY DESIGN (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Laura Dillema's project, Thrive Amidst Chaos, is a prime example of
how designers can communicate complex themes through the meticulous
craft of typography. Handcrafted with acrylic paint and precise
lighting, the black acrylic paint flows, drips, and splashes across
the canvas, forming the words "Thrive Amidst Chaos" in a chaotic and
controlled manner. The design process shows the artists' impressive
understanding of how materials interact, how light plays with texture,
and how audiences will emotionally connect with the result.
