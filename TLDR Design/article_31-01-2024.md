 YELP LAUNCHES REVAMPED FEED WITH AI-POWERED BUSINESS SUMMARIES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Yelp has revamped its home page for businesses, brought in a better
onboarding process with budget recommendations, and provided a way to
schedule advertising consultations. The company is rolling out a new
search experience that will show popular and recent searches and
recently viewed businesses. Search results will show relevant images
from listings, similar to the home feed. Yelp will also feature
carousels for "People also search for" and "Popular Dishes Nearby." 

 APPLE VISION PRO REVIEW: MAGIC, UNTIL IT‚ÄôS NOT (45 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple Vision Pro feels magic when it works and frustrates you when it
doesn't. There are some mundane but relevant things that happen when
you use it, like how it messes up your hair and makeup. Aside from
that, using the Vision Pro is a lonely experience. There's only you
having experiences nobody else can share in. 

 NESCAF√â‚ÄôS ‚ÄúMAJOR REBRAND‚Äù IS TOO SAFE TO STAND OUT (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Nescaf√© has undergone a major rebrand with subtle design changes.
The rebrand has sparked questions about the company's ability to
compete in the modern coffee packaging landscape. While the new design
refreshes some elements, it may struggle to keep up with smaller
brands that embrace contemporary, illustrative packaging trends as it
is missing the personalized appeal that defines modern coffee
packaging.

 IN PRAISE OF BUTTONS ‚Äì PART ONE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We have recently seen an increase in buttons that consist merely of
text or icons without a clear visible button shape being present in
graphical user interfaces. Virtual buttons in a graphical user
interface should look like buttons so they commu¬≠nicate that they can
be used. 

 THE FEATURE TRAP: WHY FEATURE CENTRICITY IS HARMING YOUR PRODUCT (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Thinking in terms of features makes it easy to manage the complex
task of product delivery. However, it becomes evident that the space
between features can be just as crucial if you recognize that the best
products are more than the sum of their parts. 

 DISABLED BUTTONS UX ‚Äì USABILITY ISSUES AND HOW TO AVOID THEM (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Disabled buttons in UI can be confusing: they break the experience,
interrupt the flow, cause accessibility problems, and don‚Äôt
communicate the system's status effectively. Instead, designers should
consider hiding them all together, providing tooltips showing the
reason for disabling them, or not using disabled buttons.

 MAPPING THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY IN IOT UX DESIGN: A GUIDE (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The word "experience" takes on a whole new meaning when a product
must be installed, onboarded, and interacted with physically and
through an app or dashboard. In IoT UX design, it's essential to
ensure the product works flawlessly from beginning to end, going
beyond UI. Designing such broad user experiences requires a more
expansive approach based on customer journeys, IoT value feedback
loops, and scenario-driven user testing. 

 HOW TO SIMPLIFY FIGURES FOR ANIMATION (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Since animation requires drawing many lines, the fewer you draw, the
more efficient an animation will be. Designing a simple character is
mostly about retaining as much information as possible while reducing
it to the essentials.
