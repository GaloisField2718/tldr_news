 AUTODESK IS SUING GOOGLE OVER THE NAME OF ITS FLOW AI VIDEOMAKER (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Autodesk is suing Google over trademark infringement, claiming
Google's AI video generator, Flow, will confuse customers with
Autodesk's own "Flow" brand of AI-enabled filmmaking tools launched in
2022. Autodesk alleges that after requesting that Google stop using
the name, Google misrepresented its intentions and filed trademark
applications, even though confusion between the products had already
occurred on social media. The company is seeking a court order to
block Google from using the Flow trademark and unspecified damages.

 FACEBOOK PROFILE PICTURES CAN NOW BE ANIMATED WITH AI (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Meta has introduced AI-powered features on Facebook that animate
profile pictures, restyle photos in Stories and Memories with text
prompts or preset styles, and add animated backgrounds to text posts.
The updates aim to boost creativity and help revive “OG Facebook”
appeal, as Meta seeks to make the platform more culturally relevant
again.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE DESIGN THAT STAYS IN WORDS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many design leaders talk about quality and strategy but have lost
touch with actual design craft, making them unable to recognize or
build good work. While these leaders focus on metrics and facilitating
meetings, the real value comes from designers who maintain hands-on
skills and can make tangible decisions that improve products. The gap
is widening between those who only talk about design and those who
actually practice it, with the latter being more valuable in today's
fast-moving environment. 

 WHY USERS GET LOST IN YOUR PRODUCT (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product taxonomy directly impacts user adoption, conversion, and
growth across PLG companies. Without deliberate structure (ideally 2-3
hierarchical levels, like Product > Tool > Feature), confusion
compounds from pricing pages to analytics, leading to drops in
conversion, slower time-to-value, and misalignment across teams.
Simple, consistent classification systems enable users to learn
faster, teams to build cohesively, and growth to scale without
accumulating "clarity debt." 

 THE 80% JOB: HOW DESIGN LEADS ARE USING AI — AND IT'S NOT ABOUT
MOCKUPS (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design leadership is far less about crafting pixels and far more
about communication, mediation, justification, and stakeholder
alignment — often leaving little to no time for actual design work.
AI's biggest opportunity for design leads isn't generating mockups,
but reclaiming time through automating meetings, research synthesis,
documentation, and quick “vibe-coded” prototypes that help win
alignment, de-risk ideas, and free up space for the strategic judgment
only humans can provide.

 LINEAR DESIGN VS. MINIMALISM, BRUTALISM, AND NEUMORPHISM (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Linear design emerged from decades of UX research and represents a
practical approach to minimalism, featuring monochrome color palettes,
single sans-serif fonts, and subtle animations that prioritize
usability and accessibility. Unlike brutalism, which uses extreme
contrast for bold visual impact, or neumorphism, which creates
artificial lighting effects through shadows, linear design focuses on
clear boundaries and visual affordances that enhance user experience.
Linear design's minimalist traits serve functional rather than purely
artistic purposes, making it more effective for usability than other
design trends.

 THIS IS THE FIRST SMARTPHONE DESIGNED BY KIDS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AT&T's amiGO Jr. is a kid-focused smartphone built with Samsung that
gives parents advanced controls over screen time, apps, location
sharing, and school-hour restrictions via their own devices. While it
offers strong parental safeguards and solid specs, the phone looks
like a standard Android device, raising debate over whether a
controlled smartphone is better than no phone at all — and whether
its design truly feels kid-friendly.
