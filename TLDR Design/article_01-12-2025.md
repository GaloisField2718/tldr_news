NEWS & TRENDS

 CREATE INTERFACES FROM A PROMPT: FIGMA GETS GEMINI 3 PRO (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Google's new Gemini 3 model is now integrated into Figma Make, where
it can generate layouts, components, design systems, and even HTML/CSS
from text prompts or reference images. It speeds up prototyping with
animations and states, and while it still needs refinement for complex
work, it significantly lowers the barrier for beginners and boosts
efficiency for pros. 

 APPLE GAVE VISION PRO TWO BIG, VERY NEEDED UPGRADES RECENTLY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has significantly improved Vision Pro in two areas: lifelike
spatial Personas in visionOS 26 and a more comfortable Dual Knit Band.
The updated Personas now look realistic and enable convincing shared
spatial experiences, while the new band improves weight distribution,
making long sessions more comfortable even though the headset itself
still needs to get lighter. 

 PROJECT GRAPH IS ADOBE'S MOST IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE YEAR (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Project Graph is a node-based system that enables users to create
custom workflows by connecting tools across Adobe Creative Cloud and
third-party AI models through simplified interfaces called "capsules."
Unveiled at Adobe's MAX conference, the tool emerged from Adobe's
Incubator program to address AI's overreliance on prompts, offering
professionals greater tactile control over their creative processes.
Project Graph allows users to combine features from Photoshop,
Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and external AI partners into reusable
tools that work throughout Adobe's ecosystem.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 IS CREATIVITY REALLY DEAD? (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 D&AD's new Uncommon-led manifesto boldly asks whether creativity is
“dead or alive,” blaming apathy and over-talking while urging
creatives to “shut up and make.” However, critics argue it simply
creates more noise, rehashes a tired question, and ignores the real
structural issues—AI, unstable incomes, shrinking budgets—that
creatives urgently need leadership and clear guidance on. 

 QUANTIFYING UX SUCCESS AND PROVING VALUE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Success is best demonstrated through clear metrics: combine
qualitative stories with hard quantitative data (ideally tied to
financial impact), align your KPIs with organizational goals, and
measure across engagement, usability, and conversion rather than a
single metric. After, report results through storytelling, dashboards,
impact reports, and demos—because showing the monetary value of UX
improvements is what truly motivates stakeholders and drives
organizational change. 

 UX IS YOUR MOAT (AND YOU'RE IGNORING IT) (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Research shows new products must be nine times better to overcome
users' attachment to existing tools, yet AI companies focus on
incremental benchmark improvements while ignoring that user experience
and interface comfort create the real competitive moat. Netflix's
streaming dominance, despite lacking the best content, exemplifies how
seamless, friction-free experiences trump raw capabilities, a lesson
AI companies overlook as they compete on model performance rather than
building interfaces that make users feel at home.

 MONOPO'S REBRAND FOR NKORA PUTS THE CALM BACK INTO COFFEE CULTURE (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NKORA's rebrand by Monopo emphasizes the café's warm, lived-in
character, moving away from the minimalism common in modern coffee
culture. Centered on “slow coffee” rituals, the new identity
introduces Miles—a hand-carved linocut mascot—along with tactile
typography and local walking-route illustrations, creating a human,
soulful visual world that connects all seven locations while
preserving NKORA's independent spirit. 

 DESIGN TOKENS AREN'T ENOUGH. ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS NEED A PLACE IN
YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design Tokens reveal what design decisions are, but Architecture
Decision Records (ADRs) capture the crucial "why" behind those
choices. ADRs document principles like avoiding hierarchy terms
(primary and secondary) in favor of emphasis descriptors (strong,
standard, and subtle), providing context that keeps decisions
consistent and searchable. This living documentation helps onboard new
team members, jog future memory, and train LLMs to maintain system
integrity across projects. 

 HOW TO BECOME A SENIOR DESIGNER (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Career growth in design requires intentional, proactive effort rather
than waiting for good work to be automatically recognized. Designers
should identify organizational blind spots with significant impact
potential but without ownership. Focusing on these fundamental UX
improvements, combined with strategic visibility and stakeholder
engagement, creates pathways from smaller to more impactful projects.
