NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES DOPPL, A NEW APP THAT LETS YOU VISUALIZE HOW AN
OUTFIT MIGHT LOOK ON YOU (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's Doppl is an experimental AI app that creates digital
versions of users to try on clothing from photos or screenshots
virtually. Users upload full-body images and then select outfits to
see how they'd look, with options to generate videos and share the
results. The iOS and Android app, currently available in the U.S.,
builds on Google Shopping's virtual try-on technology, focusing on
personalized body visualization rather than displaying clothes on
diverse models. 

 FIGMA VARIABLE WIDTH STROKES (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma has introduced a variable-width stroke vector editing tool that
allows users to adjust stroke width at any point along a path in both
Figma Draw and Design. The feature enables pressure-sensitive drawing
on tablets, automatically adjusting stroke width based on stylus
pressure for more realistic freehand drawing. This enhancement makes
digital drawing in Figma more responsive and natural for tablet users.


 APPLE SPORTS APP REDESIGNED WITH NEW PERSONALIZED SECTIONS, ADDS
TENNIS SCORES JUST IN TIME FOR WIMBLEDON (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Apple Sports app has been updated with a redesigned home screen
that allows users to reorder leagues and prioritize starred teams,
along with the addition of live tennis scores just in time for
Wimbledon. The tennis experience includes detailed match stats, court
visuals, and support for Live Activities on iPhone and Apple Watch.
The app remains limited to users in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.

 AESTHETICS OVER UPGRADES (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Technology has matured to the point where new devices bring only
minor improvements, making it possible to prioritize timeless design
and material quality over always upgrading. With older devices
remaining functionally viable, it's now easier to choose products for
their aesthetic and durability. 

 LIQUID GLASS, FRAGILE UX, AND WHY I WANTED 2 WEEKS BEFORE WRITING
ABOUT IT (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's new “Liquid Glass” design in iOS 26 marks its most
dramatic visual shift since iOS 7, replacing static flat design with a
dynamic, glass-like material that bends light, reacts to touch, and
conveys depth through motion and translucency. More than just visual
flair, this approach introduces a new paradigm — computational
design — where UI elements behave like responsive, living materials,
reshaping how designers and developers think about consistency,
accessibility, and user experience. 

 PRESENTING THE CHANGE YOU'VE MADE THROUGH YOUR DECISIONS AS A
DESIGNER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product designers often struggle to demonstrate impact when their
work doesn't directly relate to revenue metrics, such as ROI or
conversion rates. This article outlines alternative impact areas,
including time savings, cost reduction, process simplification, and
improved internal metrics that designers can measure and present to
stakeholders. A technique from Leadership Ateliers involves mapping
how design decisions create ripple effects across multiple
departments, teams, and user personas simultaneously.

 IPHONE 17 PRO MAY REPOSITION THE APPLE LOGO ONCE AGAIN, SAYS LEAKER
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A new rumor from leaker Majin Bu suggests Apple may reposition the
Apple logo on the iPhone 17 Pro, moving it below the new rear camera
bar instead of keeping it centered. While the claim is unconfirmed and
somewhat questionable, similar leaks from case manufacturers have
proven accurate in the past, lending some credibility to the
speculation. 

 LIQUID GLASS, BUT IN CSS (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A developer analyzed Apple's new Liquid Glass effect by breaking it
down into layered CSS and SVG techniques, including inset shadows for
edge highlights, `backdrop-filter` for blur and color adjustment, and
custom SVG filters for light refraction, ripple distortion, and
chromatic aberration. While the effect can be convincingly replicated
with modern CSS and SVG, it's not fully supported across browsers like
Safari or Firefox, and its high GPU cost limits its use to select UI
elements rather than full interfaces. 

 DEAR LOADING SPINNER, WE NEED TO TALK (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Loading spinners have evolved from symbols of hope into sources of
user frustration, representing broken systems rather than actual
progress. While spinners endlessly rotate without providing meaningful
feedback, alternatives like progress bars and skeleton screens offer
users honest, structured information about what's happening. The
relationship between users and loading spinners has deteriorated to
the point where the spinning icon now triggers anxiety and abandonment
rather than patience.
