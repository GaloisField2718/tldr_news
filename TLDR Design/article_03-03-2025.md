 UX IS DEAD, LONG LIVE UX (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Traditional UX focusing on product interfaces is becoming less

 IN DEFENSE OF TEXT LABELS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Icons alone rarely communicate meaning effectively, often increasing
cognitive load and slowing navigation. Text labels improve clarity,
reduce ambiguity, and enhance efficiency, particularly in complex
