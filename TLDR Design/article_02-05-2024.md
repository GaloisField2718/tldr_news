 THE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL OF SYSTEM THINKING IN MODERN DESIGN (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Every product goes through five stages according to the Product Life
Cycle (PLC). As a product matures, system thinking provides the
flexibility necessary for a more sustainable existence, which avoids
unnecessary rewrites or pivots. Incorporating system thinking into a
workflow requires establishing a dedicated and centralized platform,
implementing frameworks and patterns, creating a shared UI library,
and implementing system processes and checks. 

 WHY CREATIVE LABOUR ISN'T ALWAYS SEEN AS ‚ÄúREAL WORK‚Äù ‚Äì AND WHAT
THAT MEANS FOR ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropologist and illustrator Julien Posture explains why creative
work has always been seen as opposing productive labor. The problem
has been made worse with generative AI models since they require
massive amounts of unpaid and uncredited input, whereas the labor that
drives their output needs to be noticed. Creatives rarely organize in
unions, but this can strengthen their bargaining position and create
the standards they want to operate. 

 DON'T PUT CRAP IN THE DESIGN SYSTEM (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A design system should consist of high-quality, vetted solutions, not
rushed or low-quality work known as "crap," which undermines its
reliability and the trust of its users. To handle inevitable crap,
organizations can adopt strategies like establishing a layered UI
ecosystem, allowing different paces for product and design system
development, and formalizing conversational governance to manage and
mitigate the impact thoughtfully.

 THE BEST NUMBER FONTS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 When looking at numbers within a font, there are many considerations,
such as whether the characters are capital-height or have ascender and
descender lines. Additionally, check whether the zero is similar to a
capital O. You should also remember that a minivan font can cause the
number 1 to appear lonely if tracking is not applied. This article
