 FOUR MUST-SEE FEATURES IN ZOOM‚ÄôS BIG NEW REDESIGN (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Zoom's most significant redesign comes with a new platform called
Zoom Workplace, which uses AI to compete with Slack and Teams. The new
features address anxieties around screen sharing, stuffiness in online
meetings, and getting work done. Zoom is also improving UI by updating
its gradient backdrops, adding color to everyone's windows, and
redesigning its bottom bar of icons to express more personality,
softness, and value of care.

(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A recent patent application by Apple describes techniques for
enabling drawing in a computer-generated reality environment. It
illustrates how the company plans to track users' hands and allow them
to draw without additional devices on Vision Pro. The technology lets
users pinch their fingers like a paintbrush to make an object appear
over their hand. When the user switches tools, Apple Vision Pro
changes the virtual object in the user's hand.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOLD ON, BUT SHOULD DESIGN MANAGERS DESIGN‚Ä¶? (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design management encompasses various roles, from those heavily
involved in hands-on design to leaders focusing exclusively on
strategy and guiding their teams. The kind of leader one becomes is
primarily dictated by business context, organizational structure, and
team dynamics. The actual test of leadership is where team members
turn to their problems, identifying the de facto leader beyond titles.


 THE DEATH OF CRAFT (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The rise of AI in the creative industry is a return to the past, as
AI can only combine existing ideas and not create genuinely new ones.
Becoming overly proficient in a single tool can be limiting, as tools
can become irrelevant over time. The future may see a shift towards a
more adaptable, generalized skillset due to the changing landscape of
the creative industry. 

 WHY UX DESIGNERS SHOULD CREATE OBJECT MAPS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An aligned mental model between what users perceive and how products
perform makes completing tasks easy. When mental models are not
aligned, it can make using the product so difficult that users give up
using it. You can facilitate and enhance the design of workflows,
mock-ups, and prototypes by creating a map of the objects users
create, edit, and use within a product.

READ) [14]

 HOW TO DESIGN CLIMATE-FORWARD AI COMPANIES (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Despite the immense benefits AI promises, it substantially impacts
the environment. The gravity of this footprint makes it crucial that
every AI company is a climate company, and thoughtful design is
critical to achieving that goal. We should design for AI with
decarbonization in mind, preferring more sustainable hardware and
infrastructure, aiming for simpler yet powerful user interfaces, and
be able to define where AI makes an actual difference.
