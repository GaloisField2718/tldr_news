 DESIGN ETHOS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers have to be visionaries, but nothing can be promised‚Äîonly
proposed. We must identify challenges, ask honest questions, and
problem-solve with a systematic yet open and passionate mind to serve
us in the quest to design well for the future. As we learn from each
project, each other, and evolving technologies, we can ultimately
design with more efficiency, less ambiguity, better ethics, and a
continual sense of artful wonder.

 MY PROCESS WHEN STARTING A NEW JOB (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Starting new projects can be stressful but there are things designers
should focus on to make beginnings easier. Managing information
overload by keeping a rolling document of notes and finding and
achieving small wins in the very first few weeks are great ways to get
started. However, these may lead to a lot of stress so self-care
should be prioritized and regular communication with key people on the
projects should be established. 

 HOW TO FIX A BAD USER INTERFACE (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The screens you design for your product can have as many as five

important to consider the transition between them. Your users might be
confused or surprised as new states appear and disappear without
transitional elements.
