READ) [5]

 FTC INVESTIGATING ADOBE OVER MAKING IT TOO HARD TO CANCEL
SUBSCRIPTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 After widespread complaints, the FTC is investigating Adobe for
making it too difficult for consumers to cancel app subscriptions.
Regulations about 'click to cancel' were proposed recently, defining a
simple cancellation mechanism, limits to additional offers for
customers, and annual reminders to consumers participating in negative
option programs. Adobe charges a proportionate cancellation fee if you
cancel more than two weeks into your subscription and does not remind
users about their subscriptions annually - it simply auto-renews.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google‚Äôs Imagen 2 image generator can render text in multiple
languages while generating high-quality, photorealistic,

the borders of an image.

instead of margins. 

 NORMAN DOORS: HOW DO WE STILL GET THIS WRONG? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The ‚ÄúNorman door‚Äù concept is a well-known and widely recognized
principle among designers. Named after design guru Don Norman, it
describes any door that proves confusing or difficult to use,

latest and probably the best example of doors that fail in usability.

 Unlike consumer applications, enterprise applications primarily focus
on efficiency, fault tolerance, and repetitive use. In other words,

handling, and displaying data.

all websites. Recent testing shows no correlation between the number
of user clicks and the success in finding the content the users
sought.
