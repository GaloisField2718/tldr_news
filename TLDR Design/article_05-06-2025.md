 ADOBE FINALLY RELEASES PHOTOSHOP FOR ANDROID, AND IT'S FREE (FOR NOW)
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe has released Photoshop for Android in beta. The iPhone version
was launched in February. The free beta includes core desktop features
like masks, layers, clone stamps, and generative AI tools for object
removal and content insertion. Unlike previous mobile attempts like
Photoshop Express, this version offers comprehensive functionality,
though it lacks filters and pixel-based cropping. Adobe hasn't
revealed pricing details, but expect a subscription model similar to
Lightroom mobile once the beta period ends. 

 EPIC IS MAKING IT EASIER TO CREATE METAHUMANS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Epic Games' MetaHuman Creator has been integrated directly into
Unreal Engine 5.6, eliminating the need for separate tools. The
updated system extends face-authoring capabilities to full body
creation with fine-tuned parameters for comprehensive character
development. Developers can now sell their MetaHumans on Epic's Fab
marketplace and use real-time animation with consumer webcams. New
licensing options allow MetaHuman to be used in competing engines like
Unity and Godot, plus creative software, including Maya and Blender. 

 NBA FANS THINK ORLANDO MAGIC'S NEW LOGO HAS LOST ITS SPARKLE (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Orlando Magic have revealed a new visual identity—including
jerseys, court design, and a modernized logo—for the first time in
14 years. The rebrand has divided fans who feel it plays things too
safe. While the updated look aims for clean, contemporary appeal, many
critics argue it lacks the boldness and uniqueness needed to resonate
with a passionate fanbase.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE TEMPLATE TRAP: HOW TEMPLATE CULTURE IS DUMBING DOWN UX (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The UX field increasingly relies on templates and frameworks as
universal solutions rather than adaptable starting points, undermining
critical thinking. Social media amplifies this "template trap" by
spreading decontextualized tools that newer practitioners adopt
without proper evaluation or modification. This overreliance risks
force-fitting solutions, missing contextual nuances, and collectively
lowering professional standards in UX work. The solution involves
starting with clear goals, evaluating template alignment, seeking
real-world applications, and making deliberate modifications to
reclaim intellectual rigor. 

 THE NEW MANDATE: DESIGN LEADERSHIP IN AN AI-NATIVE WORLD (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Design leaders can no longer wait for permission or clarity in an
AI-native world where intelligence has moved into the interface.
AI-native products require systems-level thinking, with designers
shaping system behaviors, ethical boundaries, and interaction
architecture rather than just polishing surfaces. The shift demands
moving from execution to direction, refinement to authorship, as
design becomes a strategic co-author of products rather than a support
function. Design leaders must proactively shape conversations,
roadmaps, and how intelligence behaves, leading from the future rather
than waiting for invitations to participate.

 WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE TO OTHER CREATIVES? IT'S PROBABLY NOT

 Success in the creative industries is shifting away from traditional
benchmarks, such as prestigious roles and high salaries, toward more
personal and meaningful goals, including freedom, balance, impact, and

 As AI transforms tools, workflows, and user expectations, UX design
is shifting from interface-centric practices to dynamic, system-level
thinking, emphasizing personalization, ethical responsibility, and
