MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new Harris-Walz campaign logo underwent subtle changes, including
centering the crossbar in the "H" and reshaping the "R" legs, with an

redesign addresses early criticism over kerning and height
differences, aligning with historic, straightforward presidential
campaign designs.
