 NEW IPHONE 17 PRO RENDERS HIGHLIGHT ALUMINUM DESIGN, REPOSITIONED
APPLE LOGO (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new leaked image reveals a clearer look at the iPhone 17 Pro's
redesigned Apple logo, which will be centered on the glass portion of
the device rather than the phone's full body. The iPhone 17 Pro is
also expected to feature a two-tone design with an aluminum frame and
camera bump, while retaining a glass panel for MagSafe and wireless
functions, marking a subtle but notable design shift. 

 H&M DEPLOYS AI ‘TWINS' TO MODEL CLOTHES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 H&M launched AI-generated fashion models created as virtual "twins"
of real human models, allowing them to maintain creative control over
their digital counterparts. The clothing retailer uses these AI models
to showcase products across multiple outfits, reducing the need for
human models in photo shoots. H&M emphasized that the technology
supports, rather than replaces, their human-centered creative
approach, though fewer human models will be needed to produce the same
volume of fashion imagery.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 USER BEHAVIOURS, PRODUCT DESIGN ARCHITECTURE, AND THE IMPACT OF AI
(17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product Design Architecture is shaped by eight core user behaviors
that determine how information is accessed, with match extraction
being one of the most widespread behaviors requiring filtering,
comparison, and listing mechanisms. Products like Airbnb and Shazam
demonstrate how understanding these behaviors helps teams design
coherent systems and spot opportunities for improvement. AI will
likely transform search-heavy products the most significantly, while
having a minimal impact on exploration-based products, as it excels at
handling specific criteria but offers less value for vague, low-effort
interactions. 

 MORE ASSORTED NOTES ON LIQUID GLASS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's new "Liquid Glass" design language has sparked confusion and
criticism, with many finding it visually inconsistent, functionally
unclear, and overly prescriptive, prioritizing aesthetic gimmicks like
translucency and rounded elements over usability and clarity. Apple's
increasingly homogenized and restrictive design system sacrifices
individuality, legibility, and developer freedom in favor of a bland,
corporate uniformity that diminishes both app identity and user
experience. 

 A LOT OF THIS IS ABOUT RITUALS – AN HOUR WITH NOTION DESIGN CHIEF
RANDY HUNT (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Randy Hunt, head of design at Notion, emphasizes the importance of
culture, communication, and curiosity in both design leadership and
team dynamics, highlighting how rituals like biweekly "Design
Lightning" sessions foster collaboration among highly capable,
entrepreneurial designers. He sees AI not as a threat but a design
opportunity, stressing thoughtful, user-centered integration over
trend-chasing, and advocates for preparing future designers with
flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit, and a deep understanding of
craft, business, and marketing.

 USING LLMS AS A PRODUCT DESIGNER: A RETROSPECTIVE (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 A product designer's LLM-assisted workflow has evolved since December
2024, with the role shifting toward code reviews and tool
orchestration rather than traditional design work. The current toolkit
includes Subframe, UX Pilot, Figma with Dev Mode MCP server, Cursor
for development, and Claude/Gemini for architecture and debugging. The
key breakthrough was providing rich context to tools like Cursor,
transforming prototyping from weeks-long design cycles into hours-long
code iterations that put users directly into real experiences.

 America250 is a nonpartisan initiative organizing the 250th
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, aiming to create the
most inclusive commemoration in U.S. history. Its visual identity
features a flowing red, white, and blue ribbon forming the number 250,
symbolizing unity and celebration, and is supported by the
“America's Invitation” campaign, inviting citizens to share
personal expressions of what America means to them.

identity—including a dynamic owl mascot, warmer color palette, and
user-generated imagery—the brand leans into its human roots,
rejecting generic design trends in favor of a more personal,
relatable, and experience-driven approach.
