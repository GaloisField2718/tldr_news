 OPENAI ADDS REUSABLE ‘CHARACTERS' AND VIDEO STITCHING TO SORA (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has expanded Sora 2's capabilities by introducing "character
cameos," which allow users to turn pets, illustrations, toys, and
other subjects into reusable AI video avatars with customizable
sharing permissions. The update also adds video stitching, which
combines multiple clips into longer, multi-scene videos, as well as
leaderboards showcasing popular content and characters. OpenAI
temporarily opened sign-ups for the Sora app in the US, Canada, Japan,
and Korea without requiring invitation codes. 

 PEPSICO REBRANDS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 25 YEARS, AND I'M UNDERWHELMED
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 PepsiCo has unveiled a new logo, shifting from its 25-year-old design
to lowercase letters centered on a “P” surrounded by shapes
representing food, drinks, sustainability, and consumer focus, with a
tagline of “Food. Drinks. Smiles.” However, critics find it overly
complicated, underwhelming, and unlikely to raise awareness of its
extensive portfolio beyond Pepsi itself. 

 PERPLEXITY STRIKES MULTI-YEAR LICENSING DEAL WITH GETTY IMAGES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI search startup Perplexity has signed a multi-year licensing
agreement with Getty Images, enabling it to display Getty's stock
photos across its AI-powered search tools, accompanied by proper
attribution and links to sources. The deal marks a shift for
Perplexity, which faced plagiarism accusations this year for scraping
content and images from news organizations. While Getty was previously
part of Perplexity's Publishers' Program for revenue sharing, this new
deal legitimizes the startup's past use of Getty photos.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GOOD FROM AFAR, BUT FAR FROM GOOD: AI PROTOTYPING IN REAL DESIGN
CONTEXTS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An evaluation of AI prototyping tools, using a real redesign project,
found that they can follow instructions to achieve general goals but
lack the sophistication to produce thoughtful, high-quality designs
without extensive human guidance. More specific prompts with detailed
requirements yielded better results, though AI outputs still missed
subtle nuances in visual hierarchy, spacing, and grouping that
distinguish polished designs from merely adequate ones. The tools are
most effective for early ideation and concept exploration, rather than
final production, and paradoxically require a strong design knowledge
to use effectively. 

 UX IS MORE THAN SCREENS: THE ART OF DESIGNING EMOTIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Steve Jobs transformed Apple by prioritizing emotional design over
pure functionality, establishing "form follows emotion" as a guiding
principle that science later validated through research showing
aesthetics affect perceived usability. Emotional design operates on
three levels—visceral, behavioral, and reflective—while AI now
amplifies human empathy by creating hyper-personalized experiences
that adapt to users' emotional states in real-time. The future of UX
depends on synergizing artificial and emotional intelligence to design
systems that understand not just user actions, but their feelings,
making authentic human connection the ultimate measure of success. 

 DEVELOPERS SHOULDN'T LEARN DESIGN. DESIGNERS SHOULDN'T CODE (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The debate over whether designers should code or developers should
design misses the real issue: collaboration fails not from lack of
shared skills, but from poorly structured roles built around handoffs
instead of understanding. True progress comes from clarity—distinct
yet connected roles like UX vs. UI and logic-focused vs. view-focused
developers—working in a network, not a pipeline. Teams don't need
hybrids - they need specialists who understand adjacent disciplines,
especially the often-overlooked UI Developer who bridges design and
implementation.

 INTUITIVE INTERFACES: WHAT ACTUALLY MAKES THEM CLEAR (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Intuitive interfaces aren't created through templates or familiar
patterns alone, but through systematic work that accounts for business
goals, the product, and how users think. Poor visual quality, unmet
expectations, high cognitive load, and ignoring user scenarios create
"roadblocks" that confuse people and make them feel stupid, ultimately
driving them away. The key is adapting interfaces to users rather than
forcing users to adapt, focusing on clarity that builds confidence and
enables people to accomplish their goals without struggling through
confusing design. 

 YOU'RE DOING VIBE CODING WRONG: HERE'S HOW TO DO IT RIGHT (11 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Vibe coding can accelerate development when used strategically for
low-risk tasks, such as personal scripts, static sites, and
prototypes. However, it becomes dangerous when applied to
security-critical systems, including authentication, payment
processing, or healthcare applications. Common pitfalls include
AI-generated security vulnerabilities, accumulating technical debt
through prompt-driven architecture sprawl, and debugging code that
developers don't understand. To code responsibly, developers need
foundational coding knowledge, must break projects into testable
units, validate all AI outputs, maintain version control, and choose
popular and well-documented frameworks and libraries. 

 PENTAGRAM USES CLEVER DESIGN TO BRING UNSEEN WOMEN INTO FOCUS (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 UNSEEN, a campaign by Marina Willer and Pentagram, brings global
attention to the plight of North Korean women through striking
visuals—a translucent red dot covering each woman's face to
symbolize both erasure and resilience. Supported by Amnesty
International and others, the campaign turns absence into presence
using thoughtful design and ethical storytelling to confront hidden
suffering while preserving dignity, reminding creatives that powerful
work carries responsibility, meaning, and the courage to challenge
audiences.
