 DON‚ÄôT DESIGN FOR AI (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When you have a large language model, everything looks like an
opportunity for a chat-based assistant. Only some problems need to be

exploration of alternative solutions, benchmarking, and evaluation,
leading to the most suitable solution. 

 ACCESSIBILITY HAS FAILED: TRY GENERATIVE UI = INDIVIDUALIZED UX (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The accessibility movement hasn't accomplished much despite three
decades of effort. Users with disabilities still face many challenges
due to user experiences that do not take their characteristics into
account. Handcrafting optimized user experiences for each category of
disabled users has failed as it is too costly and fragmented. However,
a generative user interface could adapt to any user, regardless of
context.

 HOW CREATIVITY POWERS PROFITS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies with innovation-focused cultures are three times more
profitable. Despite its benefits, creativity is difficult to achieve
and maintain. People matter, but it's also about creating an
environment that encourages breakthrough thinking and spreading

 DUNE: PART TWO ‚Äì HANS ZIMMER DESIGNS THE SOUND OF SAND (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Hans Zimmer, the genius behind The Dark Knight and Gladiator
soundtracks, played a crucial role in setting the epic scenes in Dune:
Part Two. The movie's score evokes an industrial, mechanical, and
brutal audio landscape, a departure from the German composer's usual
orchestral music. Zimmer's sonic world was designed through a
collaboration across departments before the cameras started rolling
involving conversations about the book that inspired the movie. 

 USABLE INTERNET (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Despite its ability and usefulness as a tool, recent trends and
standards have rendered the Internet into an unpredictable and
frustrating user experience. The petition for a usable internet calls
for the end of pop-ups, a reduction in notifications, a stop to the
signaling of untrue importance, a reduction in UI complexity, and a
reduction of visual stimulation.
