MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube is trialing a color filter feature on its mobile app that
allows users to customize their video feeds by selecting red, blue, or
green hues, enhancing visual cohesion and aesthetics. The feature,
which is in an experimental phase and not widely available, presents
color-coordinated video suggestions as a new feed option. 

 PEPSI TROLLS COCA-COLA AGAIN IN PROVOCATIVE NEW CAMPAIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Pepsi has launched a provocative 'Tastes OK' campaign in Australia,
directly challenging Coca-Cola by highlighting the word 'OK' subtly
embedded in the Coca-Cola logo and suggesting that consumers should
opt for Pepsi Max instead. The campaign is bold and humorous but
carries the risk of giving too much visibility to Coca-Cola. 

 IKEA‚ÄôS AI ASSISTANT GIVES DESIGN INSPIRATION ‚Äî AT LEAST IT TRIES
TO (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Ikea AI assistant, designed to streamline the shopping experience
by providing product details and visualizations, falls short of
expectations. Users find it redirecting to the Ikea website rather
than offering concrete design solutions or accurate stock information.
The current iteration of the Ikea GPT AI assistant lacks practical
utility, leading users to prefer traditional methods like browsing the
website or consulting catalogs.

 AN INSIDER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO A SEAMLESS FIGMA MIGRATION (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Migration to Figma is a multi-stage transformative journey, not just
a tool switch. Essential steps include meticulous planning, creating a
core advocacy team, and securing cross-functional support. Practical
steps involve setting up foundational elements, crafting communication
plans, and mapping migration timelines. 

 THE ERA OF SPATIAL TYPOGRAPHY IS HERE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Type designers can now consider depth, rotation, and positioning as
new properties when designing augmented or virtual reality typography.
These new dimensions will require unique aspects to be considered,
such as making typography adaptable to different backgrounds or able
to be pinned to objects. Additionally, text must be adjusted for
factors such as changing distance to avoid blurriness. Sharp sans
serifs are likely the best choice for Apple's Vision Pro since they
suggest the idea of digital innovation. 

 UI ELEMENTS ARE NOT SO ELEMENTARY (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The default styles of web elements can significantly affect design as
they dictate the basic appearance and behavior of form elements, such
as checkboxes, radio buttons, and toggles. Developers often need to
use specific techniques to customize these elements' style and
behavior, such as hiding certain elements or using JavaScript, which
can lead to potential issues in handoff processes.
