 KIT KAT GOT A BULKY NEW LOGO THAT LOOKS A LOT MORE LIKE AN ACTUAL KIT
KAT (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Kit Kat's new U.S. logo, designed by Sterling Brands, features
bulkier, straighter letters with a dark drop shadow that exude an
energetic and clean aesthetic, much like a loud snap. The rebrand aims
to enhance the brand's iconic 'break' while maintaining the familiar
shape and size of the packaging, offering a cleaner and somewhat retro
look. This redesign comes as Hershey seeks to boost candy sales amidst
consumer cutbacks on discretionary spending.

 Mozilla's latest logo features a design that seems to resemble a

"Moz://a" logo was shared in a blog post, and a new symbol with an
eye-like dot was found in some Github code commits, hinting at a
possible flag representation. Initially designed by Shepard Fairey and
retired in 2012, the original red dinosaur logo seems to have inspired
this new homage.
