 GOOGLE ADDS IMAGE-TO-VIDEO GENERATION CAPABILITY TO VEO 3 (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Google expanded its Veo 3 AI video generator by adding image-to-video
functionality to the Gemini app, allowing users to upload photos and
generate videos with optional audio descriptions. The feature, which
has been available in the Flow tool since May, is now accessible in
over 150 countries. There is a three-video daily limit for Ultra and
Pro subscribers. Since launching weeks ago, users have created over 40
million videos across both platforms, with all content bearing visible
"Veo" watermarks and invisible SynthID digital markers. 

 LEAKER TEASES DYNAMIC ISLAND'S ‘SIGNIFICANT EVOLUTION' AHEAD (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple may be planning a “significant evolution” of the iPhone's
Dynamic Island, aiming for deeper integration and increased
functionality over time. Although all four iPhone 17 models are
expected to retain the current version of the feature, rumors remain
divided over whether short-term changes to their design or software
are in store. The leaker has not disclosed specific details, but their
comments suggest that Apple could be preparing for a more advanced,
possibly cut-out-free interface in the years ahead. 

 THESE PIXAR AND APPLE ALUMS WANT TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU CREATE
GENERATIVE AI VIDEO (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Intangible, a new AI video tool created by Pixar, Apple, Google, and
Unity alumni, aims to address the control issues of generative AI
video through a 3D interface. The platform enables users to create
custom 3D scenes using drag-and-drop objects, cameras, and spatial
controls, and then utilizes AI to render realistic videos from these
structured environments. While the current version shows promise in
addressing the gap between human imagination and AI video creation, it
remains imperfect with rendering mistakes and relies on existing AI
engines like Kling for final video generation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNERS: WE'LL ALL BE DESIGN ENGINEERS IN A YEAR (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 AI is reshaping how teams work by lowering the barriers to creation,
enabling anyone, from PMs to designers, to turn rough ideas into
working prototypes without waiting for specialized help. While AI
accelerates the early stages of projects, design expertise still
matters deeply for refining, guiding, and ensuring quality, so the
future belongs to those who combine craft with broader technical
fluency. 

 I'VE BEEN A DESIGNER FOR 20 YEARS – HERE'S THE KIND OF AI WE
ACTUALLY WANT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most current AI design tools reside outside the creative flow,
forcing designers to interrupt their work and wade through impressive
yet unbuildable or unsourced outputs. In contrast, “Practical AI”
must be embedded directly in the messy, iterative act of creation,
like an exoskeleton that automates real tasks (moodboards, specs,
admin, and sourcing) and keeps designers in their zone so they can
explore more ideas faster. 

 THE BEST WAY TO DESIGN FOR INDECISIVE LEADERS IS TO SERVE THEM GELATO
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers can effectively work with indecisive leaders by becoming
facilitators who make decision-making easier, much like gelato
salespeople help customers choose among many flavors. Use
problem-framing questions rather than direct statements, and present
options analysis with clear recommendations while still allowing
leaders to maintain final choice authority. This method reduces
endless revisions and frustration while avoiding the need to
antagonize leadership or completely take over decision-making
responsibilities.

 BENTLEY DOUBLES DOWN ON DESIGN WITH NEW LOGO, CONCEPT CAR, AND DESIGN
STUDIO (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Bentley has transformed its historic 1939 Crewe HQ into a
state-of-the-art design lab, highlighting a shift toward modernising
the brand with a focus on design, innovation, and electric mobility,
exemplified by the launch of the EXP 15 concept car and a new,
simplified logo. The studio brings together CMF, UX/UI, and Mulliner
teams under one roof to foster collaboration and create cars that
blend cutting-edge technology with heritage-inspired design, aiming to
meet the complex demands of luxury buyers—especially in the growing
Chinese market—while retaining Bentley's storied identity. 

 IS YOUR TEAM READY FOR AI-ENHANCED DESIGN? (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI design tools are transforming from futuristic concepts into
essential workflow accelerators, particularly excelling at rapid
prototyping and layout generation. Figma's native AI capabilities,
such as Make, have addressed key integration challenges that plagued
earlier standalone tools, making AI adoption more practical for
structured design environments. Teams should start with low-risk
pilots to build AI fluency now, as success depends more on operational
integration than tool sophistication. 

 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT UI IN AI PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI products struggle with context management, as users need to
understand what information influences responses. However, current
solutions, such as context chips, break down when dealing with
complex, multi-agent systems. The evolution from simple context
display to agent-based systems creates a nested amount of context that
overwhelms traditional UI approaches. As users become more confident
with AI tools, context management interfaces may become less
prominent, as people typically only examine the underlying process
when the results seem questionable.
