 THE HARDWARE INTERACTION DESIGNER: AN OVERLOOKED ROLE (10 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Hardware interaction designers (HIDs) are crucial throughout the
technology industry. They contribute to all stages of product
development by refining form, materials, gestures, and animations.
They pioneer new technologies like the "virtual wearable" concept,
utilizing LIDARs and projection systems while ensuring user-centered
elements like haptics and sensor requirements enhance the physical
product's user experience. 

 MISE EN MODE (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The mise en mode approach allows creativity and expression while
maintaining a structured system for user experience design. Its
premise is to think of elements like rounded corners, purple
gradients, and typography as modes on top of an underlying familiar
structure. A system like this provides user expectation guardrails,
while tokens provide a style-by-name interface to convey a form of
expression.

to make digital accessibility a fundamental right and a prerequisite
for technology to better humanity. Only when AI, the web, and
technology are available to benefit all humankind will they become
truly powerful.
