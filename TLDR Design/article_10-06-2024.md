MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Netflix's first major redesign in a decade replaces the left-hand
menu with a horizontal menu bar. Users can now hover over individual
tiles for a beat to trigger a clip from a show or movie along with a
text description and more information about it. The "New and Popular"
and "My List" tabs are gone, the "Discover" feature has been made more
prominent, and navigation has been simplified to adapt to a new
streaming landscape that includes live sports and games. Netflix is
testing the latest app version with a few subscribers before making it
available.

 Adobe's new terms and conditions for Creative Cloud apps, which grant
them a license to use, modify, and create derivative works based on
user content, have sparked controversy over content ownership. Despite
Adobe's clarification that it does not train AI models on customer
content or assume ownership, the vague wording has led to a lack of
trust among creatives, who are now considering alternatives like
Affinity Photo and GIMP.

MINUTE READ) [8]

without addressing fundamental issues undermines ongoing efforts and
the needs of vulnerable users.
