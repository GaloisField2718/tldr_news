 FIGMA TAPS GOOGLE'S GEMINI FOR FASTER, ENTERPRISE-READY AI INSIDE ITS
DESIGN PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma is integrating Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.0, and
Imagen 4 models to accelerate image generation and editing within its
design platform, with early tests showing roughly 50% faster output on
its "Make Image" feature. The integration maintains enterprise
governance controls, allowing administrators to manage AI feature
access and opt out of content training, while Imagen 4 provides
watermarking and verification capabilities for workflow provenance.
This expansion builds on Figma's existing Google Cloud relationship
and reflects the company's shift toward faster, governed AI assistance
following previous missteps with its "Make Designs" feature.

MINUTE READ) [5]

key decision-makers within buying committees, orchestrate
multi-channel campaigns, and analyze customer data to accelerate sales
cycles. The new agents, including Audience Agent, Journey Agent, and
Data Insights Agent, leverage Adobe Experience Platform's customer
data to address B2B's unique complexity, where multiple stakeholders
influence purchasing decisions. Adobe plans to expand its B2B agent
suite with an Account Qualification Agent and Brand Concierge to
automate prospecting and customer engagement further. 

 IPHONE ULTRA: WHY APPLE MIGHT GO ‘ULTRA' NEXT YEAR WITH NEW MODEL
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's rumored foldable iPhone, expected next year, could debut as
the iPhone Ultra. The name would signal a tier above the current Pro
Max, align with Apple's “Ultra” hierarchy seen in its M-series
chips and Watch Ultra, and help justify a premium $2,000+ price. It
would also differentiate Apple's device from competitors' “Fold”
models, reinforcing the company's tendency to define new categories
rather than follow existing ones.

 'HAVE I MISSED THE BOAT AT 40?' TIPS ON DEALING WITH AGEISM IN
CREATIVE JOBS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 40-year-old reader concerned about retraining in design due to
ageism finds reassurance from industry professionals, who stress that
attitude, experience, and enthusiasm outweigh age. While several
creatives acknowledge that age bias exists, many others share success
stories of career changes in their 40s and 50s, noting that maturity
often provides advantages in craft and confidence. The consensus is
that ageism is real but not insurmountable. Finding supportive
environments, maintaining resilience, and engaging in continuous
learning can help older creatives thrive in an industry that may favor
youth but ultimately rewards talent. 

 DESIGNING THE INVISIBLE BETWEEN HUMANS AND TECHNOLOGY: MY JOURNEY
BLENDING DESIGN AND BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The evolution of design work has shifted from crafting visible
interfaces to designing invisible systems that build trust and
understanding between humans and AI. Successful AI products require
three layers—visible UI, interaction design, and psychological
foundations of trust—with the deepest layer being most critical yet
hardest to design. This shift requires a focus on cognitive
psychology, human communication patterns, and relationship-building,
rather than traditional wireframes and user flows.

 I TRIED ENVATO'S GRAPHICSGEN—AND I WAS SURPRISED (15 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The author tested Envato's GraphicsGen after finding other AI image
tools like Midjourney and Google's ImageFX either too unpredictable or
too generic for professional work. GraphicsGen uses preset style
options that guide users toward consistent, professional results
without requiring prompt engineering expertise, making it practical
for everyday content creation. While the preset system limits creative
freedom compared to more flexible tools, it excels at quickly
producing usable graphics for social media, blogs, and marketing
materials.

New York City FC's subway-inspired typeface to Dallas Trinity FC's
monument-based designs, FC Basel's evolving seasonal fonts, and
Tottenham Hotspur's remastered type, bespoke lettering now serves as a
cultural and emotional bridge between clubs and fans—flexible,
ever-present, and deeply tied to place and pride.

MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Illustration is becoming a powerful tool in branding and advertising,
offering brands the ability to create imaginative, authentic worlds
that photography can't match. From Nissan's cinematic animation and
Costa Coffee's festival art to HOFF's fashion collaboration, Tesco's
illustrated packaging, TfL's community campaign, and Opihr Gin's
papercraft storytelling, 2025's standout projects show how
illustration fosters creativity, authenticity, and emotional
connection—turning campaigns into experiences rather than mere
advertisements.
