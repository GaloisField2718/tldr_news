EYE-CATCHING SHORTS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe launched a dedicated YouTube Shorts creation space in its
Premiere mobile app for iOS, announced in October and now rolling out
in December. The feature provides exclusive templates, transitions,
effects, and AI-powered tools designed to help both novice and
experienced creators produce polished Shorts directly within the app.
Users can access studio-quality editing capabilities and publish
finished videos straight to YouTube Shorts, though Android
availability remains pending. 

 GOOGLE TAPS REPLIT TO RIVAL ANTHROPIC AND CURSOR IN VIBE CODING WAR
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Cloud partnered with AI coding startup Replit in a multi-year
deal that makes Google its primary cloud provider and integrates
Gemini models into Replit's platform for enterprise customers. The
collaboration aims to democratize "vibe coding" by enabling
non-technical employees to build applications using natural language
instructions, expanding beyond traditional developer roles. Replit,
valued at $3 billion after a September funding round, experienced
explosive growth with annualized revenue surging from $2.8 million to
$150 million in under a year. 

 IPHONE FOLD WILL BE ‘MORE WIDE THAN TALL' WHEN UNFOLDED, PER REPORT
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reports say Apple's upcoming iPhone Fold will feature a uniquely wide
inner display, more like the aspect ratio of Apple's largest iPads in
landscape, rather than the tall shape used by Samsung and Google
foldables. It's expected to have a ~5.3-inch outer screen, a ~7.7-inch
inner display, and a distinct design that sets it apart from existing
foldable phones.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY MANY EMPLOYERS WANT DESIGNERS TO THINK LIKE PMS, NOT DEVS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Employers increasingly value designers who think strategically about
business problems rather than focusing on coding skills, as AI tools
can handle 80%-90% of both design and development work but struggle
with the critical "last mile" of strategic decision-making. Designers
should leverage their core strength of asking insightful questions by
engaging with customer support teams to understand user pain points
and translate them into cost-saving business recommendations. This
strategic approach makes designers more valuable and irreplaceable in
an AI-driven future where technical skills are becoming commoditized. 

 IS UI DEAD? HOW AI CHANGES INTERFACE DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Naval Ravikant's claim that "UI is pre-AI" sparked debate about
whether user interfaces become less relevant as AI handles workflows
through intention rather than navigation. The reality splits into two
paths: AI will diminish the importance of UI in optimization-driven
categories like social platforms and e-commerce, where algorithms and
conversions matter more than interface design. However, UI remains
critical for tools like Linear and Basecamp, where high-craft,
opinionated design serves as the primary differentiator and brand
identity. 

 CHATGPT TALKS TOO MUCH AND IT'S RUINING LEARNING (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT's habit of giving long, comprehensive answers can overload
students and make it too easy to skip the most important parts of
learning, such as thinking through a problem, choosing relevant
information, and structuring ideas. Applying UX and cognitive science
principles, a more effective approach would guide learners step by
step with intentional friction and interactive choices, supporting
deeper understanding, critical thinking, and more consistent learning
outcomes.

 ICONS IN MENUS EVERYWHERE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The proliferation of icons in menu items across applications like
Google Sheets and the new macOS Tahoe creates unnecessary visual noise
and cognitive load without a clear rationale for which items receive
icons. Apple's approach contradicts its own historical Human Interface
Guidelines from 1992 to 2020, which warned against arbitrary symbols
in menus, causing confusion and visual clutter. While some icons prove
useful—like Finder's window arrangement symbols that instantly
communicate layout—the default practice of adding icons everywhere
lacks the thoughtful consideration needed for each use case. 

 IT SHOULDN'T BE RADICAL: HOW ONE CREATIVE DIRECTOR TOOK A SABBATICAL
(11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Joyce N. Ho, an Emmy-winning creative director, took a multi-month
sabbatical after years of nonstop work to reconnect with the joy of
making, feeling she had drifted from hands-on creativity. During the
break, she rebranded herself, embraced her Chinese heritage, explored
generative and physical art, and rediscovered the importance of
personal work, returning with renewed clarity, creative energy, and a
new identity as an abstract artist.
