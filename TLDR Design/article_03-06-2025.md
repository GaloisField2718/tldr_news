OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MOST DESIGNERS SAY AI IMPROVES THEIR PROCESS, BUT ETHICAL CONCERNS
REMAIN (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most designers report that AI has improved their creative process,
especially during early-stage ideation, helping them overcome creative
blocks and accelerate exploration—though the final push toward
excellence still relies on human judgment. Despite this, designers are
largely left to teach themselves AI skills, leading to a disconnect
between individual innovation and organizational support. Ethical
concerns around authorship and consent continue to grow alongside
calls for structured training and responsible integration. 

 EXPERIENCE SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems are evolving beyond traditional components into
intelligent "experience systems" that adapt based on user intent,
context, and behavior. These advanced systems build upon foundations
like design tokens and components, adding agentic flows that respond
to user psychology and multimodal interfaces spanning touch, voice,
gesture, and ambient interactions. A central Logic & Governance layer
would ensure all adaptive responses follow established design
principles and decision rules at scale. This enables systems to
understand intent, adapt response modalities in real time, and
proactively assist users while maintaining brand consistency across
all touchpoints. 

 HOW TO WRITE BETTER PROMPTS FOR AI DESIGN AND CODE GENERATORS (4
MINUTE READ) [9]

significantly improves AI-generated design and code outputs by
providing clear direction beyond vague requests. The format includes
Context, Description, Platform, and Visual Style, with the final
component, UI Components, detailing specific elements from top to
bottom with placeholder content and functional behaviors. This ensures
the AI-generated interfaces are practical and ready to implement,
rather than generic or abstract designs.

 THE POST-TEST DEBRIEF: A NEW SUPERPOWER FOR GROWTH DESIGNERS (9
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Adobe's growth design team created the "Posttest Debrief," a
30-minute session held after each A/B test, which turned scattered
data into clear customer insights and strategy. It addressed the issue
of buried test results, which made it challenging to connect findings
or build on past learnings. By bringing together designers, product
managers, and analysts on a shared whiteboard, teams moved beyond
win-or-lose metrics to uncover deeper behavioral patterns. This method
accelerated planning, refined hypotheses, and established a growing
body of insights to prevent repetitive testing.
