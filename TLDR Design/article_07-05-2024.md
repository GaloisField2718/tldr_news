 YOUTUBE APPEARS TO REVERSE CONTROVERSIAL UI REDESIGN AFTER BACKLASH
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube may have decided not to roll out its most recent UI redesign
after backlash on Reddit and X, where users questioned the
practicality of the overly cluttered new look. The redesigned UI
places video recommendations and the Shorts shelf below the video
player, taking up space generally used for video details and comments.
While most people now see the traditional layout, some have reported
still seeing the trial layout. 

 INSTAGRAM INTRODUCES NEW INTERACTIVE STICKERS FOR STORIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Music, photos, and videos can now be shared more interactively on
Instagram. A new feature called Reveal blurs the contents of a story
post, preventing viewers from seeing it unless they DM the person who
shared it. Another feature, Frames, overlays Polaroid images on
grayscale images that turn into pictures when you shake the phone.
Instagram will add a music template feature that lets users post songs
directly to their stories using prompts. 

 BETTER SIRI IS COMING: WHAT APPLE'S RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT ITS AI PLANS
(9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's AI approach focuses on practical uses and improving user
experiences rather than just showcasing technological prowess. A group
of Apple researchers has been working on a way to use Siri without
needing to use a wake word. Instead of listening for ‚ÄúHey Siri,‚Äù
the device might be able to intuit whether the user is talking to it.
It will also know whether the user is asking a follow-up or new
question.

 HOW TO RUN UX RESEARCH WITHOUT ACCESS TO USERS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sometimes, you can't access users because of legal restrictions, high
costs, or because they still need to be created. Still, there are a
few workarounds that help us better understand users' pain points and
issues. These strategies include connecting with people in your
organization who regularly communicate with customers, accessing
analytics, CRM reports, and call center logs and reading reviews,
discussions, and comments about your product and its competitors. 

 DESIGNING WITH THE BRAIN IN MIND: THE ROLE OF COLOUR AND SHAPE IN UX
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many studies have consistently shown that color and shape can
influence user behavior and create feelings. The findings of a new
study shed light on how our brains may respond to digital stimuli
differently based on evolutionary psychology and neuroimaging. As a
result of its insights, designers are advised to use color judiciously
and align with brand identity, choose rounded shapes, and minimize
cognitive strain by implementing calming colors, clear and concise
content, intuitive navigation, and clutter-free layouts.

 UNDERPROMISING AND OVERDELIVERING IN THE AGE OF THE SOFTWARE-DEFINED

 Car companies like Tesla, GM, and Volkswagen have recently released
unfinished or ill-conceived products, possibly risking their
reputations or even customers' safety, while asking people to trust
completely new technologies. Automobile quality and safety standards

 DESIGNSHIFTS: A BETTER FUTURE FOR AND THROUGH DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The applications that designers build are contributing to an
expanding mental health crisis, and the messages they craft are making
people buy more while feeling less and less satisfied. Through an
intentional shift, designers can move design from a tool contributing

rebuilds, and reconnects.
