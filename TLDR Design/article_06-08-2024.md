 RUNWAY ANNOUNCES EVEN FASTER, CHEAPER AI VIDEO MODEL GEN-3 ALPHA
TURBO (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 New York-based startup Runway has launched Gen-3 Alpha Turbo, a
faster and more affordable version of its AI video model. This new
model is reportedly seven times faster than the original Gen-3 Alpha,
enabling nearly real-time video generation. Despite its speed and
reduced cost, Runway faces scrutiny over its AI training practices,
particularly concerning the use of copyrighted content.

 TIKTOK LITE: EU CLOSES ADDICTIVE DESIGN CASE AFTER TIKTOK COMMITS TO
NOT BRING BACK REWARDS MECHANISM (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TikTok has withdrawn its ‚ÄúTask and reward‚Äù feature, which allowed
users to earn points for in-app activities that could be exchanged for
Amazon vouchers. This feature raised concerns about stimulating
addictive behavior among young users. TikTok has agreed not to
reintroduce the feature under a different guise and could face
significant penalties if it fails to comply. The EC will monitor
TikTok's adherence to these commitments. A separate investigation into
TikTok's main app's algorithm and its potential harmful effects is
still ongoing.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNING DEPTH (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 "Dirtying the frame" creates depth in visual media by using
foreground elements, while in software design, depth is added through
blurring, ambient objects, and choreographed motion. Techniques like
staggering motion and indicating affordance through movement enhance
user interaction. 

 TACTICS FOR RETENTION (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Retention involves users repeatedly engaging with an app, driven by
intrinsic motivation or external rewards like notifications. Effective
strategies include well-timed push notifications, creative use of
streaks and status, and increasing visibility through live activities,
app-icon badges, and home screen widgets. 

 INSTRUMENTAL INTERFACES, ENGAGED INTERFACES (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Human interfaces in software serve as intermediaries between human
intentions and computer knowledge. These interfaces can be categorized
as instrumental, focusing on efficiently solving specific problems, or
engaged, offering value through deep interaction. Effective design
requires understanding the balance between these types and exploring
ways to enhance user engagement through interaction.

 DESIGN AIN'T A DEMOCRACY (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Democratic decision-making often leads to slow and ineffective
product development in tech companies. A clear decision-maker can help
ideas to continue and progress to thrive. Great design thrives under a
single visionary leader who can make decisive choices, set standards,
and drive the product forward. Unlike tech companies, the video game
industry succeeds by empowering directors to own and guide every
aspect of the product.
