custom digital invitations with seamless Apple ecosystem integration.

iCloud syncing, making event planning more visually appealing and

 MARVEL DENIES USING AI FOR ‘FANTASTIC FOUR' POSTER (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Marvel has denied accusations that its newly released Fantastic Four
teaser poster was generated using AI following online speculation
about its design. Critics pointed to certain stylistic elements that
resembled AI-generated art, sparking debate among fans and industry
professionals. Marvel insists the artwork was created by human
designers, reaffirming its commitment to traditional design methods. 

 CAN AI ART BE COPYRIGHTED? NOT IF THERE'S NO HUMAN INPUT, US OFFICE
SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The U.S. Copyright Office has reaffirmed that AI-generated art
without significant human input cannot be copyrighted, reinforcing its
stance on human authorship as a requirement. This decision follows
growing debates over AI's role in creative fields as artists and
companies seek clarity on intellectual property rights. While
AI-assisted works may still qualify if a human plays a key role in the
creative process, fully autonomous AI creations remain ineligible for
legal protection.

 HOW TO OVERCOME BLANK PAGE SYNDROME, A LUXURY DESIGNERS CAN'T AFFORD
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generative AI makes blank page syndrome a luxury designers can't
afford. Design isn't art - it's about driving user behavior. Focusing
on measurable objectives helps narrow choices and prevent creative
paralysis. Clear prompts and constraints enhance creativity, ensuring
designs serve business goals while maintaining quality. AI can assist,
but human-driven problem-solving remains essential. 

 HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE SHAPES FOR IMPACTFUL CREATIVE DESIGNS (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Geometric shapes influence design by guiding users, evoking emotions,
and reinforcing branding. Squares provide stability, circles suggest
continuity, and triangles imply movement. Combining shapes with colors
and patterns enhances engagement. Strategic use of shapes in layouts,
logos, and websites improves user experience and retention, making
designs more effective and visually compelling. 

 DEAR DESIGNERS: WHAT COPYWRITERS WANT YOU TO KNOW (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Great design and copywriting go hand in hand. Writers and designers
stress collaboration, trust, and early involvement for effective
branding. Strong verbal identity matters as much as visuals, requiring
precise, flexible briefs. Copywriters value strategic input and detest
being an afterthought.

 BRING BACK THE BEZELS (11 MINUTE READ) [15]

experiences.
