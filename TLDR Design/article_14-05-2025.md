 HOW MOTION DESIGN AFFECTS UX (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Effective motion design enhances interface usability and user
engagement. It offers feedback, clarifies transitions, guides focus,
shows state changes, and shapes product identity, making interfaces
intuitive and memorable. Good motion design needs a clear purpose,
subtlety, consistency, technical feasibility, and accessibility for
motion-sensitive users. 

 SMASHING ANIMATIONS PART 1: HOW CLASSIC CARTOONS INSPIRE MODERN CSS
(14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Andy Clarke's modern CSS animations for composer Mike Worth's site
were inspired by classic Hanna Barbera cartoon methods. Early
animators used looping backgrounds, minimal frames, and layering to
save costs like CSS animations today. These principles use CSS, SVG,
and keyframes to add ambient effects, feedback, and storytelling while
keeping performance high. 

 95% OF HOMEPAGES ARE INACCESSIBLE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Global Accessibility Awareness Day stresses the need for digital
products accessible to people with disabilities, yet 95 percent of
websites fail basic WCAG standards. Common issues, like low contrast
text and missing alt text, block users needing screen readers or
keyboard navigation. Designers and developers can prevent this with
better practices, handoffs, and free accessibility tools, creating a
more inclusive web for all.

 WHAT COLOUR BLIND DESIGNERS CAN TEACH US ABOUT SEEING DIFFERENTLY:
THE HIDDEN ADVANTAGE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Colour blindness, often seen as a design limitation, can enhance
focus on essentials like structure, contrast, and usability.
Throughout history and across fields like science, military, and art,
those who perceive differently have uncovered insights others
overlook. Designing from the perspective of outliers, rather than the
assumed “average” user, leads to more inclusive and effective
solutions for all.
