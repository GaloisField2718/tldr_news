OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DEFINITION OF "GOOD" (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Defining "good" design is crucial for alignment, efficiency, and
high-quality outcomes. The definition should adapt to the project's
goals and context. Collaborate early with stakeholders, establish
design principles, and foster a structured critique process to
maintain shared standards and focus. 

 HOW DID YOU PICK THAT TYPEFACE? (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Decision-making is crucial in design. Typeface selection involves
balancing brand guidelines, client needs, and project goals.
Practicing this skill helps designers grow, adapt to challenges, and
understand the impact of their choices in shaping outcomes. 

 WHY SIMPLE UX STORIES ARE BEST: THE POWER OF CLARIFYING AMBIGUITY (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Effective UX design involves simplifying complex problems into
explicit, compelling stories. Designers clarify ambiguity, ask
critical questions, and transform vague requirements into tangible
outputs. Highlighting user struggles, employing systematic design
processes, and communicating solutions effectively makes portfolios
resonate with busy interviewers and showcase the designer's ability to
simplify and solve complex challenges.

 DESIGN TOKENS: AUTHORING VS CONSUMING (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design tokens facilitate the connection between design and code,
though there are challenges when using them such as naming conventions
and rigid hierarchies. A taxonomy-driven approach could improve
flexibility, standardization, and adaptability, eliminating the need
for manual token naming. Using unique identifiers (UIDs) in authoring
systems ensures stability, allowing token evolution while preserving
relationships. This method helps future-proof design systems against
inevitable changes. 

 HOW TO SURVIVE A CLIENT MEETING WHEN THEY SAY ‘MAKE IT POP'!!!! (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Designers frequently encounter cryptic client requests like “make
it pop.” When this happens, it is essential to maintain facial
neutrality, interpret the vague demand, work with chaotic color
schemes, and add sparkle. The process will often involve numerous
tweaks and font debates, with exclamation points as an expected
outcome. 

 SHOULD ICONS SCALE IN BIGGER BREAKPOINTS? (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Making icons scale correctly ensures clarity across devices and
screen sizes. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) provide crisp visuals,
adapting seamlessly without pixelation. For raster images like PNGs,
srcset, and breakpoints, dynamic image loading can be enabled based on
screen resolution. Proper scaling enhances the user experience and
makes apps seem higher quality.
