NEWS & TRENDS

 LEAKER REVEALS IPHONE 18 COLOR OPTIONS. THINK PURPLE, RED, AND THAT'S
THAT ME ESPRESSO. (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A Chinese leaker claims the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max will come in
three colors—coffee, purple, and wine red—continuing Apple's
recent trend of omitting a standard black option. While the iPhone 17
Pro's lack of black drew criticism, Apple may have avoided it due to
the scratch-prone anodized aluminum finish. These new color rumors
remain unconfirmed ahead of next year's launch. 

 NETFLIX LAUNCHES REDESIGNED PROFILES FOR KIDS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix redesigned its kids' profiles globally, introducing
simplified navigation and a new "My Netflix" section that consolidates
watched, saved, and loved content for easier access to favorites. The
update includes real-time refreshing of recommendations to reduce
browsing time, while maintaining existing features such as Character
Themed Rows, Mystery Box suggestions, and parental controls. This
follows Netflix's May redesign of standard profiles and supports the
streaming service's expansion into interactive content, such as
real-time voting and live party games. 

 ANIME STUDIOS ARE FINALLY FIGHTING BACK AGAINST AI SLOP (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Japanese anime studios, represented by the Content Overseas
Distribution Association, have formally requested that OpenAI cease
using their copyrighted works to train AI programs, such as Sora,
without permission. The action follows a massive 2025 trend of
"Ghiblifying" photos using ChatGPT to create Studio Ghibli-style
images, which allegedly influenced AI's characteristic yellowish tone
in subsequent outputs. Studios argue these AI-generated images strip
away the hundreds of hours of artistic labor that define anime as
irreplaceable cultural treasures.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY THE TRADITIONAL UX PROCESS HOLDS DESIGNERS BACK (14 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The traditional UX design process creates a comforting but misleading
framework that suggests following the correct sequence will guarantee
great user experiences. In reality, UX work is messy and iterative,
involving loops, zigzags, and constant backtracking as teams discover
new insights, redefine problems mid-project, and adapt to constraints
like budget, time, and regulatory requirements. Rather than rigidly
adhering to prescribed stages, teams should embrace adaptive workflows
that prioritize experimentation, continuous user feedback,
outcome-focused work, and flexibility to revisit assumptions at any
point in the process. 

 MOBILE TO MODELS AND LEADING DESIGN WITH CRAFT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI requires design leaders to engage directly with the material
rather than delegate, as breakthroughs are behavioral rather than
spatial, unlike mobile interface challenges. Traditional evaluation
systems built for deterministic software fail to measure what matters
now—tone, contextual awareness, and behavioral consistency—leaving
experiences that resolve issues but feel hollow. Leaders must develop
hands-on fluency with models, establish new quality standards through
experimentation, and translate discoveries into principles that guide
teams toward craft excellence. 

 COCA-COLA'S NEW AI HOLIDAY AD IS A SLOPPY EYESORE (2 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Coca-Cola has released a new AI-generated holiday campaign that
replaces humans with animated animals but still looks awkward and
artificial, despite technical improvements over last year's criticized
AI ads. The company says the campaign was faster and cheaper to
produce, reflecting its growing reliance on AI in marketing even as
concerns mount over quality, authenticity, and the impact on creative
jobs.

 WHY YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM TEAM NEEDS CLAUDE SKILLS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Claude Skills addresses the "context pollution" problem in AI
conversations by loading information only when needed for specific
tasks. Unlike Projects, Skills define reusable workflows for
performing tasks, such as validating design tokens, auditing
accessibility, or generating documentation. There are five practical
design system applications: token naming helpers that enforce
consistent patterns, validators that check references and naming
conventions, accessibility auditors that use deterministic scripts for
accurate calculations, component documentation generators that
maintain consistent style, and brand guidelines enforcers. 

 HOW TO BUILD VISUAL CONFIDENCE AS A DESIGNER (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many designers struggle not from a lack of talent, but from a lack of
conviction, endlessly tweaking instead of trusting their decisions.
Visual confidence—the ability to make design choices quickly through
trained pattern recognition—is built through high output volume,
intentional study of references, and learning from outcomes rather
than seeking approval. Real confidence is evident in restraint and
clarity, resulting in work that feels grounded and inevitable, rather
than trying to impress.
