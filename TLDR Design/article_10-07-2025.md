NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE JUST PATENTED A TRACKBALL APPLE PENCIL THAT WORKS ON ALMOST ANY
SURFACE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple has been granted a patent for a next-generation Apple Pencil
equipped with optical sensors that can track motion, orientation, and
position in 3D space, allowing users to draw on any surface—or even
in mid-air—without needing a touchscreen. The stylus may feature
technologies like optical flow sensors, laser speckle tracking,
internal trackballs, and other advanced sensors, signaling Apple's
ongoing push toward spatial computing beyond traditional devices like
the iPad. 

 FIGMA ANNOUNCED NEW GRID UPDATES (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma has released new updates to its grid beta feature, providing
designers with enhanced precision and control capabilities. The
improvements include the ability to delete rows and columns directly
on the canvas, set minimum and maximum resize parameters for both
grids and objects within them, and efficiently adjust multiple grids
simultaneously using a faster grid picker tool. These updates
streamline the grid editing workflow by offering more granular control
over grid layouts and batch editing functionality. 

 APPLE DESIGN TEAM TO START REPORTING DIRECTLY TO TIM COOK LATER THIS
YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple COO Jeff Williams will retire later this year, with Sabih Khan
taking over the COO role this month. Until his retirement, Williams
will continue overseeing the design team, Apple Watch, and Health
initiatives. After Williams steps down, Apple's design team—which he
took over after Jony Ive's departure—will report directly to CEO Tim
Cook, marking a notable leadership shift in Apple's design structure.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE SECRET OF GOOD METAPHORS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Throughout history, our understanding of complex systems, such as the
brain, has been shaped by contemporary technologies, from hydraulic
mechanisms in Descartes' era to modern AI neural networks. Xerox's
breakthrough paper metaphor made computers accessible by mapping
unfamiliar digital concepts onto familiar office experiences, while
smartphones later adopted physics-based interactions. Effective
metaphors don't merely explain, they transform thinking by bridging
the unfamiliar with intimate, human-scale experiences, although
cultural assumptions about universality must be questioned. 

 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GIVE UP ON THE CREATIVE INDUSTRY JUST YET (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The creative industry faces significant challenges, including
economic uncertainty, AI disruption, and tighter budgets, leaving many
professionals exhausted and questioning their futures. Despite these
difficulties, the industry isn't dying but transforming, presenting
opportunities for those willing to adapt by diversifying services,
building stronger networks, and focusing on authentic human creativity
that AI cannot replicate. Rather than abandoning their careers,
creatives should view this rebuilding phase as an opportunity to
create a more sustainable industry while also recognizing that human
creativity remains essential and valuable. 

 WHY DESIGNERS SOUND NEGATIVE (AND WHY THAT'S A GOOD THING) (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 In fast-paced product teams, designers who raise concerns are often
mislabeled as negative, when in fact they're using “defensive
pessimism”—a strategic, experience-driven effort to anticipate and
prevent failure. While confidence and optimism dominate
decision-making cultures, it's the cautious voices—often dismissed
or ignored—that provide essential foresight to ensure ambitious
plans actually succeed in the real world.

 DESIGNING ONBOARDING MICROINTERACTIONS: GUIDE (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This guide explores onboarding microinteractions, small design
elements that respond to user actions and create smoother first
experiences. Effective microinteractions maintain simplicity through
single-purpose interactions, provide immediate contextual feedback,
and use motion carefully with durations of 200-300ms. Designing them
properly involves identifying key onboarding moments, defining
triggers and feedback, prototyping with tools like UXPin, and
iterating based on user testing. 

 DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR BETTER NOTIFICATIONS UX (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Notifications often create disruption and fatigue due to their high
frequency, but they can be improved by designing for different
severity levels and starting with slow, steady delivery rates.
Facebook's research showed that reducing notification frequency
initially decreased traffic but ultimately improved user satisfaction
and long-term engagement. Effective notification UX encompasses
setting up notification modes, integrating frequency options into
onboarding, and enabling users to snooze or pause notifications as
needed. 

 ON DYSON, TECHNO-CENTRIC DESIGN AND SOCIAL CONSUMPTION (13 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Dyson's design approach prioritizes technology and visual impact over
usability, leading to products that are often uncomfortable,
impractical, or unnecessarily complex. The brand's emphasis on
innovation and the myth of the “star designer” support a culture
of flashy, tech-driven consumption, which ultimately undermines more
thoughtful, collaborative, and user-focused design.
