 WHY THE 4-POINT GRID SYSTEM DOMINATES UI DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The 4-point grid system is a UI design staple that balances
proportional scaling, micro/macro element precision, and cross-device
consistency. Its divisibility ensures harmonious layouts, avoids
fractional pixels, and simplifies scaling. While alternatives like
2-point and 5-point grids offer unique benefits, the 4-point grid
remains the go-to choice for versatile and consistent interfaces. 

 IMPROVING CUSTOMER ACQUISITION WITH GREAT UX (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) often overlooks UX's role in
retention and satisfaction. Poor UX inflates costs by causing churn,
requiring increased marketing spend. Investments in onboarding,
reducing Time to Value, and optimizing user journeys significantly
enhance retention, reduce churn, and improve long-term growth.

calculated effort to shake off irrelevance and reignite interest in
the modern luxury market. While critics decry the changes, the move,
prioritizing attention and future growth over nostalgia, underscores

luxury brand.
