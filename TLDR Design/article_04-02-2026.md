NEWS & TRENDS

 OPENAI'S SORA APP IS STRUGGLING AFTER ITS STELLAR LAUNCH (4 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's Sora video-generation app experienced a dramatic decline
after its stellar October launch, with downloads dropping 32% in
December and 45% in January despite initially reaching 1 million
downloads faster than ChatGPT. Consumer spending also fell 32% month
over month in January, with the app dropping from the top spot in the
US App Store to No. 101 overall. The decline is attributed to
increased competition from Google's Gemini and Meta AI, as well as
ongoing copyright infringement issues. 

 ADOBE ANIMATE IS SHUTTING DOWN AS COMPANY FOCUSES ON AI (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Adobe is shutting down its long-running 2D animation tool Adobe
Animate as it continues to reorient its product lineup around AI, with
the software set to be discontinued on March 1. While enterprise
customers will receive extended support through 2029, many users are
frustrated by the lack of a true replacement and Adobe's suggestion to
piece together Animate features using other Creative Cloud apps. The
move follows months of signals that Animate was being deprioritized,
including its absence from Adobe Max and the lack of a 2025 release. 

 ALL-NEW MACBOOK PRO DESIGN REPORTEDLY SET TO LAUNCH IN FINAL QUARTER
THIS YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is expected to launch updated MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro
and M5 Max chips soon, keeping the current design but delivering major
performance gains, likely alongside macOS 26.3. A larger update,
expected in Q4, will introduce a slimmer redesigned MacBook Pro with
Samsung-made OLED displays in 14- and 16-inch sizes, possibly a
punch-hole camera, and even touch support, though some Apple-specific
components are still being finalized.

wireframe translations, and complex dashboard interfaces through

effectively communicate structure and aesthetic direction. 

 HOW TO BUILD A CREATIVE BRAND STRATEGY THAT ACTUALLY CONVERTS (14
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A creative brand strategy is a structured plan that uses storytelling
and creative ideas to define how a brand expresses its identity and
differentiates itself from competitors. It strengthens market position
by providing clarity that makes your brand the obvious choice rather
than just another option, while attracting the right customers who are
already halfway sold because your brand resonates with them. The
strategy builds emotional connections by understanding how customers
actually think, leading to stronger preference and loyalty over time.

 AGENT ORCHESTRATION UI (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI products have evolved from behind-the-scenes models to chat

agents coordinate on unified tasks. Intent by Augment introduces a new
UI approach for agent orchestration that focuses on workspaces,

maintaining alignment through shared context. 

 HOW TO MANAGE BREAKING CHANGES IN DESIGN TOKENS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design systems require a three-phase approach to manage breaking
changes in design tokens: deprecation, migration, and removal. During
deprecation, mark tokens with flags and provide clear timelines;
during migration, offer both old and new tokens with guides and tools;
and during removal, clean up deprecated tokens in a major version
release. Success depends on clear communication, adequate migration
periods, and proper documentation throughout the process.
