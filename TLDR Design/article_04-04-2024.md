better," but how do we know if our "less" achieves "better"? We have
to view it in the context of "more." Start with the fullness of the
idea: the whole "bull." Get something tangible before people first,
even if it's not the final form. Then, systematically refine and
distill it to its purest essence over time.

disruptive devices that can blend in with people's environment without
becoming a disturbance.
