SUBSCRIBERS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Headspace has introduced Ebb, a generative AI-powered chatbot
designed to provide personalized support for mental health issues
using motivational interviewing techniques. The chatbot has two main

content or prompting gratitude reflections. Ebb cannot give direct
mental health advice but will provide crisis hotline information if a
user seems at immediate risk. Headspace is considering expanding Ebb's
memory and integrating it more deeply with its professional care
services to improve user experience.
