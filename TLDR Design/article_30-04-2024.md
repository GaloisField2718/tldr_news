 VARIABLES IN FIGMA (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma variables empower designers to store and share design values
across documents and libraries, like color and spacing, promoting
consistency and efficiency in element styling and layout. This

 MY PRODUCT PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This product prioritization framework emphasizes four core areas:
invest, ignore, de-emphasize, and deprecate. It encourages the scaling
of successful products and features while monitoring and maintaining
areas that don't require immediate attention. The framework can be
applied in various contexts, such as personal audits, cross-functional
workshops, or strategic planning, to enhance decision-making
efficiency. 

 A GOOD IMAGE TELLS A GOOD STORY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers should select visuals for their presentations with the same
care as they choose their words. If a visual lacks meaning, it becomes
a decorative placeholder. It can dilute the message, distract from
what they want to say, and even express disrespect to their audience.

 THE POLISH PARADOX (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The term "polish" encapsulates meticulous design details, like
professional electricians' vertical screw alignment and subtle
adjustments in traditional go boards and typefaces. In UI design, it's
evident in smooth animations and intuitive interactions, exemplified
by the iPhone's keyboard adjustments, which are essential for
elevating products from good to great. 

 A GUIDE TO SELECTING AN ACCESSIBLE TYPEFACE (6 MINUTE READ) [15]

spacing.
