 STUDIO GHIBLI MEMES SHOW OPENAI'S NEW IMAGE GENERATOR IS OUT OF
CONTROL (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI is under fire again, this time for turning memes and historic
moments into Studio Ghibli-style art, despite Ghibli legend Hayao
Miyazaki's well-known dislike for AI-generated images. The trend has
taken off on social media, with people using OpenAI's latest tool to
give everything from personal photos to political events a whimsical,
animated twist. While some AI tools limit style mimicry, OpenAI
appears to replicate the iconic Ghibli look convincingly without
restriction. 

 THE LUMON TERMINAL PRO COMPUTER POPS UP ON APPLE'S WEBSITE (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple has added the fictional Lumon Terminal Pro computer from its
hit show Severance to its retail website, but it's not for sale. The
listing serves as a clever promotion for Apple TV+, which is bundled
as a free three-month trial with Mac purchases, tying into Apple's
broader push into services. Apple has launched several
Severance-themed promotions, including a behind-the-scenes short film,
free content, and more.

CIRCLES IN IOS 19 (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

While developers can adapt, the change raises usability concerns and
invites discussion. 

 THE DEATH OF DRIBBBLE: WHY DESIGNERS ABANDONED THEIR FAVORITE
PLATFORM (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dribbble, once a thriving design community, has faded due to business
decisions that prioritize profit over creativity. New policies
restricted designer exposure, and monetization efforts alienated
users. Some argue that the design industry has changed, now favoring
systematization over experimentation. Alternatives like Contra are
emerging, but whether design culture can reclaim its past vibrancy
remains uncertain.
