developers with innovative apps like Copilot Money and Procreate

 ONLY 30 SECONDS TO REJECT YOUR PORTFOLIO? (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Common mistakes designers should avoid making in their UX portfolios
include using low-resolution images, making spelling mistakes, writing
generic titles, failing to capture readers' attention, failing to
establish context, presenting case studies that are too long, using
‚Äúwe‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI,‚Äù and using a checklist template instead of
telling a story. 

 THE REASONS WHY YOUR TEAM IS NOT LISTENING TO YOU (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A team might not listen to a designer's or researcher's ideas due to
perceived managerial incompetence, communication issues, misaligned
incentives, and prioritization of other factors over research. New
ideas or people can be seen as disruptive and their benefits may not
be immediately clear to the team.

 WHAT GPT-4O MEANS FOR DESIGNERS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI has announced GPT-4o, a new multimodal AI model that accepts
and generates text, audio, and image inputs through a single neural
network, enhancing efficiency and reducing information loss. GPT-4o
offers faster feedback, detects and processes visual cues, and can be
used in various design processes, potentially revolutionizing AI's
role in design. 

 DESIGN TOKENS AND VARIABLES (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Design tokens and variables link names to specific values but differ
in scope and purpose. While variables in programming can hold dynamic
values and are specific to certain environments like CSS or Sass,
design tokens represent design decisions applied consistently across
platforms. This distinction ensures a uniform look and feel, with
design tokens acting as a technology-agnostic source of truth, unlike
tool-specific variables in Figma or Sketch.
