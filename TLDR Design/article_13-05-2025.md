READ) [4]

to import, edit photos, and generate images via text and region
editing. Launching days after Adobe's similar product, it uses tech

 THE BIBLE, REDESIGNED FOR THE INSTAGRAM AGE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Byble project reimagines the ancient book with separate volumes

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HUMAN AFTER ALL (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As AI and no-code tools advance fast, the real challenge is shifting
our mindset to curiosity over fear and exploring with openness, not
resistance. The edge lies not in technical skills alone but in human
traits like judgment, empathy, connection, communication, experience,
creativity, and curiosity. We must build these strengths to complement
machines, not compete with them to stay relevant. 

 THE SLOW BURN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A poorly designed button that forced registration before purchase
cost an e-commerce company $300 million, showing how minor UX flaws
can cause significant losses. Unlike technical debt, UX debt often
goes unseen but harms trust, raises support costs, and lowers loyalty.
The fix is to spot, track, and resolve UX issues with audits, focused
sprints, and a culture that treats user experience as a business
priority. 

 THE SECRET TO EFFECTIVE UX WORKSHOPS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX workshops boost careers by helping designers align stakeholders
and solve problems faster. Key types include Problem Framing,
Prioritization, Empathy Mapping, Rapid Ideation, and Future Visioning.
Success needs clear expectations, strict timeboxing, smart participant
choices, and flexibility.
