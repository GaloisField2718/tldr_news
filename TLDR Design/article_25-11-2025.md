NEWS & TRENDS

 INTRODUCING REPLIT DESIGN MODE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Replit's Design Mode is powered by Google's new Gemini 3 model. It
enables users to create interactive mockups and static websites in
under two minutes through natural language commands. The feature
serves both as a rapid prototyping tool for designers and product
managers, and as a faster alternative to website builders like Wix or
Squarespace for creating deployable sites. Users can convert their
front-end designs into full-stack applications with backend
functionality by clicking "Convert to App." The entire development
process happens within Replit's workspace. 

 GOOGLE AI MODE IS STILL TESTING SHOWING ADS IN SEARCH RESULTS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is testing ads in its Gemini-powered AI Mode search results,
placing sponsored cards at the bottom of pages rather than at the top
like traditional searches. The company confirmed these intermittent
ads are part of ongoing tests announced in May, with no new updates to
AI Mode's ad distribution currently. Organic link cards now appear
within Gemini's answer above the ads, and unlike traditional search,
there's no option to hide sponsored results in AI Mode. 

 AI TOOK CENTRE STAGE AT ADOBE MAX LA 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe MAX LA 2025 showcased Adobe's push to make AI a powerful
assistant rather than a replacement, integrating conversational agents
across Photoshop, Firefly, and Express to handle repetitive tasks
through plain-language commands. Major updates included the advanced
Firefly Image Model 5, refined generative tools in Creative Cloud, new
video features like AI Object Mask, and enterprise solutions such as
GenStudio and Firefly Foundry—aimed at speeding up workflows while
keeping creative control firmly with humans.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GENERATIVE UI FROM GEMINI 3 PRO (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's Gemini 3 Pro introduces Generative UI, where AI creates
custom interfaces on the fly for individual users. Test users
preferred these over traditional websites 90% of the time. Human
designers currently edge out AI designs by just 56% to 43%, but this
narrow margin is expected to disappear by late 2026 as AI capabilities
double roughly every seven months while human design skills stagnate.
Google plans to roll out Generative UI to its five billion search
users, marking a shift from expensive, permanent interfaces toward
cheap, disposable, individualized interactions generated instantly for
specific user needs. 

 HUMAN ENGINEERING (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Human engineering is a multidisciplinary field focused on designing
systems, technologies, and environments that make correct actions
intuitive and errors difficult, rather than relying on training or
willpower. This article illustrates this through everyday examples
like stovetop configurations and "Norman Doors," demonstrating how
poor spatial compatibility and discoverability lead to common mistakes
that stem from design failures rather than human error. By applying
principles such as natural mapping, affordances, and constraints,
human engineering reduces cognitive load and creates systems where
ordinary human performance produces excellent results at minimal cost.


 QUALITY OF DESIGN EDUCATION "LOWER THAN IT WAS" SAY DESIGNERS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design education has deteriorated: it's more expensive, less
connected to industry, and leaves graduates unprepared and in debt.
Too many under-resourced courses lack real-world experience,
sustainability training, and adequately supported teachers, suggesting
that many skills can now be self-taught and that the traditional
university model may need to be rebuilt entirely.

 12 TOP DESIGNERS TELL US HOW THEY MADE IT (23 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Twelve established designers, including Philippe Starck and Yinka
Ilori, candidly share how they broke into the industry, revealing
stories of patience, side jobs, and serendipitous connections that
launched their careers. Many express concern about today's design
landscape, citing reduced funding, expensive trade shows, and
inadequate education as major barriers for emerging designers compared
to when they started. Despite these challenges, the designers note
that social media and independent approaches have created new
pathways, with Instagram facilitating collaborations and designers
increasingly bypassing traditional trade shows to take control of
their own work presentation. 

 WHEN NATURAL LANGUAGE FEELS UNNATURAL (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT popularized natural language as a consumer interface in late
2023, but chat's dominance as the primary AI interaction method may be
temporary, much like command-line interfaces before graphical user
interfaces emerged. While natural language excels for knowledge work
and coding, where ambiguity is tolerable, it struggles with precision
tasks, leading to unwanted rewrites and misinterpretations that reveal
chat as an incomplete interface layer. The field awaits its "Mother of
All Demos" moment—a breakthrough that integrates multimodal inputs,
contextual affordances, and dynamic interfaces into a new interaction
grammar beyond simple text prompts. 

 NINETY YEARS OF PENGUIN: HOW TYPOGRAPHY BUILT A PUBLISHING ICON (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Penguin's identity has always been rooted in typography, evolving
from early consistent paperbacks to Jan Tschichold's 1940s philosophy
of clarity, structure, and reader-centered design. Across
decades—from Gill Sans modernism to Helvetica's international style
to later post-modern experimentation—Penguin has adapted to cultural
and technological change while preserving its core values of clarity,
consistency, and respectful communication, showing how typography can
shape both reading and culture itself.

mural featuring distorted faces, malformed snowmen, and chimeric
creatures that locals compared to "Lovecraftian horror."
