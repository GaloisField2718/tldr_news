 LEAKER DOUBLES DOWN ON TWO KEY DISPLAY CHANGES FOR THE IPHONE 18 PRO
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models are expected to keep the same screen
sizes as recent models, but will likely introduce under-display Face
ID and a smaller front camera cutout using HIAA (hole-in-active-area)
technology. This could mark the first iPhone without a visible Face ID
area and possibly feature an asymmetrically placed front camera in the
top-left corner of the screen. 

 VIBE CODING FEVER: SOLO ENTREPRENEUR'S BASE44 ACQUIRED BY WIX FOR $80
MILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Wix acquired Israeli startup Base44 for $80 million, with potential
increases based on revenue targets through 2029. The AI app-building
platform was founded by 31-year-old Maor Shlomo as a side project
after military reserve duty, attracting over 100,000 users within
months. Base44's no-code tool allows users to create apps and games
through simple text prompts, generating $189,000 in recent profits
with just six employees. 

 ADOBE LAUNCHES A NEW ‘COMPUTATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY' CAMERA APP FOR
IPHONES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe's Project Indigo is a free computational photography camera app
for newer iPhones that captures multiple photos and combines them for
enhanced image quality. The app was developed by Marc Levoy, a former
Google Pixel camera engineer. It offers manual controls while
producing natural, SLR-like photos with reduced noise and higher
dynamic range. Adobe plans to expand the app with features like
Android support, portrait mode, and video recording to build an
integrated mobile photography experience.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 APPROACHING AI AS A DESIGN LEADER: RETHINKING THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY
WITH A LAYER OF AI-FIRST (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To drive meaningful transformation with an AI-first approach, start
by mapping a specific area of the customer journey in detail, focusing
on five layers: the customer's perspective, internal team workflows,
low-impact customer tasks, communication touchpoints, and reimagined
possibilities in an AI-native world. Prioritize areas where AI can add
value, collaborate across teams, and treat the customer journey as a
living system that evolves with organizational maturity and
technological capability. 

 THE MYTH OF GOOD TASTE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Relying on "taste" in product management introduces subjective biases
rooted in cultural norms, often distracting from core goals like
functionality, accessibility, and user value. A craft-based approach
— focused on deliberate, inclusive, and ethical design choices —
ensures that products are genuinely useful, equitable, and
sustainable, rather than just aesthetically appealing or superficially
impressive. 

 BE A SKILL SURFER (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 "Skill Surfing" involves navigating careers by following curiosity
rather than predetermined plans and adapting to changing opportunities
like surfers ride waves. This approach emphasizes testing new skills
through hands-on practice, focusing on one area at a time, and
maintaining patience during extended learning periods. The method
prioritizes continuous growth and flexibility over traditional linear
career planning.

 DOES USING CIRCLES MAKE A BETTER LOGO DESIGN? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 While circles have symbolic and aesthetic appeal, their use as
overlays in logo presentations—often seen in redesigns—has sparked
debate among designers. Some see them as helpful tools for visual
consistency or client persuasion, while others argue they're often
post-rationalizations used to add credibility or visual flair without
real design benefit. 

 DESIGNING FOR SERIAL TASK SWITCHING (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 True multitasking is a myth. What users do is serial task switching,
rapidly shifting attention between tasks, which increases errors,
reduces productivity, and heightens stress. Designing for this reality
means creating interfaces that support flexibility, reduce friction,
and help users stay oriented through features like split screens,
background task handling, and clear navigation, while also including
safeguards like undo options and confirmation dialogs to mitigate
common mistakes. 

 AI DESIGN WORKFLOW (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Designers increasingly integrate AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude
into their workflows for ideation, research analysis, and UX
optimization rather than fearing replacement. Adaptive designers use
AI as a "second brain" to enhance creativity and efficiency across
tasks like generating feature ideas, analyzing user interviews, and
crafting microcopy. Success depends on designers evolving to leverage
AI strategically while maintaining their unique human advantages in
empathy, context, and storytelling.
