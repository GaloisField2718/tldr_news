 INTRODUCING AMAZON LENS LIVE: INSTANT SCANNING, REAL-TIME PRODUCT
MATCHES, AND INSIGHTS FROM AMAZON'S AI SHOPPING ASSISTANT (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Amazon's Lens Live is an AI-powered visual search feature that
instantly scans products and displays real-time matches in a swipeable
carousel. The feature integrates Rufus, Amazon's AI shopping
assistant, to provide product insights, summaries, and answer
questions while browsing through the camera view. Lens Live is now

 I HATE MINIMALIST BRANDING BUT BLANK STREET HAS WON ME OVER (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Blank Street, a Gen Z-favoured coffee brand, has unveiled a
minimalist rebrand with Wolff Olins, positioning itself as a global
lifestyle brand. The new identity introduces a “window” motif,
custom typography, and a signature “Blank Street Green” palette,
balancing sophistication with playfulness while building a scalable,
future-proof look.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW DID REBRAND BECOME SUCH A DIRTY WORD? (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The word “rebrand” has become loaded and often avoided, with many
companies instead framing changes as a “brand refresh” to reduce
resistance. Designers note that non-creative stakeholders can be
spooked by the idea of a rebrand, associating it with layoffs,
restructuring, or failures. High-profile controversies like Jaguar and
Cracker Barrel amplified this, as debates reduced rebrands to “new
logo” battles in the mainstream. In reality, most branding work
focuses on evolution rather than total reinvention, though full
rebrands can still be transformative when tied to business strategy. 

 IN DEFENCE OF ENSHITTIFICATION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers often resist changes that worsen user experience, but
sometimes these trade-offs are necessary for a product's survival. The
concept of “enshittification” describes platforms degrading for
profit, yet in some cases, restricting free features or nudging
upgrades isn't greed - it's about sustaining the business, supporting
paying customers, and ensuring the product's future. 

 THE DESTINATION FOR AI INTERFACES IS DO WHAT I MEAN (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AI interfaces are evolving toward "Do What I Mean" (DWIM) systems,
where users express intent rather than follow interface bureaucracy
like complex menu sequences. This approach, rooted in 1966 computing
philosophy, allows users to simply state desired outcomes (like
"remove clouds") instead of executing step-by-step procedures. Such
intent-based interfaces unlock greater expressiveness and capability
by eliminating cognitive ergonomic limits imposed by traditional
buttons, menus, and swipes.

 YOUR POOR WORK/LIFE BALANCE MIGHT BE MY FAULT (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tools meant to add flexibility can instead push people to work
off-hours, causing burnout and inequity. Designers can counter this by
avoiding manipulative patterns and supporting boundaries through
features like working-hours settings, time awareness, and flexible
notifications. 

 WHY CONTEXT MATTERS IN AI AND UX FOR TRUST AND RESILIENCE (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Context has become a critical factor for effective AI and user
experience interactions. Mismatched context leads to misunderstandings
and eroded trust. A holistic approach includes auditing communication
channels and leveraging AI's expanding context windows. Practical
strategies involve contextual research, ethical safeguards, and
integrating real-time data to create more resilient, user-centric
digital systems. 

 “YOUR” VS “MY” IN USER INTERFACES (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 User interface labels should use "your" when the system communicates
to users and "my" when users communicate to the system. Many
interfaces unnecessarily add possessive prefixes when simple labels
work better. The "my" approach creates awkward situations in emails,
help documentation, and support interactions.
