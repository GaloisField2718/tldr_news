FOR BUSINESS‚ÄîUNTIL IT'S NOT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The US Justice Department sued Adobe for violating the ROSCA act,
alleging deceptive sign-up and cancellation practices where the
"annual, paid monthly" subscription terms were obscured in fine print
and only clearly disclosed during cancellation attempts. The lawsuit
highlights Adobe's use of "dark patterns" to manipulate users into
costly, hard-to-cancel subscriptions and reflects the government's
growing interest in addressing deceptive design practices. 

 AI + DESIGN: NAVIGATING THE PROMISE AND PITFALLS OF AI (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Figma's AI report: Eighty-five percent of designers say AI has
enhanced their productivity, mainly through text and image generation
or as a thought partner, with a threefold increase in significant
workflow transformations reported. However, only a third are proud of
their launched AI products, though this rises to 82% among those for
whom AI is crucial to the product, indicating a need for teams to
focus on collaborative AI solutions for broader impact. 

 EMOTIONAL DESIGN: WHY IT MATTERS IN UX (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 More than usability, Emotional Design is about creating products that
people love. Don Norman's three levels of emotional processing,
visceral, behavioral, and reflective, guide this approach. Visceral
design evokes immediate and positive reactions, behavioral design
ensures intuitive use, and reflective design aligns with personal
identity. Understanding these can help designers craft experiences
that resonate deeply with users, fostering lasting connections.
