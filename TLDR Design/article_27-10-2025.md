 OPENAI BUYS AI STARTUP THAT BUILT INTERFACE FOR APPLE COMPUTERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI acquired Software Applications Incorporated, the startup that
created Sky, an AI interface that lets Mac users interact with their
computers through natural language for tasks like writing, coding, and
planning. The 12-member team will join OpenAI. Financial terms have
not been disclosed. This marks OpenAI's latest acquisition following
previous purchases of Statsig for $1.1 billion and Jony Ive's io for

 ADOBE'S PROJECT INDIGO CAMERA FINALLY ADDS IPHONE 17 SUPPORT (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe's Project Indigo app has finally added support for the iPhone
17 series after weeks of incompatibility due to the phones' new
square-format front-facing camera sensor. To speed up release, Adobe
temporarily disabled access to the selfie camera and is only
supporting rear-camera functionality for now. A full fix, including
front-camera support, is expected soon.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ELIZABETH GOODSPEED ON WHY DESIGN STUDIOS ARE MAKING FONTS (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Brand designers are increasingly making their own typefaces to gain
creative control, ensure distinctiveness, and avoid expensive
licensing fees. With tools like Glyphs making font creation more
accessible, studios such as Koto, &Walsh, and Order are integrating
type design directly into branding work. However, this surge has also
led to many underdeveloped or derivative fonts, as tight timelines and
limited mentorship reduce craftsmanship. While the trend democratizes
access and encourages diversity in type design, it also threatens the
sustainability of the professional type industry. 

 WHAT TREND DO YOU WISH WOULD DIE? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Speakers shared design trends they'd like to see go at Frontify's
Paradigms conference. James Greenfield criticized brands chasing viral
social content over real experience, Bianca Berning debunked Comic
Sans as a universal dyslexic-friendly font, Nkenna Amadi warned
against blindly copying neon trends, Asmah Mansur-Williams advocated
for more expressive typefaces, and Jonas Hegi suggested studying
disliked trends for inspiration. 

 AI IN UX: ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI should be treated like an enthusiastic intern with no real-world
experience, requiring clear instructions, constant supervision, and
thorough verification of outputs. Real client projects demonstrate
AI's practical applications across user research, design, development,
and content creation, including online research, interview analysis,
prototyping, and copywriting. While AI increases productivity by 25-33
percent, it cannot replace human creativity, strategic thinking, or
understanding of user experience fundamentals.

 DESIGNING THE JARVIS MOMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's vision for ChatGPT resembles Tony Stark's JARVIS — a
conversational interface where users complete tasks without switching
apps. Evolving from plugins to the new Apps SDK, ChatGPT now embeds
interactive tools directly in chat through cards, buttons, and
widgets. For designers, this means crafting simple, intuitive,
context-aware interactions rather than screens, focusing on clarity,
minimal steps, and seamless integration across apps. 

 ERROR HANDLING - UX DESIGN PATTERNS (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Error handling is a crucial but often overlooked part of UX that can
either erode or build user trust. Good design treats errors as
opportunities for empathy, guiding users clearly on what went wrong,
why, and how to fix it. By distinguishing between slips (right
intention, wrong action) and mistakes (wrong intention), designers can
create forgiving, informative interfaces that prevent frustration.
Errors should appear in context, near their source, and never block
progress. Whether they stem from the user, environment, or system, the
goal is always calm, supportive recovery that keeps users confident
and in control.
