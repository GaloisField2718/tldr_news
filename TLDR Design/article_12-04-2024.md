NEWS & TRENDS

MINUTE READ) [3] 

 The latest UI redesign of YouTube's video player, which shifts video
details to a narrow right-aligned column, has been criticized by users
who find it congested and detracting from community engagement.
Despite YouTube's claim that the change aims to facilitate reading
comments while watching, the adverse reaction may prompt a
reconsideration of the design.

 WE MISUSE THE TERM "USER INSIGHT" A LOT ‚Äî HERE'S HOW TO ACTUALLY
USE IT (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 User insights, derived from data and behavior, provide actionable
guidance for teams, prioritized by urgency to tackle critical issues
first. Ensure insights meet value, relevance, specificity, and

project goals to communicate the stakes and drive decision-making. 

 ‚ÄúAI‚Äù WON'T SOLVE ACCESSIBILITY (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The notion that "AI" will negate the importance of accessibility is
wrong. Instead, addressing accessibility demands human-centric
solutions tailored to real-world scenarios. While current technology
offers tools to foster accessibility, adhering to established
guidelines can effectively address user needs without significant
alteration. 

 CHOOSING THE PERFECT ICONS FOR YOUR TYPEFACE (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Choosing suitable typefaces and icons can improve brand recognition,
enhance the overall user experience, and maintain visual consistency
in a project. Pair icons with a typeface after considering the
project's audience, message, and overall tone, as well as its visual
style and context. Typeface and icon are so interdependent that
sometimes it's worth creating an icon set from scratch based on the
typeface.
