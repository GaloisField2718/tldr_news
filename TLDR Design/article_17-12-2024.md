OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 "DESIGN LIKE APPLE" (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 To "design like Apple," prioritize simplicity through disciplined,
collaborative decision-making between designers and product managers
and empower design leaders to say "no" to unnecessary complexity.
Success requires a culture that values thoughtful design, respects its
role in product development, and emphasizes customer, product, and
business understanding over stylistic mimicry. 

 DESIGNING WITH LLMS IN THE TOOLBOX: 6 MONTHS LATER (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI models can streamline workflows, automate tasks, and generate
fresh ideas, from alternative concepts to clickable prototypes or
documentation drafts. However, they should be treated as a junior
coworker - useful but fallible - requiring critical oversight to
address biases and limitations. 

 EXPERIENCE DESIGN: THE NEXT ITERATION OF UX? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 XD (Experience Design) is an umbrella term encompassing UX, CX, and
related fields. It emphasizes human-centered problem-solving and
seamless experiences. Blurring roles, AI advancements, and
misconceptions about UX have driven the term's resurgence. While UX

 APPLE'S AI CHIEF DOESN'T WANT ADVANCED AI AKA AGI, BUT TO IMPROVE AI
IN PRODUCTS AND UX (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 John Giannandrea, Apple's senior VP of machine learning and AI
strategy, dismissed artificial general intelligence (AGI) as
unrealistic, favoring AI advancements focused on enhancing user
products. He criticized scaling existing AI for AGI as naïve,
emphasizing Apple's cautious, product-centered approach. With
significant research investment, Apple prioritizes practicality over
AGI, contrasting with competitors' ambitions and reshaping the AGI
development debate. 

 PRESERVING THE PIXEL ART LOOK IN WEB CONTENT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 To achieve a crisp pixel art style on modern websites, use CSS
techniques like image rendering, a pixelated property for images, and
embed pixel fonts with anti-aliasing disabled. Maintain proper pixel
alignment, optimize font sizes, and ensure compatibility using WOFF
file formats. These practices effectively preserve pixel art's sharp,
retro aesthetic. 

 THE IMPORTANCE OF GRACEFUL DEGRADATION IN ACCESSIBLE INTERFACE DESIGN
(8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Graceful degradation ensures essential website functions remain
operational despite partial failures. It minimizes single points of
failure and maintains accessibility through redundancy, load
balancing, and outdated browser support. Compared to progressive
enhancement, graceful degradation adapts to unforeseen issues
post-launch. Combining both strategies enhances resilience,
accessibility, and user experience, ensuring functionality across
varying devices and browsers.
