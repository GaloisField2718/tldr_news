 APPLE'S INTRO SPECIFICALLY PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE JOBS+JONY IVE ERA OF
DESIGN (AND IGNORES THE VISION PRO) (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's September event opened with an unusual 90-second tribute to
the Jobs and Jony Ive design era that showcased iconic design elements
across Apple's product lineup. The homage notably excluded meaningful
coverage of the Vision Pro, showing only a brief one-second shot of
its crown despite the headset representing a significant design
investment. The tribute also unusually highlighted Apple Store
architecture worldwide, suggesting the company wanted to celebrate its
design legacy spanning both products and retail spaces.

creative tools at no additional cost.

 HOW TO BUILD A RESILIENT DESIGN TEAM (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma design manager Jonas Downey outlines seven strategies for
building resilient design teams that can adapt to rapid technological
changes and high-pressure environments. Key approaches include
prioritizing team health through open communication and realistic
workloads, encouraging experimentation across traditional role
boundaries, and treating craft as a competitive differentiator. Downey
emphasizes building cross-functional bridges, implementing just enough
process to avoid stifling creativity, scaling teams intentionally
rather than filling headcount, and incorporating levity to maintain
team morale during challenging periods. 

 DESIGN X AI: PROVING WHAT'S POSSIBLE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A working AI-powered proof of concept was created in one hour using
Cursor and Figma MCP after stakeholders doubted the technical
feasibility of a brand expression feature idea. The prototype
automatically extracts brand colors from any website, converts
low-quality logos into crisp SVG vectors, and previews different color
combinations for brands. It shows how modern design leaders must be
hands-on with AI tools and technical building to lead teams and
collaborate with engineering effectively. 

 “TAKE YOUR PLEASURE SERIOUSLY”: WHY JOY SUSTAINS SERIOUS WORK (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design can ease workplace mental strain not just by function, but by
perception and delight. Research like the Hitachi ATM study
(aesthetic–usability effect) and NASA's Task Load Index show that
attractive, simplified designs reduce cognitive load, while examples
from Asana, Slack, and the Eames Office illustrate how small sparks of
joy and playfulness make tools feel more human and manageable.

 THE FIRST 30 SECONDS: HOW TO SHOW VALUE IN AI PRODUCT ONBOARDING (14
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI product onboarding should prioritize personalization and immediate
value delivery over traditional feature walkthroughs, with 80-90% of
trials occurring on Day 0, making those first moments critical.
Effective flows start with simple questions, build context-aware
personalization that adapts to user input, and reward effort with
tangible results rather than promises. The strongest approach enables
users to create real value during onboarding, transforming the
experience from passive demonstration into active participation that
builds momentum toward conversion. 

 UNSTRUCTURED INPUT IN AI APPS INSTEAD OF WEB FORMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 AI applications can now replace traditional web forms by allowing
users to submit information in any format—images, PDFs, audio, or
text—while AI models handle the conversion to structured database
entries. This approach utilizes systems like AgentDB's templating,
allowing users to say "add this" and upload unstructured content, such
as Instagram screenshots, for a concert tracker. The AI extracts
required information (show, date, venue, etc.) and formats it properly
for the database, eliminating the need for people to adapt their input
to rigid form fields. 

 DOWNLOAD THE NEW IPHONE AIR AND IPHONE 17 PRO WALLPAPERS (1 MINUTE

 Apple's new iPhone wallpapers are now available, with designs for the
iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro. The Air wallpaper references the camera
plateau, while the Pro wallpaper spells out “PRO” vertically. Both
can dynamically color-match the device or case.
