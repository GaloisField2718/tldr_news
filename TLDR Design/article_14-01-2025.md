 THE RISE OF THE GENERALIST (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generalists are becoming increasingly valuable in the design industry
due to their ability to adapt to different roles and collaborate
across various disciplines. With the industry moving away from strict
specialization, generalists are crucial in bridging team gaps and
driving innovation by integrating knowledge from multiple fields.
Success in this evolving landscape requires designers to cultivate a
mindset of continuous learning and curiosity.

by adding a tab for non-visual data, showing the potential to enhance
accessibility and collaboration with developers.
