 REIMAGINING FLUID TYPOGRAPHY (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Fluid typography should respect user preferences without relying on
fixed assumptions. Using em and rem maintains internal harmony, but

often differ, making pixel-based conversions unreliable. The best
approach is to avoid setting a root font size, allowing user-defined
preferences to control text scaling naturally.
