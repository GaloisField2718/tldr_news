MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's Machine Learning team built Matrix3D, a photogrammetry model
that makes detailed 3D reconstructions from only three 2D images using
a unified process. It uses masked learning like early Transformer AI,
training effectively on smaller datasets. Aimed at devices like Apple
Vision Pro, Matrix3D is open source on GitHub with sample videos and
point cloud demos online.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY I SKIPPED FIGMA AND PROTOTYPED IN CODE INSTEAD (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Vibe coding helps designers prototype data visualizations with Apache
ECharts instead of static Figma mockups. ChatGPT offers a safe sandbox
to generate and test code, improving clarity and communication with
engineers. It reduces friction in designing interactive elements and
best expresses design intent within defined systems, not full
production. 

 WHY I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT MY UX JOB IN THE ERA OF AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI is a tool in evolving UX, not a threat to UX careers. Like past
shifts with automated testing and remote research, UX still focuses on
building better products. Some methods may be automated, but human
skills like problem definition, questioning, evaluation, and
understanding behavior stay essential as AI-driven research methods
grow. 

 HEY, AT LEAST HBO MAX CAN LAUGH AT ITSELF (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Warner Bros. Discovery is reversing its 2023 decision by rebranding
Max back to HBO Max, embracing both the legacy and cultural weight of
the HBO name. The move, paired with a self-aware and humorous social
media campaign, highlights the power of acknowledging missteps and
reconnecting with audiences through authenticity and cultural
relevance. 

 “IT WAS A BIT NUTS” – TEO CONNOR ON DESIGNING THE NEW AIRBNB
APP (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Airbnb has launched a major redesign of its app to expand beyond
accommodations into services and experiences, with VP of Design Teo
Connor leading the 18-month project to integrate a wealth of new
offerings while maintaining a simple, beautiful user experience. When
reflecting on her journey from a London design studio to Silicon
Valley, Connor emphasized the importance of courage, craft, and
curiosity in building scalable design systems that align with both
user needs and business goals. 

 CAREER ADVICE IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Many senior tech professionals are finding today's job market and
workplace dynamics significantly less rewarding, as the rise of AI,
changing evaluation criteria, and tighter funding have devalued
once-critical leadership and team-building skills. The transition to
foundational models like LLMs is reshaping both product and software
development, creating a high-stakes environment where staying engaged
and adaptable is essential to remain relevant and employed.

 YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH AUDIO-TECHNICA'S NEW TRANSPARENT TURNTABLE
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Audio-Technica's AT-LPA2 is a transparent turntable with a 30mm
acrylic base and 20mm platter for visual impact and vibration control.
Its minimalist design separates the power supply and controls into an
external unit to keep the chassis clean and uncluttered. A redesigned
carbon fiber tone arm complements the sleek, futuristic aesthetic. 

 THE TRUE PATH TO GARBAGE CODE: FIGMA SITES (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Figma Sites (beta) generates poorly structured code with significant
accessibility issues. One navigation link shows divs misused as links,
keyboard failures, duplicated text for screen readers, ignored motion
settings, and unannounced new tab links. The site also has
inconsistent headings, random landmarks, missing image alt text, text
overflow at large fonts, and wrong language tags. A good
design-to-code tool should avoid such basic mistakes. 

 INTEGRATING LOCALIZATION INTO DESIGN SYSTEMS (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Localization in a Figma design system requires restructuring tokens
for themes, density, and grouped languages. Challenges include
typography limits, CSS line-height mismatches, font issues, and ghost
variables. The solution is to use JSON files, manual typography
tweaks, and a cheat sheet to guide designers on text expansion, RTL
layouts, and cultural needs. 

 FROM HOMES TO HAIRCUTS: AIRBNB'S NEW APP IS DESIGNED TO DO IT ALL (1
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Airbnb has evolved from a home-booking platform into a comprehensive
travel companion that offers services like manicures and personal
training alongside experiences such as food tours, all integrated into
a redesigned app. The in-house design team aimed to preserve the
brand's essence while enhancing usability, introducing a softer, more
intuitive interface and new features like a dynamic “Trips” tab
and guest-to-guest communication to reflect modern travel needs. 

 TAXI STUDIO BALANCES TRUST AND PLAY IN YOLOH REBRAND (4 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Taxi Studio rebranded the insurance start-up Yoloh with a playful yet
credible visual and verbal identity centered on the idea of
“dejumbling insurance,” leading to a tenfold increase in valuation
and successful seed funding. The rebrand introduced distinctive
elements like the ambigram logo, a human-like hand mascot named Andi,
and a warm, accessible tone, helping Yoloh stand out in a
traditionally conservative industry and appeal to a broad,
multi-generational audience.

 MINIMALIST VS. MAXIMALIST POSTERS: WHICH DESIGN STYLE WORKS BEST? (6
MINUTE READ) [20]

and excitement. 

 OUR PLEDGE TO HELP IMPROVE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
