 CARS WILL NEED FEWER SCREENS AND MORE BUTTONS TO EARN 5-STAR SAFETY
RATING IN EUROPE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In 2026, the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) will require
physical controls in cars for them to earn a five-star rating. The
maximum safety rating will only be given to vehicles with physical
buttons, dials, or stalks for hazard warning lights, indicators,
windscreen wipers, SOS calls, and horns. Despite increasing
complaints, manufacturers like Tesla and Volkswagen keep pushing
touch-sensitive interfaces for basic vehicle controls, mainly because
they're more cost-efficient.

reminders, assists with calls, makes online purchases, and helps with
other tasks.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ON NIELSEN'S IDEAS ABOUT GENERATIVE UI FOR RESOLVING ACCESSIBILITY (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Jakob Nielsen thinks that accessibility is too expensive and claims
that the accessibility movement has been a miserable failure. His
ideas are causing further harm: he‚Äôs telling companies they‚Äôre
right not to invest in accessibility, failing to mention that a lack
of training or understanding of digital accessibility contributes to
perceived failure. 

 BEST PRACTICES FOR INCLUSIVE DESIGN ‚Äì PART 2 (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Inclusive design makes digital content accessible and usable by as
many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or
disabilities. Designers should keep layouts simple to help screen
readers read in the correct order, use built-in heading styles and
plain language, include captions for videos, provide descriptions for
images, and support text resizing up to 200%. 

 DESIGN SYSTEM GENERATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Design systems are stable and sufficient core libraries of assets,
docs, tools, and practices for designers and developers. A system and
its adopters may live with it for years, so everyone must understand
what it is, why it was made, and the scale of the effort and reward
that went into each generation of the system.

 WEB TECH TRENDS TO WATCH IN 2024 AND BEYOND (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dark mode has evolved into an essential aspect of web design. AI
empowers designers to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of
design. AR has the potential to increase user engagement and
conversion rates dramatically. Minimalism and maximalism capture
users‚Äô attention in different ways, and both are here to stay. 

 DESIGN ENGINEERING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Design Engineers are naturals at design infrastructure ‚Äî the
underlying tools and systems that scale design. We are navigating what
seems to be a tech paradigm shift with LLMs, AI applications, and
multi-device experiences. Design Engineers will be this decade‚Äôs
Data Scientists. 

 F. C. VARIABLE: ROB EN ROBIN CREATE CUSTOMISABLE ILLUSTRATIONS
INSPIRED BY VARIABLE FONTS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In F.C. Variable, Rob en Robin combined illustration and variable
fonts to allow users to tweak the shape and size of a goalpost via

 SLIDERS DEGRADE UX (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The reason sliders are bad UX isn't just that your finger covers up
the values. Controlling them is hard - their values can't be clearly
labeled, they're hard to squeeze on small screens, and they have an
upper limit.

 ‚ÄúAI‚Äù AND ACCESSIBLE FRONT-END COMPONENTS: IS THE NUANCE
GENERATABLE? (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Relying solely on generative AI for accessible front-end design is
impractical and undesirable due to AI's lack of human nuance,
potential for incorrect or inaccessible code, false authority, and
hindrance to innovation in accessible design.
