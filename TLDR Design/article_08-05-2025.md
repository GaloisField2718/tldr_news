NEWS & TRENDS

 CRINGEWORTHY GOOGLE AD MOCKS THE IPHONE 17 DESIGN EVEN BEFORE IT
LAUNCHES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google has released a new ad for its upcoming Pixel 9 Pro that mocks
the unannounced iPhone 17 for allegedly copying Pixel's design and
features. The ad, styled as a satirical podcast between animated
phones, highlights how Apple has historically introduced features like
Night Mode, photo clean-up, and widgets years after Google. Critics
have called the ad “cringeworthy” and heavy-handed, arguing that
its overt jabs lack subtlety and rely on dated competitive tropes. 

 PINTEREST USERS LEFT CONFUSED BY MASS ACCOUNT SUSPENSIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Pinterest is facing backlash after numerous users reported sudden
account suspensions and pin removals without clear violations. Posts
across social media platforms, including Reddit, describe innocent
content being flagged as “adult,” leading to widespread confusion.
While Pinterest allows appeals and cites guideline enforcement, it has
yet to address growing speculation about faulty AI moderation. 

 OMNI REFERENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Midjourney's version 7 introduced the Omni Reference feature,
allowing users to insert specific people, objects, or creatures from
one reference image into AI-generated scenes. Combined with text
prompts, style references, and the weight parameter (--ow), typically
kept under 400 for optimal results, it offers significantly more
creative control. However, the feature does not support inpainting,
Fast Mode, zoom, or pan, and requires additional GPU power.

 WHAT I LEARNED WORKING AT FIGMA: PRIORITISING CRAFT (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Figma built a culture that values craft, blending low ego with high
care to foster honest feedback, early cross-functional collaboration,
and regular team critique sessions. It prioritizes quality over strict
deadlines, often delaying launches to refine details while staying in
close touch with users. To build similar environments: open critiques
to all roles, hire for humility and teamwork, and challenge timelines
if quality falls short. 

 SHOW IMPACT AND DON'T BADMOUTH YOUR OLD JOB – ADVICE FROM DESIGN
RECRUITERS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design recruiters say the job market is tough, with high competition
and few roles, though it's not due to a lack of talent. To stand out,
designers should show the business impact of their work, tailor
applications, stay positive, and focus on strong portfolios over
personal branding. 

 UX LOCALIZATION: ADAPTING USER INTERFACES FOR DIVERSE CULTURES (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX localization means more than just translation - it adapts
interfaces for different cultures by managing text length, reading
direction, colors, and symbols. While maintaining global brand
consistency, designers must also address local needs by using flexible
layouts and defining guidelines for what elements can be adapted.
Important areas to focus on include fonts, icons, content layout, and
clear, culturally neutral writing.

 AI CAN'T REPLACE DESIGNERS. BUT IT CAN BE A POWERFUL IDEATION TOOL (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI won't replace designers, but those who ignore it will fall behind.
As a rapid ideation tool, AI can generate concepts in seconds,
replacing time spent browsing, organizing, or searching for
inspiration. When paired with human creativity, it becomes a powerful
collaborator that enhances, rather than replaces, the design process.
