 INI ARCHIBONG DESIGNS PACKAGING FOR SNOOP DOGG AND DR DRE'S GIN &
JUICE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The packaging for Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre's premixed drink brand,
designed by designer Ini Archibong, embodies the spirit of 1990s West
Coast hip hop. The design includes a hand-drawn lowrider by Los
Angeles illustrator Wayne Johnson, who rendered the low-slung car in
different colors to represent various drink flavors. Central to the
can is a parental advisory logo, which captures the era's cultural
impact. The minimal white can juxtapose the vibrant lowrider,
reflecting the influence and aesthetic of Dr. Dre's music and album
art.

metrics when viewing the original post. The change could significantly
impact the "ratio" culture, where replies to unpopular posts often
outperform the original in terms of likes and reposts.
