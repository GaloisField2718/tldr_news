NEWS & TRENDS

 DISNEY SUES AI IMAGE GENERATOR MIDJOURNEY (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Disney, Universal, and other major studios filed the first Hollywood
lawsuit against AI image generator Midjourney for repeatedly producing
their copyrighted characters without permission. The suit focuses on
character copyright violations, with evidence showing Midjourney
generating recognizable characters like Spider-Man even from generic
prompts like "superhero fight scene." Disney is likely aiming to
secure a licensing deal rather than shut down the profitable AI
company, which operates uniquely without venture capital funding. 

 ADOBE POSTS SOLID EARNINGS BEAT AND RAISES ITS FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE,
BUT INVESTORS YAWN (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe beat Q2 earnings expectations with $5.06 per share on $5.87
billion revenue and raised full-year guidance, but investors remained
unimpressed as the stock declined. The company faces mounting pressure
from AI competition despite launching its own generative AI tools like
Firefly, with analysts concerned that traditional creative software
could become less relevant. Adobe's stock has fallen 7% year-to-date
as investors question whether the company can successfully monetize AI
tools amid increasing competition from rivals like Canva and OpenAI. 

 EVEN MICROSOFT IS MOCKING APPLE'S LIQUID GLASS UI DESIGN (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple's new Liquid Glass UI drew praise for being “delightful,”
“elegant,” and “modern,” but also sparked debate over its
similarity to older designs like Windows Vista's Aero Glass. Microsoft
playfully accused Apple of copying Vista in a viral TikTok video,
though many argue Apple's implementation is more advanced, reigniting
the age-old debate over who did translucent UI best—and who did it
first.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE ART SECRET BEHIND ALL GREAT DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Visual composition serves as a basic language that communicates
meaning even before we get to the actual content. We tend to "read" a
composition intuitively, much like we process grammar in writing,
which is why a well-designed layout feels satisfying even before we
engage with the text. That's why it's a good idea to spend extra time
on wireframing during the design process. If a layout works well with
placeholder elements, it will end up supporting whatever final content
you add later. 

 HOW TO NAME THINGS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Naming in design and development significantly impacts team
communication and thinking. Poor choices create confusion between
designers, developers, and product managers using different
"dialects." Effective naming requires balancing specificity with
flexibility. Teams should actively address naming inconsistencies to
reduce frustration and improve collaboration. 

 HOW JAM JARS EXPLAIN APPLE'S SUCCESS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Paradox of Choice suggests that offering too many options can
overwhelm consumers, reducing both satisfaction and the likelihood of
a purchase. While the theory has been debated, its core insight holds:
people prefer fewer, well-curated, clearly framed choices that
simplify decision-making and reduce regret.

 HOW AI CONVERTS PROTOTYPES TO CODE (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI tools are revolutionizing prototype-to-code conversion by
analyzing design files and generating clean, maintainable code that
maintains consistency between design and development. These tools
enable developers to work 55% faster while reducing development costs
by 20-30%. They also enable designers to gain creative freedom and
businesses to achieve faster time-to-market. 

 THE POWER OF DESIGNING FOR PUSHBACK (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI systems like ChatGPT are designed to be overly accommodating,
which may diminish users' critical thinking abilities, prompting the
need for "productive resistance" that challenges rather than validates
user input. Well-designed AI pushback can stimulate deeper learning
and better decision-making, particularly in educational contexts and
misinformation correction, where challenging misconceptions prove more
effective than passive compliance. Designers face the crucial task of
balancing trust-building with critical engagement, creating AI
interfaces that encourage intentional thinking rather than addictive
validation-seeking behaviors. 

 ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO KNOW IF A JOB IS RIGHT FOR YOU OR NOT (8
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 First impressions of a job are often accurate, and when something
feels off early on, it usually doesn't improve with time. This is
especially true for managers, whose roles demand deep alignment with
company values, making it crucial to recognize misalignment early and
learn from the experience to avoid similar pitfalls in the future.
