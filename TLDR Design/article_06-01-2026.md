NEWS & TRENDS

 OPENAI MAY BUY PINTEREST — AND IT COULD CHANGE HOW WE SEARCH, SHOP,
AND SCROLL (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI is rumored to be exploring a potential acquisition of
Pinterest, though neither company has commented publicly. The move
would give OpenAI access to Pinterest's vast, intent-labeled visual
dataset, along with its established shopping and ad infrastructure,
potentially pushing ChatGPT toward more visual, commerce-driven
discovery. While still speculative, the report signals OpenAI's
growing interest in owning distribution and competing more directly
with Google, Meta, and Amazon beyond chat alone. 

 SAMSUNG TAPS BOUROULLEC TO DESIGN SPEAKERS THAT BLEND INTO ROOMS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Samsung unveiled Music Studio 7 and Music Studio 5 Wi-Fi speakers at
CES 2026. Designed by Erwan Bouroullec with a dot motif to blend into
living spaces as furniture rather than gadgets, the Music Studio 7
features 3.1.1-channel spatial audio, and the compact Music Studio 5
uses a 4-inch woofer with dual tweeters. Both offer hi-res playback up
to 24-bit/96 kHz, AI Dynamic Bass Control, and Q-Symphony multi-device
sound integration with Samsung TVs. The speakers support Wi-Fi
casting, Spotify Tap, voice control, and Samsung's Seamless Codec for
Bluetooth connectivity across rooms. 

 MICROSOFT IS SLOWLY TURNING EDGE INTO ANOTHER COPILOT APP — TESTS
REDESIGNED UI THAT TAKES INSPIRATION FROM COPILOT (10 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Microsoft Edge is testing a major UI refresh in Canary and Dev builds
that adopts the rounded shapes, colors, fonts, and overall design
language of Microsoft's Copilot app, affecting menus, settings, and
the new tab page regardless of Copilot Mode (with minor exceptions).
This shift suggests Microsoft may be moving beyond its long-standing
Fluent Design toward a Copilot-led visual system, though for now it
creates a noticeable design split between Edge, Copilot, and platforms
like Windows 11, Office, and Xbox.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 A UX WAKE-UP CALL — DESIGNING FOR PEOPLE VS. DESIGNING FOR
INVESTORS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tech products now prioritize investor metrics over user needs, with
companies deliberately degrading experiences to maximize short-term
revenue in a process called "enshittification." This strategy treats
users as raw material for monetization rather than people to serve,
particularly evident in AI products built on hype rather than genuine
utility. Designers and product leaders must reject this approach by
insisting on human-centered metrics that rebuild trust instead of
sacrificing user experience for growth narratives. 

 WHY AM I STILL EXPLAINING MY JOB IN 2026? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX writing is often misunderstood because it works best when it's
invisible. It is wrongly seen as “soft” compared to design and
engineering, and has been diluted by unclear roles and late
involvement—yet it fundamentally shapes trust, decisions, and
behaviour. UX writers design understanding through judgment and
strategy, and to be taken seriously, must position their work around
measurable outcomes, get involved earlier, and prove impact rather
than merely explaining their role. 

 10 UX DESIGN SHIFTS YOU CAN'T IGNORE IN 2026 (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX in 2026 will be defined by AI-driven experiences that are
explainable, agent-based, dynamic, and increasingly multimodal, with
micro-interactions, voice, AR, and biometrics becoming everyday
infrastructure rather than novelties. Across devices and contexts, the
emphasis shifts to trust, accessibility, and respectful
personalization—designing systems that genuinely help users without
intruding on their privacy or attention.

 TRUTH AND CERTAINTY (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Faith operates as an ongoing willingness to live with unanswered
questions, while certainty breeds predictable loyalists rather than
reflective individuals who do inward work. Systems elevate faith to
abstraction while requiring certainty at ground level, resulting in
people who repeat truths they never discovered themselves, replacing
authentic self-formation. 

 THE TOP 10 ART TRENDS IN 2026 (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Art trends in 2026 mark a decisive shift from algorithm-driven
perfection toward handcrafted works with visible labor, tactile
surfaces, and intentional imperfections. The ten major trends include
immersive-scale installations, craft revival with mixed media, naive
painting, new surrealism with personal mythology, 2D/3D workflow
fusion, and direct-to-collector markets bypassing galleries.
Collectors prioritize authenticity and emotional connection over
technical perfection, with younger buyers driving demand for
affordable originals under $2,000 through direct artist relationships.

marque's 1970s heritage through a blocky, retro typeface, prioritising
