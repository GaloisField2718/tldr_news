 TIKTOK‚ÄôS NATIVE APP ARRIVES FOR THE VISION PRO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The interface for TikTok's native app in the Vision Pro will look
familiar to anyone who has used TikTok‚Äôs apps, with a vertically
oriented player for videos and buttons to like, comment, favorite, and
share. TikTok has taken advantage of the increased screen real estate
offered by the Vision Pro to spread out other interface elements.
Comments and creator profiles are displayed on a pane to the right so
they don‚Äôt obscure the primary video player. 

 ADOBE PATENT TACKLES BIAS IN IMAGE AI TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An Adobe patent application seeks to balance output from generative
image models for "image-to-image translation tasks" to create images
with "minority attributes" properly. The design titan wants to correct
the bias in generated images by oversampling images with specific
minority characteristics in image datasets. These attributes can
include many physical characteristics, including hair types, colors,
baldness, and accessories.

 THE BIG DESIGN FREAK-OUT: A GENERATION OF DESIGN LEADERS GRAPPLE WITH
THEIR FUTURE (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Major tech companies that were once considered leaders in design are
downsizing design executives' positions due to a correction in the
expectations of seasoned design leaders and a pause in hiring.
Salaries for these design leaders have dropped 15% to 20% from their
height two years ago when salaries were notoriously high, as companies
now want more from workers while paying less for it. 

 AUTOMATING ABLEISM (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are some excellent outcomes from AI for the disability
community, but the future looks bleak overall. In the health care
system, algorithmic tools and AI have been working against disabled
people due to the nature of their treatment. The technology community
must embrace disabled people from the start, including them as
designers and in other product roles, so they can contribute to
shaping the technologies that mediate the world around them. 

 THE REALITY OF UX WRITING AND CONTENT DESIGN LAYOFFS (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A growing number of UX tasks are being replaced by AI tools, putting
the role of human UX professionals at risk. While it might make
economic sense to have lean teams equipped with AI, doing so raises
questions about the creativity, empathy, and nuanced understanding
that humans bring. On the other hand, there's compelling evidence that
UX writing and content design is still a promising field.

 HOW CAN DESIGNERS CHARGE MORE FOR THEIR WORK? WE ASK PRALINE‚ÄôS
DAVID TANGUY AND YARZA TWINS (7 MINUTE READ) [15]
