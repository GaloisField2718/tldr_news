 UX DESIGNERS‚Äô BURNOUT: HOW TO DEAL WITH IT? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers burn out because of three reasons: constant pressure and
deadlines, being an underestimated member of a team, and monotonous
work. As a result, the quality of their work decreases, their
motivation disappears, and their well-being deteriorates due to stress
and overwork. To prevent burnout, they should take walks, keep track
of their schedule, not don‚Äôt overwork themselves, leave enough time
for hobbies and socializing, get rid of distractions at work, exercise
to stay fit and dump the extra stress, and check in with their career
progress regularly. 

 DEFAULT IT OR DESIGN IT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In design, problems arise when designers spend too much time on
minutia at the expense of big strategic decisions. The ‚ÄúDefault it
or Design it‚Äù heuristic helps mitigate that issue by sorting
decisions based on their impact, allowing designers to focus their
creativity where it matters most. The 'Default It' approach is about
simplifying choices. On the other side is the 'Design It' approach,
where designers take time to work in-depth on critical choices that
can shape projects in big ways. 

 ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS TO STAKEHOLDERS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A design decision is often viewed as a matter of personal preference
or opinion. However, design solves problems, so it is essential to
base decisions on something other than hunches or ideas. Throughout
this lesson, you'll learn how to align stakeholders' expectations and
gain their support for your design choices through effective
communication. You'll find flaws and wrong assumptions so your work
supports users while matching business goals. Also, you'll learn how
to explain how your decisions impact business goals.

 EMBRACING INDIVIDUALITY IN DESIGN ‚Äì HERE‚ÄôS THE STORY OF FERR√âOL
BABIN (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Within the furniture and lighting design realm, there‚Äôs an unspoken
rule regarding design pitches. Designers share their concepts with
companies, and it‚Äôs the company‚Äôs prerogative whether to proceed
with the idea. Ferr√©ol Babin made a bold decision at a certain
point‚Äîto start afresh and create his pieces with a distinctive
approach that birthed something entirely new, unparalleled, and
inspirational, breathing life into beautiful objects crafted with
reverence for both material and process‚Äîan ethos that every designer
should embrace. 

 PASSKEYS: A NO-FRILLS EXPLAINER ON THE FUTURE OF PASSWORD-LESS
AUTHENTICATION (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Passkeys are beginning to make their way into popular apps, from
password managers to multi-factor authenticators, vastly improving the
user experience of authentication. There‚Äôs also a downside ‚Äî
having to store additional cryptographic keys for each login and every
site for which you have a passkey often requires more space than
storing a password. However, the security gains, the user experience
from not having to remember a password, and the prevention of common
phishing techniques more than offset the increased storage space.

 AI DOESN‚ÄôT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS YET: USER EXPERIENCE IS A BIG
MISSING PIECE (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 More than half of the world's population has low literacy, making
using prompts difficult. Alternatively, the fundamentals of usability

interested.
