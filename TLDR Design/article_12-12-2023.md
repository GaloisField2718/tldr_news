READ) [14]

value but asking questions to discover the problem the design is
trying to solve. It‚Äôs also about being kind ‚Äî criticism is a tool

garbage? Most designers are just workers, not unlike the office
assistants, support agents, and store clerks involved in getting
products to people. They can‚Äôt be blamed as a group but only as
individuals.
