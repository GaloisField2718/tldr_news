 CHARACTERAI REMOVES DISNEY CHARACTERS AFTER RECEIVING
CEASE-AND-DESIST LETTER (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Character.AI demanding the
removal of its copyrighted characters from the chatbot platform,
citing trademark infringement and concerns about sexually exploitative
content that could harm children and damage Disney's reputation. The
AI chatbot service, which enables users to create digital companions
based on real people and fictional characters, has removed major
Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse and Captain America, from its
search results. However, some Disney-owned properties, such as Percy
Jackson and Hannah Montana, remain accessible on the platform. 

 MICROSOFT'S NEW OFFICE ICONS ARE MORE CURVY AND COLORFUL (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Microsoft is unveiling redesigned Office icons with a more colorful,
gradient-heavy aesthetic featuring softer curves and enhanced
contrast, marking the first major update since 2018. The refresh
affects all 10 core Office apps, with design choices inspired by the
Copilot icon to reflect a more connected Microsoft 365 ecosystem.
Changes include simplified elements like Word's horizontal bars,
reduced from four to three, while sharp edges give way to fluid forms
for improved legibility and accessibility. 

 APPLE VISION AIR REPORTEDLY SHELVED OVER META AI GLASSES COMPETITORS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has reportedly scrapped its cheaper, lighter Vision Pro model
to focus on developing smart glasses that can compete with Meta's
AI-powered eyewear. Bloomberg says Apple is prioritizing two models: a
display-less iPhone-paired version expected by 2027 and
display-enabled glasses now being fast-tracked for 2028. Both will
rely heavily on AI and voice interaction.

 CRAFT IN PRODUCT DESIGN: A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A five-part framework evaluates visual craft in product design:
technique (tool mastery), intentionality (thoughtful UI choices with
clear rationale), voice (brand expression), attention to detail
(polished execution), and visual communication (compelling
presentation skills). Craft has gained importance because AI tools and
design systems have commoditized basic competency, making exceptional
execution a key differentiator. Design leaders should assess craft
across these specific criteria, rather than generalizing, and match
evaluation to role requirements while supporting designer growth
toward well-rounded "product designer" capabilities in both UX and
visual design. 

 UX SPEAK: THE UNTOLD ORIGINS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many common UX buzzwords have surprisingly old and unusual origins.
“User experience” was coined in the 1990s, but “writer” once
meant to scratch or carve, “designer” originally implied a
schemer, and “researcher” has meant to investigate since the
1500s. Methods like “A/B testing” stem from testing metals in clay
pots, “brainstorming” once described delirium before being
popularized in the 1940s, “case study” emerged from early
20th-century law, and “agile” comes from the Latin for nimble,
later repurposed in software development in 2001. 

 TURN DRIFT INTO DIRECTION (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Leaving a toxic job after burnout teaches important lessons about
preparing an exit before reaching a breaking point. Key strategies
include knowing your financial “floor,” keeping your portfolio
updated, separating your identity from your job, treating exits as
bridges rather than dead ends, networking proactively, leaning on
trusted people for perspective, and regularly preparing with small
steps to leave without losing yourself or your career momentum.

 FIVE TRENDY ART STYLES DESIGNERS SHOULD EXPLORE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designers should explore five trending art styles to stay relevant in
the creative marketplace and connect with evolving consumer
preferences. Neo-Brutalism offers bold minimalism for
attention-grabbing web designs, while Textured Art provides warmth and
human connection through layered visuals. Gothic styles remain
timeless for luxury branding, Bold Minimalism delivers clean layouts
with strong contrast, and Pixelated graphics have resurged through
indie games and retro-themed campaigns as cost-effective,
beginner-friendly options. 

 CREATIVES FEAR THE WORST AS AFFINITY'S WEBSITE IS PAUSED (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Affinity has paused its website, purchases, and forums ahead of an
October 30 announcement, sparking speculation about major changes
following its 2024 Canva acquisition. While some expect the launch of
“Affinity 3” with AI tools, many designers fear a shift to
subscriptions or AI-focused models, with the vague messaging fueling
anxiety and distrust among longtime users. 

 RUSLAN ABASOV SAYS DESIGNING TYPEFACES IS LIKE “DANCING” WITH HIS
ARM (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ruslan Abasov, a Lausanne-based type designer with roots in Istanbul,
approaches typography as storytelling, drawing on his background in
both Cyrillic and Latin scripts. His experimental typefaces—like
“Mouris Display” created with a 90s computer mouse, “Daido
Display” inspired by photographer Daido Moriyama, and “Escargot
Display” blending Art Nouveau with machine-driven Bezier
forms—reflect his playful, narrative-driven process, which treats
type design much like filmmaking.

 ARE ACCESSIBILITY OVERLAYS A GOOD INVESTMENT? (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Accessibility overlays—JavaScript tools that sit atop websites
without modifying the underlying code—actually break assistive
technologies, create legal liability by demonstrating that businesses
were aware of accessibility issues but chose inadequate fixes, and
cost more than proper remediation when lawsuits and emergency repairs
are factored in. 

 THE DESIGN SYSTEM LIFECYCLE 2.0 (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Most design systems' lifecycle consists of six stages: Intelligence
(continuous research and insight gathering), Strategy (alignment with
vision), Execution (building and testing MVPs with AI acceleration),
Impact (proving ROI through adoption metrics), Evolution (automated
adaptation and platform expansion), and Metrics (connecting adoption
to business outcomes).

MINUTE READ) [18]
