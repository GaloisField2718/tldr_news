 FIGJAM DIAGRAMMING IN CLAUDE (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Claude now supports FigJam diagramming through the Figma connector,
allowing users to transform conversations, documents, and images into
visual diagrams, including flowcharts, state diagrams, Gantt charts,
and sequence diagrams. This feature helps break down complexity and
visualize processes, system states, project timelines, and workflows.
Generated diagrams can be opened in FigJam for refinement and team
collaboration. 

 INTRODUCING GOOGLE ADS FOR WEBFLOW: THE AI-DRIVEN WAY TO GROW SMARTER
AND FASTER (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Webflow has launched a Google Ads integration that allows marketing
teams to create, manage, and optimize ad campaigns directly within the
Webflow platform, eliminating the need to switch between tools. The
integration leverages Google AI and Performance Max to help teams
reach high-intent audiences across Search, YouTube, Display, and other
Google properties while maintaining seamless brand consistency from ad
to landing page. Early adopters, including Fried Egg Golf, You.com,
and Proctor + Stevenson, report faster campaign launches and better
alignment between advertising strategy and website experiences. 

 KOTO EVOLVES GOFUNDME'S BRAND AS PLATFORM EXPANDS BEYOND INDIVIDUAL
GIVING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Global creative studio Koto has partnered with GoFundMe on a brand
evolution that reflects its expansion from peer-to-peer fundraising
into a broader giving ecosystem, while preserving the platform's
emotional clarity and trust. Centered on the reimagined Progress
Circle and supported by refined logo details, expanded colour and type
systems, and updated imagery, motion, and voice, the new identity uses
a single, flexible idea to create coherence across products,
audiences, and experiences as GoFundMe continues to scale.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FRICTION BY DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Frictionless digital design optimizes for speed and efficiency, but
removing all obstacles can eliminate awareness and meaningful
decision-making. Deliberately designed friction—like confirmation
pauses or undo delays—create moments of attention that respect human
judgment rather than pushing machine-speed interactions. Good friction
is intentional and purposeful, while bad friction wastes time without
delivering value. 

 HOW TO FAVICON IN 2026: THREE FILES THAT FIT MOST NEEDS (14 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Modern websites need only three favicon files instead of the typical
20+ icons: a 32×32 ICO for legacy browsers, an SVG with light/dark
theme support for modern browsers, and a 180×180 PNG for Apple
devices. Progressive Web Apps require two additional PNG files
(192×192 and 512×512) referenced in a web manifest JSON file. This
minimalist approach relies on SVG scalability and browser downscaling
rather than multiple static files, eliminating outdated formats like
Windows Tile icons and Safari's pinned tab icons while maintaining
compatibility across all major browsers and devices. 

 PHOTOSHOP JUST FIXED SOME OF ITS MOST ANNOYING WORKFLOW PROBLEMS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Adobe's latest Adobe Photoshop update focuses on reducing everyday
friction for working creatives, introducing proper non-destructive,
maskable adjustment layers for Clarity, Dehaze, and Grain alongside
quieter but meaningful workflow improvements. Upgraded Firefly-powered
generative tools, more reliable reference image handling, and a new
Dynamic Text beta collectively make edits cleaner, more flexible, and
easier to trust in real production work without fundamentally changing
how Photoshop is used.

 ATOMIC DESIGN: FROM UI COMPOSITION TO REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Atomic Design effectively organizes UI components into atoms,
molecules, and organisms, but it should serve as a composition pattern
rather than a complete application architecture. When components
accumulate business logic, data fetching, and state management, they
become difficult to test and maintain, turning the UI into a monolith.
The proposed solution separates UI composition (where Atomic Design
lives) from application architecture through a feature-driven
organization, with a strict rule that prevents UI components from
importing domain logic or accessing business state. 

 HIRUKI: A DESIGN HOUSE BETTING ON EMOTION IN AN ERA OF SYSTEMS AND
SCALE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 HIRUKI is a newly launched design house founded by designer Julen,
drawing on his experience at studios and teams including R/GA,
Collins, U.N.N.A.M.E.D., Google Creative Lab, and Apple Marcom Design,
and positioning itself as a collective that treats brand design as
something to be felt rather than optimised. Built around small, agile
teams and a philosophy rooted in emotion, context, and craft, HIRUKI
prioritizes depth over speed, collaborative authorship over rigid
structures, and intentional growth over scale, aiming to create brand
experiences that reveal meaning, coherence, and feeling over time. 

 DEFY REJECTS BLACK-AND-WHITE MINIMALISM FOR GERALD'S MENSWEAR BRAND
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The launch of Gerald, designed by Defy for heritage retailer Boyds,
focused on inheriting standards rather than copying luxury signals,
creating an affordable menswear brand that feels confident,
restrained, and authentic to visually literate men aged 25–40. Led
by Executive Creative Director Nik Greenblatt, the identity balances
classic typography with modern discipline, a craft-rooted colour
palette drawn from tailoring materials, and carefully considered
physical touchpoints, positioning Gerald as an intelligent entry point
into the Boyds ecosystem that has resonated strongly with customers
since launch.
