 SLUGGISH WORDPRESS? SEE HOW BARN2 SLASHED LOAD TIMES FROM 20 SECONDS
TO 2 SECONDS WITH KINSTA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Ever watched paint dry? That's how Barn2 Media, a busy WordPress
agency, felt waiting a painful 20 seconds for their admin pages to
load.

Even worse, client sites kept going offline during server crashes, and
their core business was suffering — all because of the poor
performance of their WordPress host.

Then they switched to Kinsta [5].

Now their admin pages open in just 2 seconds instead of 20 [4], and
they've enjoyed 99.9% uptime since. The secret? Kinsta isolates each
site in its own container, so one problematic site can't impact your
entire portfolio.

NEWS & TRENDS

 SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED A "JAW-DROPPING" NEW COLOUR – BUT YOU
CAN'T SEE IT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 U.S. scientists have discovered a new color, "olo," by using lasers
to stimulate only the medium-wavelength cones in the
retina—something not possible naturally. Described as a vivid
blue-green, olo can't be shown on screens or seen without special
equipment, making it a unique perceptual experience. Though its status
as a "real" color is debated, the find offers new insight into how we
see and understand color. 

 GOOGLE PHOTOS CAN NOW TURN YOUR PICTURES INTO ULTRA HDR IMAGES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google Photos has begun rolling out a feature that allows users to
convert standard images into Ultra HDR versions, enhancing brightness
range and color detail for compatible displays. Unlike older HDR
effects that just tweak brightness and shadows, this new tool adds a
“gain map” that stores extra brightness data for HDR screens,
though it doesn't replicate true HDR photo capture. 

 RUMOR: IPHONE 17 PRO COULD LAUNCH IN SKY BLUE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Leaks suggest that Apple may introduce a new Sky Blue color,
potentially inspired by its recent debut on the M4 MacBook Air, for
the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. According to a leaker, the prototypes
in Sky Blue look even better than the popular Sierra Blue from the
iPhone 13 Pro, making it a strong contender for the standout color at
the September 2025 launch.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO WRITE ERROR MESSAGES THAT ACTUALLY HELP USERS RATHER THAN
FRUSTRATE THEM (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Error messages are often neglected in digital design, leading to user
frustration when things go wrong due to unclear, whimsical, or
inconsistent communication. To improve this, designers should
anticipate possible errors, write in a clear, human, and active voice,
and always provide actionable steps for users to move forward.
Standardizing and documenting helpful, empathetic error patterns
builds trust and creates smoother, more supportive user experiences. 

 FUN FATIGUE – IS FORMALITY RETURNING IN BRANDING? (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 In the early 2000s, Silicon Valley's rejection of corporate formality
sparked a trend of casual, childlike branding that came to symbolize
innovation and trust. However, as trust declined during the pandemic
and digital spaces filled with low-quality, infantilized visuals, this
style lost its impact. Now, a shift is underway, with brands embracing
more formal, traditional design to convey trust, heritage, and clarity
amid the chaos. 

 WANT PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT USERS? LAY OUT WHAT'S AT STAKE IF THEY
DON'T (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective UX storytelling starts by establishing clear stakes. It
requires recognizing the key decision-makers and clarifying why the
current design is inadequate. Additionally, it's essential to present
the consequences of inaction. Vague data and generic processes can
weaken the overall message. Engagement and action become more likely
when findings are directly linked to business outcomes while conveying
a sense of urgency.

 IOS 19 WILL MAKE A DESIGN CHANGE THAT'S PERFECT FOR LARGE IPHONES,
PER LEAK (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 iOS 19, set to debut at WWDC, is rumored to introduce a usability
upgrade for large iPhone users by shifting the in-app search bar to
the bottom of the screen. This change will be aimed at making
one-handed navigation easier, especially on bigger models like the Pro
Max. Mockups showed apps like Messages and Music with the redesigned
search placement, suggesting Apple had prioritized function as well as
form in the upcoming update. 

 IS YOUR TEAM READY FOR AI-ENHANCED DESIGN? (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI design tools accelerate early-stage work, such as wireframing and
prototyping, but still require human refinement. Effective integration
demands thoughtful workflows, prompting skills, and collaboration.
Tools like UX Pilot and Vercel v0 offer different strengths. AI
enhances, not replaces, designers, and scalable use depends on team
readiness, systems alignment, and strategic implementation.
