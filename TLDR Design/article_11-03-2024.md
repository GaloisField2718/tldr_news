OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT JAKOB (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nielsen's recent argument that accessibility is a hopeless industry
and AI is the only viable solution for disabled people lacks data
ignores the work of well-known and respected experts. The claim that
accessibility is too expensive and inefficient provides more reasons
for business leaders to ignore the issue. It fails to acknowledge that
accessibility is not just about blindness and low vision but also
about a wide range of user experiences. 

 CHATGPT AND TONE: AVOID SOUNDING LIKE A ROBOT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 To nail the tone in AI-generated text, designers should use prompts
to rewrite existing content rather than generate new content, use
multiple-tone words rather than one, and ask for alternative outputs.
Sometimes, it takes ChatGPT multiple tries to write exactly what we
want.

 TEN WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE OUR BODIES (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In a roundup of 10 innovative wearable technologies, Samsung debuts a
smart ring with health tracking and AI, while products like a smart
menstrual cup and an air-purifying collar expand the boundaries of
health and digital integration. Among these wearables are devices for

 &WALSH'S DYNAMIC IDENTITY FOR QUALITY EXPERIENCE ALLOWS IT TO ADAPT
TO ANY CLIENT (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 QX is an independent full-service advertising agency on a mission to
foster purposeful interactions between brands and their audiences. It
needed a new branding that would make all clients and projects feel
welcome, so &Walsh developed a dynamic range of logomarks that
purposefully adapted to each client's unique personality. 

 KIRBY APPS AND REGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Kirby effect is about sucking in features already available and
delivering a worse experience. Keeping people in your app by
controlling the whole experience is a dominant practice driven by
business KPIs rather than the desire to improve the user experience.
The path to valuable experiences is more about integrating mature
solutions rather than creating your own (and worse) version of that
feature.

INSTEAD) (2 MINUTE READ) [17]
