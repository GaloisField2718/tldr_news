 THE NEW MSN LOGO FEELS LIKE A JOURNEY BACK IN TIME (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Microsoft recently updated the MSN logo, bringing back the iconic
butterfly symbol in a minimalist, retro-inspired design that resembles
the 1999 original. The redesign aligns with a trend of tech companies
reintroducing classic logos to evoke nostalgia. Some designers feel
the new look is overly simplistic - the updated logo has sparked mixed
reactions, with some appreciating the familiarity and others
criticizing it as lacking innovation.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY THE IDEA THAT ‘ANYONE CAN DO USER RESEARCH' IS A BAD ONE (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The misconception that "anyone can do user research" overlooks the
specialized skills needed to ensure reliability, validity, and ethical
standards. User research democratization aims to empower teams -
untrained individuals risk undermining UX by lacking essential
research skills and knowledge. 

 APPLE, YOU'RE DOING THE DYNAMIC ISLAND WRONG (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's Dynamic Island cleverly repurposes inactive screen space by
providing animations and visual elements for background activities
like music. However, its interactions feel counterintuitive. Tapping
on a Dynamic Island notification opens the app, taking users away from
current tasks, while a long press accesses widget controls. This
design choice undermines the Dynamic Island's multitasking potential. 

 NAVIGATIONS ON THE WEB (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Both hyperlinks and buttons can be used for navigation. While links
are traditionally associated with navigation, buttons within forms can
also trigger navigation. Form submissions can guide users to new
pages, just like links do.
