DOWN (5 MINUTE READ) [4]

pages. For users, this could mean a completely new way to interact
with the internet: less typing, fewer tabs, and more chatting with a
search engine.

 WHY MANY STARTUPS NEVER ACHIEVE GREAT DESIGN (AND HAPPY USERS) (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It can be challenging for even highly skilled professionals to
achieve meaningful results in startups because they need an
environment that allows them to flourish. Apple, Netflix, and Tesla
achieved their design success primarily by enhancing design maturity
and empowering their teams. The process to reach that stage of
maturity is not predictable, but startup founders can avoid pitfalls
such as failing to learn design basics, misinterpreting hiring
patterns, ignoring user research, and tolerating a feature factory
mentality. 

 BRILLIANT FRICTION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Adding positive friction to UX means adding effort while
simultaneously providing value to users. Coinbase, Headspace, and
Mailchimp successfully introduced intentional friction to user
experiences in flows like registration and onboarding, important UI
decisions, and purchasing.

 Designers exist as part of an extensive organizational system over
which they have limited influence. Instead of being fatalistic about
current challenges, they should stay proactive by keeping their eyes
open and addressing problems as they arise, investing wisely in the
long-term journey of their career, life, and legacy.

 IS THE PLANET THE MISSING MEMBER OF YOUR PROJECT TEAM? (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The internet's energy consumption has a significant environmental
impact. Designers need to treat the planet as a stakeholder in their
projects and intentionally incorporate sustainability into the design
process. Implementing a "climate budget" for digital products,
inviting the planet into design discussions, and setting
sustainability targets are crucial steps towards making the internet
more environmentally friendly.
