 IKEA'S MOST IKEA PRODUCT EVER (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ikea has partnered with Swedish designer Gustaf Westman to launch a
12-piece collection, headlined by a whimsical blue plate designed
specifically to hold 11 meatballs in a neat row. Westman has described
the design as a playful homage to Sweden's iconic holiday dish, aiming
to blend function with humor by giving each meatball its own
“throne.” The collection reflects both Westman's quirky style and
Ikea's accessible aesthetic.

 USER JOURNEYS VS. CUSTOMER JOURNEYS: WHY THE DISTINCTION MATTERS MORE
THAN YOU THINK (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 User and customer journeys aren't interchangeable terms—users
interact with products while customers pay money, and these roles
often differ in SaaS and B2B models. Companies that design only for
user delight without considering customer conversion risk create
beloved products with no viable business model. The most successful
products require mapping both journeys: user experiences that create
engagement, and customer experiences that drive revenue. 

 THE BEST DESIGN LEADERS CO-OWN METRICS, AND IT'S NOT AS SCARY AS YOU
THINK (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers must co-own business metrics, not by abandoning
user-centered principles, but by translating design impact into
outcomes executives understand. Demonstrate strategic value, build
trust with decision-makers, and gain greater influence within
organizations by aligning projects with Key Results, validating
desirability, measuring design quality, and framing results in terms
of revenue or cost savings. 

 EASY WILL ALWAYS TRUMP SIMPLE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Complex systems in both biology and software often evolve by reusing
what's already at hand, a process known in biology as exaptation and
in software as choosing the “easy” solution. While simplicity is
ideal, production pressures and human limits make complexity
inevitable. Resilience comes from having diverse tools, partial
knowledge across teams, and the ability to adapt systems
collaboratively over time.

 AND THE OSCARS BROADCAST GOES TO…YOUTUBE? (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 YouTube is reportedly in talks with the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences to broadcast the Oscars, potentially replacing
Disney/ABC when their current deal expires in 2028. The move would
align with YouTube's strategy of acquiring live event broadcasting
rights, similar to its NFL Sunday Ticket package, though Oscar
viewership has declined from 46 million in 2000 to 19.69 million in
2025. YouTube could leverage the opportunity to promote its creator
talent, as several YouTubers have already transitioned into feature
filmmaking with major distributors. 

 HOW CREATIVES CAN DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SKILLS AI WILL NEVER REPLACE (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Creatives can remain irreplaceable by mastering uniquely human skills
that AI cannot replicate. These include reading people beyond data
analysis, leveraging diverse life experiences for cultural
understanding, and embracing messy and imperfect creative processes
that break patterns. Building genuine relationships with clients and
learning to partner with AI while maintaining human decision-making
authority strategically is also essential.
