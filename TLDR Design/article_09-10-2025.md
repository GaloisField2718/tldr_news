NEWS & TRENDS

 FICTIONAL CHARACTERS ARE OFFICIALLY COMING TO SORA AS OPENAI MANAGES
COPYRIGHT CHAOS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's Sora team leader, Bill Peebles, announced that officially
sanctioned fictional character cameos are coming to the video
platform, following widespread unauthorized use of copyrighted
characters, including disturbing SpongeBob and Pokémon content. CEO
Sam Altman reversed the company's opt-out copyright policy over the
weekend, promising rightsholders more granular opt-in controls similar
to likeness rights and introducing revenue sharing for character
usage. The payment model details remain uncertain and will require
experimentation to finalize, though Altman claims rightsholders are
enthusiastic about enabling "interactive fan fiction" on the platform.


 DISNEY+ LAUNCHING NEW NAVIGATION AND UX DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Disney+ is rolling out a major redesign featuring a new top
navigation bar with dedicated tabs for Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN, as
well as an algorithm-powered "For You" homepage that personalizes
content recommendations. The overhaul includes visual updates, such as
cinematic poster artwork, video carousels, and new badge tags,
including "Season Finale" and "New Movie," to highlight timely
content. These changes coincide with Hulu's global launch on Disney+
on October 8, as the company prepares for a fully unified app
experience in the US in 2026. 

 AIRPODS MAX 2: HERE'S WHAT RUMORS SAY IS COMING NEXT (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Apple is reportedly developing a lighter AirPods Max 2 with an
updated H-series chip, finally adding features found in newer AirPods
models. However, the next-generation version isn't expected until
2027, so Apple plans to continue supporting the current USB-C model
for several more years.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEMS THAT DON'T SUCK: THE NO-BS GUIDE TO DESIGN-DEV
ALIGNMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A typography system that aligns designers and developers starts with
real screen designs, extracting patterns by function and organizing
them into clear hierarchies with explicit scales for size and weight.
The approach emphasizes using Figma variables for core properties and
semantic naming conventions that mirror code tokens, making systems
developer-friendly and eliminating guesswork. By establishing
structured, flexible systems that both teams understand, organizations
can reduce friction and focus on addressing meaningful problems rather
than engaging in endless pixel-pushing debates. 

 WHY TASTE MATTERS MORE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Taste—the cultivated ability to discern what matters—is more
crucial than technical knowledge or experience, which can be learned
or automated. While knowledge provides the "how" and experience brings
efficiency, taste creates vision, distinction, and cohesive design
with character. In an era where AI replicates knowledge efficiently,
taste remains the scarce, irreplaceable quality that truly
differentiates designers. 

 THE PERILS OF PREFERENCE TESTING, PLUS 4 GUIDELINES IF YOU MUST (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Preference testing in UX research often produces misleading results
because human choices are heavily influenced by cognitive biases such
as framing, choice blindness, substitution, and aesthetic-usability
effects. Studies show that what users say they prefer rarely aligns
with what performs best in usability, so researchers should prioritize
measurable metrics like task success, efficiency, and satisfaction
over opinions—and if preference questions must be included, they
should be supported by deeper analysis and independent usability
measures.

 SIX WINNING FIGMA MAKES—AND WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM THEM (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Figma's first global Make-a-thon attracted over 10,000 creators
competing for $100,000 in prizes. Showcasing innovative projects,
winners emphasized strategies such as defining clear structural
requirements, refining designs before building, utilizing modular code
organization, and leveraging shorter prompts for easier iteration. The
competition demonstrated Figma Make's capability to bridge design and
development, with projects ranging from custom font creators to
weather-based synthesizers and AR package designers. 

 DESIGNING AGENTIC LOOPS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Coding agents like Claude Code can brute force solutions by running
tools in loops, but require carefully designed "agentic loops" with
appropriate tools and credentials to be effective. Running agents in
YOLO mode (auto-approving commands) within sandboxed environments like
GitHub Codespaces balances productivity with security risks, including
data loss and exfiltration attacks. This approach works best for
problems with clear success criteria involving trial and error, such
as debugging, performance optimization, or dependency upgrades,
especially when supported by solid automated test suites. 

 HOW PONDER CHALLENGED BLAND BI BRANDING WITH TANDEM'S SEVEN-PIXEL
LOGO (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Tandem, a Copenhagen-based BI consultancy, partnered with PONDER to
create a bold, human-centred brand that breaks away from the
industry's generic, tech-driven sameness. Centered on the theme of
duality—balancing technical precision with commercial
accessibility—the new identity features a minimalist seven-pixel
gear logo, a flexible pixel-based design system, balanced typography,
and a warm yet professional color palette, resulting in a brand that
feels both systematic and approachable, reflecting Tandem's mission to
make data solutions people actually want to use.
