NEWS & TRENDS

 VIBE-CODING STARTUP LOVABLE RAISES $330M AT A $6.6B VALUATION (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Swedish startup Lovable raised $330 million at a $6.6 billion
valuation, more than tripling its worth since its $1.8 billion Series
A round in July. The vibe-coding platform, which lets users build apps
through text prompts, reached $200 million in annual recurring revenue
within a year of launching in 2024. Lovable serves major clients like
Klarna and Uber. Over 100,000 new projects are created daily on its
platform. 

 GOOGLE GEMINI IS GETTING AN AI VIDEO DETECTOR (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Gemini now includes an AI video detector that identifies
content generated by Google's AI models using SynthID watermarking
technology, which embeds imperceptible signals into generated media.
Users can upload videos up to 100 MB and 90 seconds long to verify if
they were AI-generated, with Gemini providing detailed analysis of
specific segments containing synthetic elements. The tool only works
with Google-created content and cannot detect videos from other AI
platforms, limiting its effectiveness as a universal verification
solution. 

 IF THE IPHONE FOLD IS THIS BOLD, I'M SOLD (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's long-rumoured folding iPhone is now widely tipped to launch
in 2026. Leaked CAD drawings suggest a shorter, wider form factor that
unfolds into a landscape-oriented inner display rather than a square
one. This design could make the phone more comfortable to hold while
closed and more useful when open. It could potentially run iPad-style
apps and offer a “best of both worlds” mix of portability and a
large creative canvas.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MAKERS VS. MARKETERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Japanese companies historically excelled at making quality products
but struggled with marketing, yet craft itself is becoming a powerful
brand-building tool when made visible to customers. ASICS recovered
from declining revenue by refining product specificity and quality
rather than increasing advertising, while brands like UNIQLO, Toyota,
and Nintendo demonstrate global success through engineered
functionality and obsessive process control. Small companies like
HUMAN MADE and Jacques Marie Mage have also grown significantly by
making their Japanese craftsmanship legible through careful production
details. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR UX RESEARCH HARD TO IGNORE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Strong UX research often faces resistance because it exposes internal
flaws, poor decisions, and uncomfortable truths that challenge
established authority and budgets within organizations. When
quantitative and qualitative data conflict, designers should reconcile
differences by tracking what's missing and triangulating findings
across multiple sources rather than dismissing either perspective.
Effective research presentation requires wrapping data in compelling
stories that emphasize shared goals, demonstrate alternative futures,
and provide clear paths forward that stakeholders can rally around. 

 HOW TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF FEATURES (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The TARS framework offers a simple, repeatable way to measure feature
impact by combining four metrics - Target audience size, Adoption,
Retention, and Satisfaction - then mapping features on a 2×2 matrix
to guide product strategy. By focusing on meaningful usage and user
experience rather than blunt metrics like conversion rate, TARS helps
teams connect UX work to real business value and decide which features
to improve, prioritize, or rethink.

 WHY TEXTURE MATTERS IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, AND HOW TO USE IT RIGHT (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Texture in graphic design exists both physically and digitally,
influencing viewers' perceptions, memories, and trust while preventing
flat, sterile layouts. Different textures convey distinct
psychological meanings: smooth surfaces suggest modernity and
precision, rough textures communicate authenticity and durability, and
soft gradients create a sense of calm. Designers should apply texture
intentionally and subtly in typography, backgrounds, and branding to
reinforce messages rather than distract, ensuring it aligns with brand
personality and remains legible across devices. 

 YAHOO MAIL'S NEW APPROACH TO UX: MAKING THE INBOX FEEL CALM AGAIN (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Yahoo Mail's latest update focuses on reducing inbox clutter through
a cleaner visual design with improved spacing, refined typography, and
a more cohesive interface that prioritizes clarity over feature
density. The team integrated AI in a restrained way to address
high-friction tasks, such as scanning for essential messages and
managing follow-ups, while keeping users in control and avoiding
unnecessary attention-grabbing elements. A new "Catch Up" feature
streamlines inbox clearing by reducing decision fatigue and
transforming email maintenance into a faster, more intuitive process. 

 WEIGHT WATCHERS REBRAND TRIES TO KEEP UP WITH LATEST WEIGHT LOSS
TREND (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Weight Watchers has unveiled a new, largely functional rebrand to
support its shift toward a healthcare-led model that includes access
to physicians and GLP-1 weight-loss drugs alongside its traditional
community and behaviour-change approach. The updated identity keeps
the WW name with a subtle progress-bar line, brighter blue tones, and
understated visuals, aiming to feel modern and credible rather than
flashy as the brand enters this new era.
