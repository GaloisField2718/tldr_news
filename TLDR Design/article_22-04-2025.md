camera bar, which some find unattractive. However, this design opens
the door for customization, with accessory makers already developing

 BRING YOUR IDEAS TO LIFE: VEO 2 VIDEO GENERATION AVAILABLE FOR
DEVELOPERS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Veo 2, Google's advanced video generation model, creates eight-second
clips from text or images. Developers can test it in Google AI Studio
and integrate it via the Gemini API. It simulates real-world physics,
supports cinematic styles, and enables creative tools like AlphaWave
and Trakto to scale video production from prompts or static assets.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CREATE A VISION THAT ACTUALLY GETS BUILT (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vision work is most effective when timed with planning cycles, rooted
in customer and business empathy, and co-created to foster alignment.
Bringing the vision to life through storytelling, prototypes, and
small testable steps builds momentum and reduces risk. Most
importantly, continuous iteration, visible progress, and regular use
keep the vision alive and guide the product's evolution. 

 THE OPPRESSIVE FOUNDATION OF MINIMALIST DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Minimalist design, often valued for clarity and efficiency, stems
from Western ideals that can unintentionally exclude other cultural
aesthetics. When framed as neutral, it may favor the familiar and
alienate others, reinforcing power through aesthetic norms. Inclusive
design means questioning these defaults, embracing pluralism, and
recognizing that simplicity isn't always universally meaningful —
sometimes, complexity better reflects diverse experiences. 

 THE PURPOSE OF UX DESIGN — WHY PRODUCT MANAGERS NEED UX DESIGNERS
AND DESIGN LEADERS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design thinking peaked around 2016–2018 but has declined as product
thinking gained traction. While both share similarities, design
uniquely enables innovation through abductive thinking and creative
translation. The oversimplification of design into fast sprints
diluted its value. True progress blends design and product thinking to
expand possibilities and drive meaningful innovation.

 CONVENIENCE VS. PROBABILITY SAMPLING IN UX RESEARCH (12 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Convenience sampling recruits participants based on ease of access

selection, offering more accurate, representative findings. It's ideal

 AI-GENERATED FONTS: ARE MACHINES DESIGNING THE FUTURE OF TYPE? (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI-generated fonts are transforming typography by offering speed,
customization, and creative possibilities. While they streamline font

legal ownership. Designers increasingly use AI as a collaborative tool
rather than a replacement. The future is likely to blend human
artistry with AI efficiency to expand typographic possibilities.
