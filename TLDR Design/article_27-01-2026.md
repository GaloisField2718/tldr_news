 DON'T LET YOUR BEST IDEAS LANGUISH IN A BACKLOG (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Vibe coding was supposed to give anyone the power to bring their
ideas to life. In reality: a designer or marketer builds something
promising, but engineers still need to spend weeks rewriting it to fit
production. More often than not, these ideas never leave the backlog.

v0 [4] closes the gap between vibe coding and production. Every prompt
generates production-ready code [4] that lives in your repository.
Designers work against the actual codebase. Refine layouts, tweak
components, and preview production as you work.

Stop opening tickets. Start shipping.

NEWS & TRENDS

 HERE'S THE NEW SIZE OF IPHONE 18 PRO'S DYNAMIC ISLAND, PER LEAKER (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The iPhone 18 Pro is rumored to keep the pill-shaped Dynamic Island
but shrink it by about 35%, reducing its width from roughly 20.8 mm to
13.5 mm, which should be noticeably smaller in everyday use. This
redesigned Dynamic Island is expected to be exclusive to the iPhone 18
Pro and Pro Max. 

 WIX REINVENTS WEB CREATION WITH NEW HARMONY AI WEBSITE BUILDER (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wix has launched Harmony, a new AI website builder that combines
human creativity with AI technology through "Aria," an AI agent
capable of executing design requests like updating color palettes or
redesigning pages via natural language commands. The platform allows
users to generate entire sites or specific sections while maintaining
full manual control through drag-and-drop editing, with Aria
understanding website context to prevent bugs or code breaks. Harmony
will roll out to all Wix users over the coming weeks, aiming to
simplify web design without sacrificing professional quality or
requiring coding knowledge. 

 'NOT JUST A TYPEFACE': VOLVO'S NEW FONT WANTS TO KEEP YOU SAFE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Volvo Centum is a bespoke typeface designed for in-car displays with
a strong emphasis on legibility, calmness, and driver safety.
Developed with Dalton Maag, the font is optimized for glance-based
reading at speed, aiming to reduce visual noise and cognitive strain
while driving.

 WHY THE NEW WEB REQUIRES A DUAL STRATEGY FOR EXPERIENCE DESIGN (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI bots now vastly outnumber human visitors. Anthropic sends over
6,000 crawlers per human referral compared to Google's 18 bots.
Despite lower volume, AI-referred visitors show 17x higher engagement,
creating a "Visibility Gap" between shrinking human reach and
expanding machine-readable layers. The solution involves creating
"human sanctuaries" for high-trust emotional experiences while
optimizing machine-readable content to control how AI agents represent
brands, preventing misrepresentation. 

 HOW I THINK ABOUT STARTING WITH VARIABLES (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Teams often struggle with starting design system variable structures
because it feels like setting a permanent foundation, leading to
analysis paralysis when considering scale, platforms, and themes
simultaneously. A recommended approach is to separate variables into
non-interactive buckets (environmental elements such as backgrounds
and text) and interactive buckets (behavior-driven elements such as
button states and feedback). Clarity matters more than completeness
initially, as variable structures only need to provide teams a shared
starting point rather than being perfect. 

 IS BILLING YOUR CLIENTS IN ADVANCE EVER OKAY? (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Creatives are split on billing clients in advance for unused budget:
it can work as a sign of trust and smart cash flow management, but
only with clear contracts, defined scope, non-refundability, and
expiry dates. Without those safeguards, it often leads to tax issues,
scope creep, and strained client relationships, making “it
depends” the most common—and wisest—answer.

 HOW THE IDEA OF CONVERGENCE SHAPED THE NEW IDENTITY FOR SINGAPORE'S
ARTSCIENCE MUSEUM (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Singapore's ArtScience Museum has unveiled a new brand identity ahead
of its 15th anniversary centered on “convergence”—the idea that
innovation emerges where art, science, technology, and culture
intersect—timed with the exhibition, Another World Is Possible. The
rebrand goes beyond aesthetics, using a flexible visual system, custom
type, and refreshed logo to position the museum as an active platform
for imagining and shaping future cultural and societal conversations. 

 BEYOND GENERATIVE: THE RISE OF AGENTIC AI AND USER-CENTRIC DESIGN (19
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift from traditional generative
AI by enabling systems to autonomously plan, execute, and persist in
tasks rather than simply responding to commands. There are four levels
of agent autonomy—observe-and-suggest, plan-and-propose,
act-with-confirmation, and act-autonomously. This post introduces
specialized research methods, such as agent journey mapping and
simulated misbehavior testing, to evaluate these systems. Metrics like
intervention rates, unintended actions, and rollback rates are
essential for measuring trust and accountability. 

 CELEBRATING ANALOG IN A DIGITAL WORLD (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tactile and analog practices reliably experience a renaissance during
periods of technological upheaval as people seek hands-on
counterpoints to digital dominance. As AI promises speed and bland
perfection, creatives are turning to time-consuming analog
methods—from cursive writing to vinyl records—to foster original
thinking and personal meaning. The resurgence reflects not a rejection
of technology but a reconsideration of expanded creative toolsets. The
slowness provides space for satisfyingly weird ideas absent from
machine learning datasets.
