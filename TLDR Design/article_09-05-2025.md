The new interface features a top navigation bar, tailored
recommendations, and a cleaner layout. Netflix is also experimenting

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GETTING THINGS "DONE" IN LARGE TECH COMPANIES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In large tech companies, “getting things done” means finishing
work in a way that decision-makers value, not endlessly refining
systems. Many mistake constant activity for progress, but real impact
comes from delivering visible, company-aligned results and moving on.
To be effective, employees must know when a project meets executive
standards, declare it done, and shift to higher-value work. 

 CREATIVE BRIEFS: THE BEST WAY TO TRACK DESIGN PROJECTS IF YOU'RE
SHORT ON TIME (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers often assume others understand the context, leading to
confusion. Creative briefs help clarify purpose, business goals, and
design problems. They align teams, provide direction, and highlight
user behavior changes. By asking key questions and focusing on the
“why,” briefs show the value of design beyond visuals and
aesthetics. 

 THE FUTURE OF DESIGN SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems are evolving from UI kits to infrastructure.
Automation, measurable ROI, and integration with code are now
essential. Systems teams must prove value, streamline workflows, and
scale impact through tooling, AI, and cultural influence. The future
lies in efficiency, not just consistency — design systems are
becoming design operating systems.

 HOW AND WHY DESIGNERS SHOULD TURN DOWN FREE PITCHING (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Despite long opposition, free pitching remains common in design,
especially in downturns, as many clients still expect unpaid work. At
a recent Design Business Association forum, leaders urged studios to
set anti-pitching policies, build client trust, highlight impact in
case studies, and confidently show their value, arguing this earns
respect and attracts better clients over time. 

 MATT WILLEY'S HELIONS BRAND HAS A TENDER INTENSITY IN FAVOUR OF TONE
RATHER THAN CONCEPT (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Matt Willey and Jonny Sikov designed the identity for Helions, Jack
Davison's new publishing house, to reflect the atmospheric feel of his
photography instead of a fixed branding idea. The bold, analogue-style
wordmark and red and black palette create a quiet yet intense look
that can grow with the publisher's ambitions. 

 THE HOLLYWOOD GUIDE TO UX PERSONAS: STORYTELLING THAT DRIVES BETTER
DESIGN (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Personas are like movie protagonists: compelling, motivated, and
rooted in real experiences. Strong personas have clear goals,
authentic voices, and relevant backstories. They guide design with
empathy and focus. Visuals should feel real, not generic, and teams
should avoid creating too many personas to maintain clarity in
decision-making and product direction.
