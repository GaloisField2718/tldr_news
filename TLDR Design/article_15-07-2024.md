 A new study by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted with
international consumer protection networks revealed that nearly 76% of
642 subscription-based websites and apps employ dark patterns. These
manipulative design techniques often compromise user privacy or
encourage unintended purchases. Common dark patterns include

features can be accessed through a desktop application, the web, and
on mobile devices. 

 THE AI-FOCUSED COPIED ACT WOULD MAKE REMOVING DIGITAL WATERMARKS
ILLEGAL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The COPIED Act aims to protect journalists and artists from AI
models' unauthorized use of their work. Introduced by a bipartisan
group of senators, the bill directs the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish standards for
authenticating and detecting AI-generated content through features
like watermarking. It could give enforcement powers to state attorneys
general and the FTC and allow content owners to sue for unauthorized
use.
