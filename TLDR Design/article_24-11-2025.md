NEWS & TRENDS

 NEW IPHONE 18 PRO DESIGN WILL REPORTEDLY MAKE TWO KEY CHANGES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is reportedly planning two main design tweaks for next year's
iPhone 18 Pro: a smaller Dynamic Island and a more seamless back glass
cutout that better blends with the aluminum frame. The overall design
will stay similar to the iPhone 17 Pro line, but with refined rear
glass, new color options, and possibly a thicker body to fit a larger
battery. 

 INTRODUCING NANO BANANA PRO (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image) is a state-of-the-art image
generation and editing model that uses Gemini 3's advanced reasoning
and real-world knowledge to create studio-quality designs with
improved text rendering in multiple languages. The model can generate
context-rich visuals, like infographics and diagrams, and maintain
consistency across up to 14 input images and five people. It offers
advanced professional creative controls. Nano Banana Pro is rolling
out globally across Google's products, including the Gemini app,
Google Ads, Workspace tools, and developer platforms. All generated
images will be embedded with SynthID watermarking for transparency. 

 META'S NEW IMAGE SEGMENTATION MODELS CAN IDENTIFY OBJECTS AND PEOPLE
AND RECONSTRUCT THEM IN 3D (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta has released SAM 3 and SAM 3D, advanced image segmentation
models that detect and track objects via text prompts and reconstruct
them in 3D. SAM 3 understands complex descriptions, enabling precise
photo and video editing. SAM 3D creates realistic 3D reconstructions
of objects and people from 2D images. It has applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and creative media.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BUILDING MOMENTUM WITHOUT MEETINGS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Using “micro moments” — short, precise, and complete
asynchronous messages — keeps teams moving without waiting for
meetings. They work like trail markers, giving just enough clarity for
the next step. Meetings waste collective time and kill momentum, while
vague async communication creates confusion. Micro moments require
effort: focusing on the outcome, choosing the right medium (text,
visuals, or video), and ruthlessly editing to include only what's
essential. Leaders especially must give direction that's clear but not
prescriptive. The payoff is huge - fewer delays, more autonomy, and
steady forward progress. 

 HOW TO SURVIVE CREATIVE BURNOUT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Creative burnout occurs when creative energy is depleted beyond
recovery, manifesting through dread, lack of motivation, and
depression-like symptoms that require distinguishing from other life
issues. Survival involves reaching out to friends and managers for
support, using tactics like discipline, taking breaks, laughing,
exercising, and traveling to restore energy. Prevention requires
changing work environments, diversifying projects, improving workplace
relationships, and developing self-awareness about personal needs and
what sustains creative motivation. 

 CREATIVITY IS HUMAN (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Graphic design students worry AI will eliminate their field, but
human creativity remains essential and irreplaceable by machine
intelligence. Historical technological disruptions expanded rather
than eliminated creative opportunities, suggesting a similar
trajectory for AI. While AI will transform design processes and create
new roles, genuine creative vision and individual expression continue
to distinguish human designers from algorithmic output.

 HOW&HOW'S CLEVER REBRAND OF MATERIAL PIONEERS EVERBLOOM MAY SURPRISE
YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The rebrand of Everbloom by How&How avoids eco-clichés and instead
positions the company like a luxury materials brand, focusing on
tactility, performance, and desirability rather than sustainability
messaging. Through a premium aesthetic—woven monogram, elegant
typography, sensory textures, and restrained storytelling—the
identity communicates confidence and timelessness, proving that
leading with product appeal can make the sustainability story more
compelling when it follows rather than leads. 

 HUMAN ENGINEERING (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Human engineering focuses on designing systems, tools, and
environments so that the right action becomes intuitive and the wrong
action becomes difficult. Using principles like spatial compatibility,
discoverability, natural mapping, constraints, and clear feedback, it
shows that most “human error” is actually design failure, and that
by reducing cognitive load and aligning design with human nature, we
can dramatically improve performance without requiring more effort,
training, or willpower. 

 NO-STOP SHOP: AUSTRIA'S UX LESSONS ON DESIGNING PROACTIVE GOVERNMENT
SERVICES (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Austria has achieved a "no-stop shop" model where government services
are delivered proactively without citizen action. This success stems
from structured inter-ministerial cooperation that embeds
user-centered service design within institutional collaboration,
ensuring policy goals and citizen experience develop together. The
approach is supported by robust digital infrastructure like the
Digital Austria Data Exchange platform, which connects over 30
registers and is expected to save businesses and citizens over 150
million euros annually by 2026.
