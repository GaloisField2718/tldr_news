NEWS & TRENDS

 OPENAI LAUNCHES NEW GPT IMAGE 1.5 MODEL OPTIMIZED FOR IMAGE EDITING
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's GPT Image 1.5 is a new AI model for image generation that
offers 20% lower API pricing and generates images up to 4x faster than
its predecessor. The model excels at preserving important details
during edits, handling multi-step modifications, and rendering small
dense text for tasks like infographics. GPT Image 1.5 is accessible
through ChatGPT's interface with pre-configured filters and via API
for developers. It has limitations with certain drawing styles and
scientifically complex images. 

 PIXEL SEARCH BAR CHANGES TO A MORE GENERIC GOOGLE UI (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google has replaced Pixel's distinctive on-device search overlay with
the standard Google app search, prioritising web and AI (Gemini)
results and making Pixel search feel more generic and less tightly
integrated with the launcher. While this aligns with Google's AI-first
strategy and simplifies access to AI Mode, it weakens Pixel's unique
identity and slows everyday local search for users who valued speed
and cohesion. 

 NEW BMW LOGO SPARKS DEBATE AS FIRST IRL PHOTOS APPEAR ONLINE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BMW has quietly refined its logo, making it flatter and more minimal
by removing chrome from the inner circle and flag while keeping a
matte black outer rim, signalling a subtle modernisation rather than a
full redesign. Reactions are mixed: some fans welcome the restrained
update, while others feel any change risks diluting the brand's
heritage, highlighting the delicate balance of evolving an iconic
identity.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PROTOTYPES ARE THE NEW PRDS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product managers at Figma are increasingly using Figma Make to create
interactive prototypes instead of traditional PRDs, enabling faster
exploration and more precise team alignment. The tool helps PMs
validate concepts through user testing, communicate nuanced product
behaviors, and make decisions by showing rather than describing
features. By building working prototypes early, teams pressure-test
assumptions, gather stakeholder buy-in, and create detailed
specifications that engineers can use as development foundations. 

 THE ANATOMY OF A GOOD DESIGN REVIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A good design review examines whether an interface guides users
effectively through a clear visual hierarchy, adherence to
accessibility standards, and brand consistency. The process varies by
stage—sketches need questions, prototypes need structure checks, and
launched products require comprehensive analysis across product,
structure, flow, and screen levels. Reviews focus on real user
behavior, identifying where people hesitate or get confused, with
annotated findings in Figma that tie recommendations to research and
principles. 

 WHY DARK MODE ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE: A UX PERSPECTIVE (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dark mode has become a popular design trend, but it's not a universal
UX solution and can actually weaken readability, increase cognitive
load, and create accessibility challenges when misused. While dark
mode works well in low-light environments and for creative or
entertainment applications, it struggles in bright settings, with
text-heavy content, and for users with astigmatism or low vision due
to contrast issues and halation effects. The most effective UX
strategy is to offer both light and dark modes based on user context,
not forcing dark mode everywhere simply because it looks modern.

 The Morson Group has streamlined its 19 brands into four clear

Vital (expert project teams), and Nexus (training)—to simplify

the company introduced a modern visual and verbal identity with a bold
colour palette, 45-degree design elements, geometric typography, and a
more human-focused art direction, guided by the principle of being
“uncommonly clever,” which has been well received internally and
externally.
