NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA IS ROLLING OUT CODE LAYERS FOR INTERACTIVE DESIGN (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Figma has introduced “code layers” in Figma Sites, enabling
designers to build fully interactive, production-ready web elements
directly within the design interface using AI-powered assistance and a
built-in code editor. This feature allows for rich
customization—such as animations, real-time data, and interactive
tools—without requiring deep coding skills, bridging the gap between
design and development. 

 META'S ADVANTAGE+ ADDS GEN AI TOOLS FOR ADVERTISERS AND AGENCIES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta announced new generative AI features for its Advantage+
advertising platform at Cannes Lions, including tools that transform
still images into dynamic videos and enable consistent branding at
scale. The updates include video highlights that extract key scenes,
Virtual Try-On expansion, and Creative Sticker call-to-action buttons
for Facebook and Instagram content. Meta reports that existing
Advantage+ campaigns already boost return on ad spend by an average of
22%, with backend AI improvements increasing conversions by up to 5%. 

 YOUTUBE LAUNCHES NEW SHOPPING PRODUCT STICKERS FOR SHORTS (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 YouTube has introduced new Shopping product stickers for Shorts to
help creators better monetize their content by making products more
easily shoppable. In testing, Shorts with these stickers saw over 40%
more product clicks than those using the older Shopping button format.
The feature allows creators to customize sticker placement and display
multiple products. It is rolling out globally this week.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN IS CARE (AND SENSING CARELESSNESS) (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The 2012 London Olympics' celebration of the NHS served as a powerful
symbol of national pride and the importance of care in public service.
Today, as technology—especially AI—increasingly shapes public
systems, there is a growing need to prioritize thoughtful,
human-centered design that resists carelessness and ensures equity,
trust, and meaningful impact in people's lives. 

 THERE'S TIME TO STOP THE APPLE-INSPIRED OBSESSION WITH GLASS UI
BEFORE IT STARTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple's new “Liquid Glass” design language, introduced with iOS
26 and macOS Tahoe, has sparked a resurgence of glossy, translucent UI
elements reminiscent of past trends, raising questions about
aesthetics versus usability. While visually striking, the return to
glass-like interfaces may be less about improving user experience and
more about preparing users for future technologies like XR, where
layered, semi-transparent UI could make practical sense. 

 THE RISKS OF LETTING AI DICTATE YOUR DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-powered "vibe coding" tools like Stitch quickly generate app
designs from simple prompts but produce generic solutions based on
assumptions rather than genuine user needs. AI should assist designers
as "eager apprentices" rather than dictate design decisions, since
effective design requires human questioning, problem-solving, and
understanding of user needs that AI currently cannot provide.

 A GUIDE TO CREATING EFFECTIVE PRODUCT FEEDBACK SURVEYS (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Effective product feedback surveys capture valuable user insights to
improve products and user experiences. Key steps include defining
specific objectives, writing clear questions, choosing appropriate
formats and distribution channels, timing surveys strategically, and
using proper tools for delivery and analysis. Best practices emphasize
keeping surveys short, mixing qualitative and quantitative questions,
and following up with respondents to close the feedback loop and show
that their input drives meaningful product improvements. 

 PROTOTYPES, TURF WARS, AND VIBE CODING: WHO DOES WHAT NOW? (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Vibe coding tools will intensify tensions between product managers
and UX designers as prototyping becomes where interaction design
decisions are made. UX designers should use vibe coding platforms for
prototyping while collaborating on whiteboards, freeing PMs to focus
on business value like monetization and market strategy rather than
micromanaging product details. Teams should leverage each member's
unique strengths, communicate effectively, and work collaboratively
rather than stepping on each other's toes in overlapping
responsibilities.
