 MIDJOURNEY WINS BATTLE OF THE IMAGE UPSCALERS, BUT WITH A CATCH (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 German stock photographer Robert Kneschke wanted to put
Midjourney‚Äôs new upscaler to the test so he generated an AI picture
on Midjourney in the standard 1024x1024 resolution and then ran it
through Midjourney‚Äôs 4x upscaler. He was impressed with the results.
However, the problem with Midjourney‚Äôs upscaler is that the user can
only run AI images generated on Midjourney through it so users can‚Äôt
upload their low-resolution photos to the platform. There are other
drawbacks too: Namely, the price.
