 A NEW CYBERTRUCK RECALL IS THE UMPTEENTH CHAPTER IN TESLA'S HISTORY
OF DESIGN ISSUES (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tesla's Cybertruck is facing yet another recall, this time for a roof
panel defect that could detach while driving. This adds to a growing
list of design and quality issues. From misaligned doors and rusting
stainless steel to failing electronics and a dangerous frunk, the
truck has been plagued with problems since its release. Despite Elon
Musk's claims of high demand and durability, the reality has been
repeated delays, manufacturing headaches, and frustrated owners
dealing with one issue after another.

I HOPED FOR (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GIMP 3.0 is finally here after years of stagnation, bringing a
sleeker interface, non-destructive editing, and improved Photoshop
compatibility while still lacking many advanced features. With better
performance, new text styling options, and UI customization, it is a
free Photoshop alternative for photo editing and basic graphic design.


 DESIGN PROCESSING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A 45-minute landing page challenge was held to highlight AI's role in
design. While AI helps non-designers start, decision-making remains
key. Experienced designers can use AI to enhance workflows, not
replace expertise. The event also helped highlight AI-related ethical
concerns and its limitations in producing novel, high-quality results.
