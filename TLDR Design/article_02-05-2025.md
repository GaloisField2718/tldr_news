 SIMPLE DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simple design promotes focus, ease of use, and purpose, making
products more intuitive and appealing. However, as products expand to
meet broader needs, simplicity can become limiting, risking usability
and clarity. The challenge is to evolve while keeping the clarity of
simple design, a balance few achieve. 

 FROM REACTIVE GRAPHICS TO THE AGENT ERA: REFLECTIONS ON THE EVOLUTION
OF DESIGN AND CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design has evolved constantly, from reactive graphics in the 1990s to
today's AI-powered agent experiences. Tools change, but the designer's
role remains: setting intent, guiding systems, and ensuring human
values shape the outcome. Programming is becoming more expressive, but
meaning and empathy still rely on human judgment. 

 “IT STINGS” – DESIGNERS DISCUSS HAVING THEIR WORK REPLACED (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Redesigns can stir mixed feelings, particularly when previous work is
replaced. Some accept it as part of the creative cycle, while others
feel discouraged. It's helpful to reflect on the reasons for change,
stay focused on new opportunities, and recognize that branding is
inherently temporary.

MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Fear of AI and job loss echoes past tech shifts, but history shows
innovation brings new opportunities and growth. As AI spreads, we must
design tools that boost human abilities, not replace them. A
human-centered approach ensures AI serves ethical and social goals,
requiring thoughtful and adaptive design. 

 IGNORING CHARACTER LIMITS CAN WRECK YOUR PRODUCT'S UX (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Character limits matter in UX writing to keep text fitting well

needs are key. These constraints boost clarity and creativity, leading
to better global content.

 In 1972, Vignelli's minimalist subway map aimed for clarity but
confused riders, leading to a return to geography-based maps in 1979.
