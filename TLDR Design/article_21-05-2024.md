 WHAT TELEPHONES CAN TELL YOU ABOUT GOOD DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bell Labs designed the touch-tone phone keypad in the 1950s to
increase accuracy and reduce connection time. The layout aligned with
natural writing patterns and placed frequently used keys for optimal
hand positioning based on Fitt's Law. This design, used around 40
trillion times, has saved approximately one million person-years and
underscores the importance of understanding user preferences and
cognition in product design. 

 THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND THE DETAILS SELL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Small interactions can significantly impact user experience and
differentiate a product. Examples like simplified link creation in
Notion, natural language date input in Things, and predictive text in
Gmail illustrate how small details can enhance usability. These
seemingly minor features become essential as users rely on them,
building loyalty and setting apps apart, making them more appealing
and competitive. 

 DESIGN INTERVIEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers should introduce themselves lightheartedly to stand out in
interviews. They must describe the project context, including the
deadline, team size, and responsibilities. They should highlight
research methods, share sketches and solutions, and discuss
constraints, user advocacy, and lessons learned to showcase their
problem-solving and adaptability.

 HOW TO CREATE YOUR UX DESIGN PRINCIPLES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creating UX design principles helps teams align, ensuring consistent,
high-quality work. The process involves running a workshop to define
and prioritize values, refining these into clear principles, naming
and formatting them, and setting criteria to measure success.
Visualizing the principles and driving their adoption across the
organization ensures they become integral to the design process,
fostering a cohesive and user-centered approach to design. 

 ON LEADING MARKETING AND DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Combining Marketing and Design enhances end-to-end user experience
and should be unified under one leader for efficient decision-making.
Companies should focus on customer experiences from awareness to

thinking across departments. 

 CAN AI DESIGN TOOLS REPLACE HUMAN DESIGNERS? (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI design tools, like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Adobe Sensei, enhance
the design process by handling repetitive tasks, analyzing data, and
generating ideas. While they offer speed and efficiency, they lack the
human touch needed for emotional and cultural nuances. The future of
design lies in blending AI's capabilities with human creativity,
allowing designers to focus on strategic and creative aspects and
creating more impactful and emotionally resonant work.
