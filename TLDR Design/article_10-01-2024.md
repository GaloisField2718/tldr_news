 SCALING THE DESIGN LADDER: SEEING LIKE A DESIGNER (8 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Instead of being recognized for their problem-solving power,
designers are celebrated for producing delight and empathy. We‚Äôve
been telling the wrong story about what design could do for teams and
organizations. The biggest value of design is not in building better
apps ‚Äî it‚Äôs building better ways of working.

 SEVEN VISUAL TRENDS AND HOW THEY‚ÄôLL UNFOLD IN 2024 (13 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 We are witnessing an increase in rapid trend turnaround led by an
increase in our interest in these trends. The looming visual trends
ready to take over 2024 are Graphic windows, which uses frames as a
graphic device, Kidcore with its doodles, cartoons, and artwork, Eerie

 CEREAL BRAND'S HILARIOUS BILLBOARDS COMMIT ALMOST EVERY GRAPHIC
DESIGN CRIME IMAGINABLE (1 MINUTE READ) [18]

 WHAT MAKES USERS ADOPT A NEW FEATURE OR TOOL? (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Research from Pendo suggests that 80% of added features are never or
rarely used, even for established products. Often, UX researchers
don't ask users to predict their future behavior since that
information can be unreliable. Nevertheless, frameworks are available
to assist in understanding user behavior and improving adoption rates.
