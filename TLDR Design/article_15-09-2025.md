OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNING FOR AI AGENTS AND UX PATTERNS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI agents are autonomous systems that perceive environments, make
decisions, and execute multi-step workflows independently, unlike
traditional AI tools that simply respond to prompts. This article
explores key UX design challenges, including trust, control balance,
and contextual awareness, while presenting four core patterns:
Progress Reveal (showing agent reasoning), Context Window (displaying
information sources), Teach-Back (explaining learning from
corrections), and Collaborative Workspace (enabling real-time human-AI
collaboration). Successful agent experiences focus on building
relationships through personality consistency, learning loops,
boundary setting, and recovery processes that strengthen user trust. 

 MOTION DESIGN ISN'T JUST EYE CANDY; IT'S UX INFRASTRUCTURE (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Motion design has evolved beyond visual appeal to become an essential
UX infrastructure that builds trust, conveys messages quickly, and
enhances user comprehension through strategic animations. Modern tools
like LottieFiles and the dotLottie format enable teams to implement
lightweight, scalable animations without compromising performance, as
demonstrated by companies like CNN Create, Gojek, and Wise. While AI
can support the creative process with layout suggestions and design
recommendations, effective motion design still requires human empathy
and brand understanding to create emotionally resonant user
experiences. 

 DESIGNERS, WHY DO WE ACCEPT BEING TREATED AS CHILDREN? (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Modern software designers often end up translating business needs
into visuals without real influence, leaving developers to shape the
product. To regain authority, designers need to move beyond static
mockups and engage directly with building, testing, and shipping real
products, closing the feedback loop and practicing true design.

 THE ARCHITECTURE OF HUMAN ERROR (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Good design isn't just about functionality or user experience, it
must also reduce human error and support recovery when mistakes occur.
The SRK model categorizes errors as skill-based (slips and lapses),
rule-based (misapplied logic), knowledge-based (judgment under
uncertainty), or violations (intentional deviations). Each type
requires different prevention strategies, highlighting that human
error is a product of design and should be addressed through systems
that align with cognitive processes.
