 DISNEY SIGNS DEAL WITH OPENAI TO ALLOW SORA TO GENERATE AI VIDEOS
FEATURING ITS CHARACTERS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Disney signed a three-year partnership with OpenAI and invested $1
billion, allowing Sora and ChatGPT Images to generate content
featuring over 200 characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star
Wars. Users can create videos and images using iconic characters like
Mickey Mouse and Darth Vader, though talent likenesses and voices are
excluded from the agreement. Despite previously suing Midjourney and
sending cease-and-desist letters to Character.AI over IP violations,
Disney will become a major OpenAI customer to build new products. 

 INSTAGRAM SUPERCHARGES CREATION AND FEED CONTROL WITH NEW EDITS APP
FEATURES AND “YOUR ALGORITHM” (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instagram's Edits app now includes pre-built templates, storyboards,
advanced text tools, and an iPhone lock screen widget for instant
camera access and quick content capture. The platform is introducing
"Your Algorithm" in the US, allowing users to view and modify the
topics Instagram uses to curate their Reels feed by adding or removing
interests. These updates aim to streamline content creation for
creators while giving regular users more control over their
algorithmic feeds, with similar Explore page features planned. 

 WITH IOS 26.2, APPLE LETS YOU ROLL BACK LIQUID GLASS AGAIN — THIS
TIME ON THE LOCK SCREEN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's iOS 26.2 adds another control to reduce Liquid Glass
transparency—this time for the Lock Screen clock—continuing
Apple's rollback via user-controlled settings after complaints that
the new glassy UI hurt readability. The update also brings AirDrop
codes, Reminders alarms, offline lyrics in Apple Music, AI features in
Podcasts, a Sleep Score on Apple Watch, and critical security patches
across Apple devices.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 STATE OF PRODUCT DESIGN: AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PROFESSION
(6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A study of 340 product designers found widespread overload and
burnout driven by chaotic management, constant multitasking, unclear
expectations, and poor cross-team communication. Career growth was
often blocked despite designers taking responsibility for their own
development. While most aren't afraid of AI and see it as a helpful
companion, job searches are getting significantly longer, feedback is
scarce, education feels disconnected from real work, and the
profession's challenges are increasingly seen as systemic rather than
individual. 

 THE TIMING PROBLEM IN DESIGN SYSTEMS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems often stall when perfectionism overtakes practicality,
as teams polish components endlessly while product teams build their
own solutions rather than wait. The most critical
elements—accessibility, semantic structure, token consistency,
stable APIs, and sensible defaults—can't be compromised, but
everything else is a judgment call that shouldn't delay shipping.
Components gain adoption by arriving when teams need them at 80%
completeness, then improving through real-world use rather than
theoretical perfection. 

 DESIGN TOKENS THAT AI CAN ACTUALLY READ (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most design tokens lack the context AI needs, leading tools like
Claude to misuse primitives rather than semantic tokens. Making tokens
AI-readable requires three elements: semantic naming that conveys
intent rather than appearance, descriptions explaining when to use
each token, and relationships showing which tokens connect or pair
together. Teams can start by adding descriptions to their top 10
most-used tokens, or by creating companion files that provide usage
guidelines without restructuring existing token systems.

 ARE YOU DESIGNING FOR THE USER'S VALUES — OR YOUR OWN? (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 As technology becomes more pervasive, the designer's role is shifting
from crafting interfaces to shaping ethical guardrails for how people
interact with machines. Empathy and traditional UX methods don't
capture user values, so designers often unknowingly impose their own.
Explicit ethical frameworks and evaluation tools are needed to surface
value trade-offs—such as inclusion, autonomy, transparency, privacy,
and well-being—and ensure products consciously align with users'
values rather than the team's assumptions. 

 GOOGLE IS BUILDING AN EXPERIMENTAL NEW BROWSER AND A NEW KIND OF WEB
APP (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's Disco is a new AI-powered browser that uses Gemini to turn
searches into “GenTabs”—interactive, task-specific mini apps
built from both AI suggestions and the web pages users open
themselves. Launched in Google Labs, Disco explores a more
collaborative, web-forward model where browsing, research, and
on-the-fly app creation merge. Google is still unsure whether GenTabs
should be temporary, shareable, or evolve into a broader product. 

 DESIGNING EFFECTIVE DASHBOARDS UX WITH ACTION DOTS (7 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Action dots are visual indicators that help dashboard users
immediately identify which metrics need attention by categorizing
values into five threshold states. Unlike traditional dashboard
indicators, which often create false positives or bury problems,
action dots appear only when metrics fall outside the neutral zone,
making critical issues instantly visible while letting non-urgent data
fade into the background. This approach addresses common dashboard
failures, such as information overload and unclear action priorities,
by focusing attention on what genuinely requires user intervention.
