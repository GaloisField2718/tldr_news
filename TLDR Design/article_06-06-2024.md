 YOUR GOOGLE PHOTOS APP MAY SOON GET A BIG OVERHAUL. HERE'S WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google Photos is set to receive a significant update that will
enhance its sharing and notification features. The overhaul will
include a new social-focused ‚ÄúSharing Activity‚Äù page, similar to
Instagram and Facebook, for more accessible interactions with likes
and comments on photos. A revamped storage meter will visually display
how much storage can be reclaimed, streamlining the deletion process.
These updates indicate Google's intention to integrate more social
elements into Google Photos, transforming it from a simple photo
backup app to a more interactive platform.

 FORMER TECH EXEC ADMITS TO FRAUD INVOLVING A SCHEME TO BOOST GETTY
IMAGES SHARES, AUTHORITIES SAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Former technology executive Robert Scott Murray pleaded guilty to a
single count of fraud for a scheme to inflate Getty Images' share
price. Once the CEO of 3Com, Murray attempted to manipulate Getty's
stock to sell his 300,000 shares for a higher profit. He issued
misleading news releases through his venture, Trillium Capital, and
announced a false bid to acquire Getty at $10 per share, nearly double
the previous closing price. The SEC deemed the bid ‚Äúfalse and
misleading,‚Äù noting Murray quickly liquidated his shares for
approximately $1.49 million without securing funds for the
acquisition.

 DESIGNER ENGAGEMENT REPORT (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The top three problems for designers at work right now are limited
ability to conduct research and receive feedback, lack of design
strategy, and no career progression opportunities. Design is an
unequal partner in the design/product/engineering trifecta, which is
why most companies don't have design leadership and most designers
need to work with multiple product managers. 

 DESIGNING FOR PRIVACY IN AN AI WORLD (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI offers immense potential but needs responsible development to
ensure privacy and user safety. This article dives into generative AI
and privacy, emphasizing the need for embedded privacy protections. It
discusses practical ways to mitigate privacy risks, especially during
the application phase, and highlights the importance of collaboration
and innovation to balance privacy with AI's benefits. 

 HOW TO GET PAST YOUR LIMITATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers often limit their growth by focusing only on visual
creativity and avoiding decision-making, resulting in mediocre work as
non-designers make vital decisions. To break this cycle, designers
should develop leadership and influence skills, expand their
definition of design talent to include these abilities, and encourage
more designers to take on decision-making roles.
