 ADOBE WANTS TO HELP YOU GET BETTER AT AI – AND LAND A CREATIVE JOB
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe's Future of Skills survey of 2,000 people found that 44%
consider creativity essential for future careers, while 38% cite AI
skills, yet nearly one in five workers feel unprepared for an
AI-driven workplace. The research reveals that 33% of employers report
significant AI and automation skills gaps among candidates, with those
staying in roles long-term 50% less likely to feel ready for AI tools.
To address this gap, Adobe is expanding its Digital Academy across the
UK with new courses and certifications, aiming to reach 30 million
people globally by 2030 through partnerships and platforms. 

 RUMOR SUGGESTS APPLE COULD KILL DYNAMIC ISLAND WITH UNDER-DISPLAY
CAMERA (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple may remove the Dynamic Island cutout and hide the front-facing
camera under the display for the 20th anniversary iPhone in 2027,
aiming for a clean, all-screen design. These rumors come from
anonymous sources, so they should be taken cautiously, and plans could
change before the release. 

 'VIBE CODING' NAMED WORD OF THE YEAR BY COLLINS DICTIONARY (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Collins Dictionary named "vibe coding" its 2025 word of the year,
referring to creating apps or websites by describing them to AI rather
than writing code manually. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy coined
the term in February to describe how AI enables programmers to bypass
traditional coding and focus on conceptual instructions. While the
practice allows non-programmers to build basic applications through
simple descriptions, more complex tools still require coding
expertise, and the results aren't guaranteed to work perfectly.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WE WANTED SUPERMAN-LEVEL AI. INSTEAD, WE GOT BIZARRO (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A research paper by Apple revealed that LLMs don't genuinely reason
but instead match patterns that resemble thinking. Their logic
collapses into pure prediction as problems become increasingly
complex. Modern AI has evolved from transparent symbolic systems to
statistical methods, and now to today's generative models, trading
logical transparency for fluent prediction that appears human but
lacks true understanding or accountability. The real danger isn't AI
outthinking humans, but flooding the world with convincing illusions
that sound correct while being fundamentally indifferent to truth. 

 WHY THE SMARTEST DESIGNERS MOVE BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW FIDELITY (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers strategically shift between high and low-fidelity designs
to guide conversations and control feedback, using simplified
wireframes to focus teams on structure and user experience rather than
visual details. Blending fidelities helps direct attention to specific
changes while signaling what's open for discussion versus finalized.
Several Figma plugins now automate this conversion process, making it
practical for designers to defidelity screens quickly and use visual
simplicity as a communication tool throughout the design process. 

 AFFINITY'S FREE GAMBIT COULD SHATTER ADOBE (BUT IF IT DOESN'T, THAT
TELLS US A LOT) (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Affinity has made its professional creative suite—photo editing,
vector design, and page layout—completely free, offering a strong
alternative to Adobe Creative Cloud. However, because it lacks Adobe's
AI-powered tools, the industry's response will reveal whether
creatives can work without AI or have become dependent on it,
highlighting a divide between valuing traditional craft versus
AI-assisted convenience.

 WHY IT'S SO HARD TO TALK ABOUT PREVENTING LOSS OF TRUST WITH DESIGN
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design leaders struggle to defend trust-preserving decisions because
prevention is not reflected in quarterly reports, creating a
"prevention paradox" where successfully avoiding catastrophic events
goes unrecognized. Interviews with 18 design leaders reveal five
measurement frameworks: pairing satisfaction scores with support data,
tracking task completion rates, balancing qualitative and quantitative
research, using acquisition-engagement-retention-churn metrics, and
referencing industry case studies as proxies. Success requires
partnerships with product managers, customer support teams, and data
analytics teams to translate abstract trust concerns into concrete
business outcomes that stakeholders can understand. 

 THE INVISIBLE GAP: DESIGNING FOR USERS WHO RECONSTRUCT, NOT JUST READ
(8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Around 1.19 billion people use English as a second language, meaning
most web users navigate content in a language they learned later,
which requires active “context reconstruction” — decoding,
translating, and rebuilding meaning before acting. Designing for this
process with plain language, consistent terms, clear structure,
accessibility, and early localisation not only aids non-native
speakers but also improves usability for all users, reduces cognitive
load, and benefits business outcomes by lowering support needs and
improving comprehension. 

 WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF A COLLEAGUE STEALS YOUR CREATIVE IDEA? (7
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Idea theft at work is common and undermines respect and professional
credibility. The recommended approach is to document your
contributions, address the colleague privately and respectfully,
reclaim ownership during meetings if needed, escalate to management
with evidence if the behaviour persists, and strategically protect
your ideas, while knowing when to prioritize your wellbeing in toxic
environments.
