 SCALABLE DESIGNS ARE A BUSINESS PROBLEM THAT DESIGNERS CAN HELP SOLVE
(8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designing for scale in specific fields, like Healthcare Technology,
Financial Technology, and Enterprise UX, is critical. Often, these
fields need to display hundreds of items on well-designed websites and
do it in a way that's easy to understand. Simplifying your designs is
the best place to start if you're designing for these situations. This
article provides a solid foundation for that.

[9] 

 A practical set of visual design rules can significantly impact a

near-black and near-white instead of pure black and white, saturation
of neutrals, high contrast on critical elements, and opting for
optical alignment instead of mathematical alignment.

 WHY YOU SHOULD USE PX UNITS FOR MARGIN, PADDING, AND OTHER SPACING
TECHNIQUES (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Content is most important to users when customizing their viewing
experience. In many cases, spatial spacing is less important than the
content for users to accomplish tasks. That's the logical use case for
px units. 

 TRULY SEMANTIC (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A token is semantic when it possesses certain qualities. Semantic
tokens don't suggest values. They're always generic and don't depend
on each other. 

 DO THE DESIGN DIGGING (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A research and design team that forgets or fails to dig around
what‚Äôs been learned before is doomed to repeat the learnings. How do
we avoid this? A good design process starts by digging around and
learning what‚Äôs been learned and done before.
