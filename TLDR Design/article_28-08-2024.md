 PROCREATE'S CEO THINKS THE TECH INDUSTRY IS KILLING CREATIVITY. HE'S
RIGHT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 James Cuda, CEO of Procreate, has declared that the company will not
use generative artificial intelligence in its products, which has
polarized the tech and creative communities. Creatives overwhelmingly
support this stance, seeing it as a commitment to human-driven
artistic processes, while some in the tech world predict it will not
age well. Cuda emphasizes that Procreate aims to support genuine human
creativity rather than instant AI-generated outputs, which he feels do
not align with the creative journey. 

 WHY STARTUPS NEED UX DESIGNERS AS FOUNDERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When thinking of a startup founder, one often imagines a coding
expert or an energetic marketer, but UX designers are emerging as
influential founders. UX designers possess a deep understanding of
user behavior and needs, ensuring a product that not only looks good,
but functions optimally. They emphasize the significance of user
feedback throughout development, helping to build something beneficial
from the start. With their focus on usability and aesthetics, they can
make even MVPs attractive and ensure user-centered, adaptable product
development. 

 LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS, NOT YOUR COMPETITORS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prioritizing customer feedback over competitor actions when designing

provide valuable insights, the most successful designs stem from
understanding and addressing customers' needs. By following a
user-centered design process, you can create relevant,
customer-centric products that build loyalty and meet user
expectations, ensuring long-term success.

MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Empathy in Design Scale is a tool that measures empathy in
design. It assesses three dimensions ‚Äî Emotional Interest, Personal

on self-reports, there may be bias due to social desirability.

technical feasibility for engineers, and user experience for designers
‚Äî and communicating effectively, designers can foster better
partnerships and solve more significant problems.
