 GET YOUR DESIGNS TO PRODUCTION FAST, WITHOUT BREAKING THINGS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Vibe coding was supposed to make it easier to make cool stuff. But
without security guardrails, it often turns into a big mess.

v0 [4] finally makes it possible for designers to build
production-ready code without the anxiety. It follows the same best
practices that software engineers have relied on: code review,
testing, and continuous improvement.

And because v0 is built on Vercel [4], it offers a path from prompt to
production on the same platform that powers and secures the world's
largest websites and apps.

So yes, by all means, move fast. But why break things if you don't
have to?

NEWS & TRENDS

 EARLY LOOK SHOWS APPLE'S LIQUID GLASS-STYLE BLUR EFFECTS COMING TO
ANDROID 17 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is testing blur effects in Android 17 that resemble Apple's
Liquid Glass design, with translucent backgrounds appearing in system
interfaces like the volume panel. The frosted visuals are tied to new
UI flags and create a layered appearance in which content appears to
float above blurred backgrounds. The feature remains under development
and may change before Android 17's final release, alongside other
updates, including private contact sharing and motion sickness
reduction tools. 

 GOOGLE PHOTOS BRINGS PROMPT EDITING TO INDIA, AUSTRALIA, AND JAPAN (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is expanding prompt-based AI editing in Google Photos to
India, Australia, and Japan, letting users make natural-language edits
on everyday photos—on-device, across many Android phones, and in
multiple local languages—while adding C2PA credentials for
transparent AI attribution. The move matters because it brings fast,
private, conversational editing to huge mobile audiences, positioning
Google against Adobe, Apple, and Samsung with a simpler, more
accessible workflow despite some early limits with complex scenes. 

 LEAKER MAKES UNLIKELY CLAIM ABOUT IMPROVED IPHONE 18 TELEPHOTO
PERFORMANCE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A leaker claims Apple is testing variable-aperture lenses and even
teleconverters for the iPhone 18's telephoto camera, but the report is
vague and widely seen as unlikely. While variable apertures could
offer slightly better depth-of-field control on Pro models, the
teleconverter claim is probably a mistranslation or misunderstanding
rather than a real feature.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW TOP COMPANIES ARE USING AI IN THEIR DESIGN WORKFLOWS (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Leading tech companies are implementing structured AI workflows in
design: Atlassian uses pre-built templates and instruction files to
control AI prototyping, while Meta designers automate execution tasks
while maintaining manual processes for research and strategy. Teams at
Tesco are building custom Figma plugins that connect to live website
data, and Faire deployed an internal AI chatbot called Fairey to
analyze user queries and synthesize research interviews efficiently. 

 ON CODING AGENTS AND THE FUTURE OF DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Coding agents like Claude Code represent a new phase of responsive
design by stripping applications down to their essential primitives.
This shift forces organizations to clarify what their products
actually do, much like mobile-first design revealed that simpler
interfaces often better serve user needs. This agent-driven future
elevates design to pure strategy, where competitive advantage comes
from honestly expressing capabilities rather than cluttering
interfaces with organizational complexity. 

 IS THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK THE MOST IMPORTANT DESIGN OF OUR TIME? (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Doomsday Clock, now set at 85 seconds to midnight, endures as one
of the most powerful pieces of graphic design ever made, distilling
complex existential threats—nuclear war, climate change, and AI
risk—into a simple, universally understood metaphor. Though
subjective and imprecise, its strength lies in provoking awareness and
urgency, proving that design's impact isn't accuracy but its ability
to focus global attention and spur debate.

 I LEARNED THE FIRST RULE OF ARIA THE HARD WAY (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A developer added role="link" to a button element, intending to style
it differently, which broke keyboard activation and caused screen
readers to announce conflicting roles, even though it passed automated
accessibility tests. Removing the ARIA attribute and using a CSS class
instead restored proper functionality, demonstrating that semantic
HTML elements already provide necessary accessibility features. ARIA
should only supplement native elements to convey dynamic states, such
as aria-expanded, rather than override their inherent roles and
behaviors. 

 STILLS 2026 TRENDS REPORT POINTS TO THE RISE OF HUMAN-CENTRED DESIGN
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In a sea of AI-polished sameness, Stills' 2026 Photography in Design
Trend Report argues that work cuts through by embracing play,
imperfection, texture, and risk—making humanity visible again
through colour, detail, and intentional weirdness. Across trends from
scrapbook aesthetics and cyber goth to maximalism, grunge, surrealism,
and sensory storytelling, the message is clear: audiences crave bold,
tactile, emotionally resonant work that feels made by people, not
machines. 

 NEW LAUNDRY BRAND EAT DIRT PRIMED TO SHAKE UP THE ECO-FRIENDLY MARKET
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Former ad execs Jordan Woolley and Catherine Barr have launched Eat
Dirt, a plant-based, biodegradable laundry detergent positioned as an
eco-friendly yet design-forward alternative, packaged in bold,
illustrated tins meant to be seen rather than hidden. Aiming at
environmentally and design-conscious consumers, the brand uses
irreverent naming, playful illustration, and premium pricing to shake
up a conservative category and reach buyers beyond traditional
supermarket channels.
