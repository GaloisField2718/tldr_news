HIS COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has acquired Jony Ive's AI hardware startup, io, in a $6.5
billion all-equity deal. The move brings ex-Apple designers to OpenAI
and marks its boldest step into consumer hardware. Ive and his firm
LoveFrom will lead design efforts, aiming to create AI-powered devices
that move “beyond screens.” Ive will shape future ChatGPT versions
and new AI products, escalating competition with Apple as generative
AI hardware takes shape.

MONSTER (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

to develop stylish Android XR smart glasses that emphasize fashion and
wearability. Integrated with Gemini AI, the glasses will offer photo
capture, navigation, and live translation via built-in cameras, mics,

Roblox alternative, VRChat is also expanding into branded experiences,
including a partnership with McDonald's Japan.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GOOD DESIGN COMES FROM LOOKING, GREAT DESIGN COMES FROM LOOKING AWAY
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Great design balances detail with a broad view but, more importantly,
requires stepping beyond existing solutions. While fundamentals
matter, over-referencing others can stifle creativity. Designers like
Dieter Rams, Susan Kare, and Jony Ive made breakthroughs by trusting
their own instincts. The hardest—and most valuable—skill is having
the confidence to follow your unique perspective, embracing intuition
and risk to spark true innovation. 

 DOES EFFICIENCY KILL LOVE? (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The design community has shifted towards care and craft over sheer
efficiency. Industry leaders now see AI less as a productivity tool
and more as a creative partner that supports meaningful work. Minimum
viable play can spark innovation - designers should pursue personal
projects free from market pressure. While AI speeds up work, the focus
should be on crafting unique, emotionally rich experiences.
Collaboration is still key. 

 THE WHEEL OF NOTHING (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many websites use a rotating headline tactic—dubbed “The Wheel of
Nothing”—to cycle through audience types in a bid for inclusivity,
but it often feels generic and unfocused. Even top design firm
Pentagram recently used this approach, though its deeper messaging
shows a much clearer brand identity. The takeaway: strong branding
demands focus—trying to appeal to everyone risks resonating with no
one.

 WE'RE SO BACK, WHY EVERYONE IS SUDDENLY SO THIRSTY FOR DESIGNERS (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The design world is swinging back to taste-driven, design-led
products, sparked by Jony Ive's talk and Airbnb's skeuomorphic
redesign. This shift pushes back against metrics-first development in
favor of products with soul and care. Designers welcome the return of
conviction-based design, though it's unclear if taste guarantees
business success. Still, Y Combinator's push for designer-founders
signals design's growing edge as code becomes commoditized.

and an intuitive keyword-based navigation system to reflect the
initiative's poetic and exploratory spirit.
