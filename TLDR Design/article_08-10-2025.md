 WIRING INTERFACE TO INTENT (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs excel at understanding intent and manner, making them powerful
tools for creating adaptive interfaces that respond to user requests
with appropriate UI components rather than text. This article
demonstrates how to build "call-and-response UI" systems where the LLM
acts as a design decision-maker, interpreting user intent and
returning structured data that tells the interface which component to
display, essentially translating natural language into
machine-readable interface instructions. By constraining outputs to
predefined UI patterns and utilizing prompts as collaborative design
specifications, teams can create experiences that adapt to user needs
while leveraging LLMs' strengths in understanding context and
mitigating their weaknesses in handling facts. 

 FROM PIXELS TO PROMPTS: NAVIGATING THE GENERATIVE AI REVOLUTION IN UX
(12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Generative AI is transforming UX design by automating execution
tasks, such as creating prototypes and analyzing feedback, allowing
designers to shift from pixel-pushing to strategic roles focused on
systems thinking, ethical oversight, and prompt engineering. The
technology serves as a collaborative tool across all design phases,
but it requires human judgment to ensure that outputs are inclusive,
contextually appropriate, and aligned with user needs. UX designers
must develop AI literacy and master prompt crafting while maintaining
responsibility for critical thinking, as their irreplaceable value
lies in asking the right questions rather than merely producing
artifacts quickly.

 INTENT-BASED UI IS REPLACING NAVIGATION—ARE WE DESIGNING OURSELVES
OUT OF THE INTERFACE? (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Traditional navigation is dying as interfaces shift toward
intent-based design, where systems anticipate user needs rather than
requiring explicit menu choices—seen in platforms like Spotify,
TikTok, and ChatGPT. While this approach excels at routine tasks, it
risks stripping users of cognitive maps and autonomy, creating
disorienting "black boxes" that trap people in algorithmic bubbles and
fail when predictions are wrong. The solution lies in predictive
systems that augment, rather than replace, traditional navigation,
offering intelligent suggestions while maintaining a transparent
structure and user control. 

 BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS FOR UX DESIGNERS FROM FIGMA'S 2025 AI REPORT (6
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Figma's 2025 AI report reveals that AI is fundamentally reshaping
design workflows by improving speed and efficiency, though 60% of
designers don't yet see quality improvements. The research shows that
design skills are becoming increasingly valuable for AI products, with
most AI builders considering design at least as critical as for
traditional products. However, the unpredictability of AI introduces
new complexities in prototyping, user testing, and determining
transparency levels. Designers currently use AI primarily for research
tasks, such as desk research (38%) and data analysis (40%), rather
than for creative work.
