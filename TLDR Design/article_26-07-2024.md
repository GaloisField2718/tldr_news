 Kamala Harris's design team created a new brand for her presidential

seriffed "for" in Frame Italic, was swiftly approved by her campaign
leadership. Further brand evolution is expected once a running mate is

 HOW TO CREATE A TIMELESS LOGO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Creating a timeless logo is a dream for brand designers. Successful
companies like Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola serve as prime examples. A
critical factor in making a timeless logo is the company's long-term
success and market leadership rather than the logo's graphical
qualities alone. Having a logo designed by a renowned designer,
avoiding trendy gimmicks, and meticulously sweating the details
contributes to creating a logo that stands the test of time. 

 A WASTED LIFE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 James Wright's poem, "Lying in a Hammock," ends with the line, "I
have wasted my life," sparking reflection on the narrator's existence.
This contemplation aligns with Hannah Arendt's vita activa and vita
contemplativa concepts, where creativity bridges the gap between
thought and tangible reality. Design, like poetry, transforms abstract
ideas into enduring artifacts, contributing meaningfully to the world
despite the pressures of modern capitalism. 

 GREAT DESIGN ISN'T PIXEL PERFECT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While perfectionism in design ensures high-quality output, it can
hinder timely product delivery, especially in startups. A
pixel-perfect obsession is common early in a design career, but
seasoned designers should focus on solving user problems rather than
flawless visuals. Balancing clear goals, planning, seeking feedback,
and knowing when to step back helps manage perfectionist tendencies
and promotes effective, timely solutions.

 THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF GOOD DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design significantly influences a brand's success and user
experience, though its value may be subjective and not immediately
appreciated by clients. To bridge the value gap, designers should
focus on communicating the importance of their work through value,

behind UI design practices.
