NEWS & TRENDS

 TIM COOK QUIETLY TAPS JOHN TERNUS TO OVERSEE APPLE'S DESIGN TEAMS:
REPORT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple has quietly expanded John Ternus's remit to act as executive
sponsor for all design, giving him greater strategic influence. Design
leaders will still formally report to Tim Cook. The move positions
Ternus as a leading internal CEO successor. 

 COMIC-CON BANS AI ART AFTER ARTIST PUSHBACK (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 San Diego Comic-Con reversed its AI-friendly art show policy after
artists publicly protested, now banning AI-generated material from the
exhibition altogether. Artists Tiana Oreglia and Karla Ortiz led the
backlash, arguing the policy normalized exploitative technology that
threatens their livelihoods and diminishes creative spaces. The
convention changed its rules within 24 hours, shifting from allowing
non-sale AI art with disclosure to prohibiting any AI-created work. 

 EVERYONE'S SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT TRUMP'S BOARD OF PEACE LOGO (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Donald Trump unveiled a new entity called the Board of Peace at the
World Economic Forum, complete with a shiny gold logo that closely
resembles the United Nations emblem. The near-copy—featuring a gold
wreath and a globe reduced to North America—has sparked online
ridicule, especially since no official design rationale has been
offered.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHO ARE WE REALLY DESIGNING FOR? (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An inclusive design workshop with the Korea Disability Arts & Culture
Center flipped the design process by starting from excluded
users—challenging hidden “reference user” assumptions in
everyday products and services. By mapping personas, journeys,
emotions, and scalability across permanent, life-stage, and
situational constraints, the workshop showed that designing for
exclusion often creates solutions that benefit everyone and protect
user independence. 

 DESIGNERS OFTEN DO INVISIBLE WORK THAT MATTERS. HERE'S HOW TO SHOW IT
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX designers face growing pressure to demonstrate business value as
AI tools can now generate visuals quickly, making their strategic work
appear invisible to stakeholders. Designers must translate their
research, user insights, and problem-solving into measurable business
outcomes by connecting user behavior to revenue and cost savings.
Rather than focusing on visual execution, UX professionals should
position themselves as essential troubleshooters who bridge user
needs, business objectives, and technical possibilities in an
AI-integrated workplace. 

 CURSOR FOR DESIGNERS GUIDE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code enable designers without coding
experience to build functional web applications through "vibe-coding".
The guide demonstrates how to create a personal portfolio website with
AI chat functionality in 48 hours and a growth design tool in 5 days,
using a workflow that includes planning with Claude Code, iterating on
natural language prompts, and deploying to GitHub and Vercel.
Step-by-step instructions cover how to set up these tools, build
projects from static sites to full web apps with authentication and
databases, and deploy them with custom domains.

 AMONG EQUALS CREATES ULTRAVIOLET PURPLE NEW BRAND FOR STORRD (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 New convenience brand STORRD has launched its first store in Camden,
positioning itself as a radically different, more uplifting take on
the “top-up” shop. Working with London agency Among Equals, the
brand uses an ultraviolet purple palette, bold logo, and highly

 WHY MULTIMODAL UX IS BECOMING THE NEW STANDARD FOR DIGITAL PRODUCTS
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Multimodal UX enables users to interact with digital products through
multiple modes like touch, voice, gesture, and vision, working
together naturally, reflecting how people actually behave in
real-world contexts. This approach improves accessibility for over 1
billion people with disabilities and situational limitations while
increasing user satisfaction through choice and control. Successful
implementation requires harmonious design patterns, contextual testing
in messy environments, and careful restraint as AR, VR, and AI-powered
interfaces become mainstream. 

 PHARRELL WILLIAMS REVEALS ‘FUTURE LIVING CONCEPT' DESIGNED IN
COLLABORATION WITH NOT A HOTEL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pharrell Williams unveiled Drophaus, a water droplet-inspired "future
living concept" created with Tokyo-based Not a Hotel, as the
centerpiece of his Louis Vuitton A/W 2026 menswear show in Paris. The
compressed glass structure blurs indoor-outdoor boundaries and
features the Homework furniture series, designed with intentional "ten
percent imperfection" in irregular forms and textured surfaces.
Williams' collection explored timelessness through reimagined menswear
archetypes, using technical fabrics like reflective yarns and crystal
embroidery that evoke water droplets.
