 REDDIT WILL HELP ADVERTISERS TURN ‘POSITIVE' POSTS INTO ADS (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Reddit has launched a new alpha advertising feature called
Conversation Summary Add-ons that places positive user posts directly
below advertiser content. The feature allows users to scroll through
community posts under ads and view summaries of user opinions about
advertisers. Reddit also introduced Reddit Insights, an AI-powered
social listening tool, as part of announcements made alongside the
Cannes Lions Festival. 

 TIKTOK LAUNCHES NEW AI TOOLS FOR ADVERTISERS, INCLUDING AI AVATARS
FOR VIDEO ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TikTok has launched new AI advertising tools, including
image-to-video and text-to-video capabilities, plus a Showcase
Products feature that allows AI avatars to hold or wear advertised
items. These additions expand TikTok Symphony, the platform's existing
AI advertising toolkit. The new features, which reflect an
industry-wide trend toward automated ad creation using generative AI,
will be available globally to advertisers in the coming weeks through
TikTok Symphony Creative Studio. 

 MAX WILL SHOW AUTOPLAYING VIDEO PREVIEWS PICKED BY AI (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Max has rolled out autoplaying video previews for its content
library, using an AI tool to identify “standout” scenes from shows
and movies. The AI aims to reduce manual editing by selecting clips
that highlight key moments, which editors will then finalize for
preview placement. This update is part of broader changes to Max's
interface and branding, including an official rebrand back to HBO Max
later this summer.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHAT THEY'RE NOT TEACHING IN DESIGN CLASS—AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT
IT (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Despite its critical importance, design education fails to teach
business fluency; as Netflix's VP of Design, Steve Johnson,
emphasized, "Design without business is just decoration." Early-career
designers can bridge this gap by taking marketing courses, networking
with cross-functional professionals, consuming business-focused
content, and gaining hands-on experience building real products.
Understanding business goals enables designers to collaborate more
effectively and create a greater impact since design, craft, and
business strategy work together rather than in opposition. 

 AVOID PREMATURE SOLUTIONS: HOW TO RESPOND WHEN STAKEHOLDERS ASK FOR
CERTAIN DESIGNS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stakeholders often suggest specific design solutions, creating
anchoring problems that limit design exploration and can lead to
suboptimal outcomes. The 5 Whys technique helps uncover underlying
business needs, while "How Might We" statements reframe
solution-focused requests into neutral problem statements. Addressing
these anchoring issues immediately in meetings prevents weeks of
frustration and opens up better design possibilities. 

 FROM FUNCTION TO EMOTIONS IN UX DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google's Material 3 Expressive design system reflects a shift toward
creating emotional connections through design. Research shows that
expressive designs perform better across usability and user
satisfaction metrics. Don Norman's three levels of emotional
processing (visceral, behavioral, and reflective) and Aarron Walter's
Hierarchy of User Needs demonstrate that emotional design must build
upon functional, reliable, and usable foundations. Emotional design
helps products stand out in competitive markets by creating lasting
user connections and increasing engagement and loyalty beyond basic
functionality.
