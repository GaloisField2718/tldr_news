OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DATA VS. FINDINGS VS. INSIGHTS IN UX (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UX research moves from data (observations) to findings (patterns) to
insights (actionable value). Designers should aim for theoretical
saturation, not statistical significance, to avoid costly mistakes.
The “What Happened + Why + So What” framework turns findings into
stories that highlight business value, making UX insights harder to
dismiss in stakeholder meetings. 

 HOW TO AVOID ACCIDENTALLY GIVING UP CREATIVE CONTROL OF YOUR DESIGNS
(8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers can avoid shadow planning, or copying existing designs, by
not relying on analogies like “It's like Amazon but for pets.”
Instead, they should define value propositions by identifying target
users, key problems, provisional personas, and unique selling points.
This keeps designs contextually relevant and protects creative
control, especially as AI threatens to standardize interfaces. 

 WHY JAGUAR'S REBRAND FAILED, AND WHAT IT CAN TEACH US (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Jaguar's 2023 rebrand by Accenture Song aimed to position it as an
all-electric luxury brand by 2026 but ended up alienating loyal fans,
confusing new buyers, and cutting sales nearly in half. Critics say it
dropped emotional and visual assets without a strong new identity. As
Jaguar seeks a new agency, the lesson is clear: rebrands should evolve
identity and preserve emotional connection, even in a tech-driven
future.

 HOW TO PICK YOUR BATTLES AS A DESIGNER (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designers should choose battles wisely in companies that claim to be
design-led but sideline design in decisions. Despite evidence of
better performance, many still see designers as service providers,
leading to burnout. Spot chances to influence, like leadership
interest or design debt work, but know when to walk away. In
interviews, ask about design's role in strategy, reporting, impact,
and past challenges.
