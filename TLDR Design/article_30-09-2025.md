 NEXT YEAR'S IPHONE FOLD COULD BE MUCH THINNER THAN IPHONE AIR (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's rumored 2026 iPhone Fold is expected to debut as the
company's first foldable, measuring just 4.5–4.8mm when
unfolded—about 20% thinner than the new iPhone Air's 5.6mm. Folded,
it will be 9–9.5mm thick, roughly matching current Pro models,
making it both pocket-friendly and Apple's thinnest iPhone yet in use.


 FIREFLY BOARDS REDEFINES IDEATION WITH NEW MODELS AND AI-POWERED
EXPLORATION FEATURES (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe released Firefly Boards worldwide, an AI-powered ideation
platform featuring new video models Runway Aleph and Moonvalley Marey
alongside existing partners like Google, Luma AI, and Pika. The
platform now includes Presets for quick style generation, Generative
Text Edit for in-visual text modifications, and Describe Image for
converting visuals into editable prompts. 

 ADIDAS' NEW LOGO HAS A SECRET DESIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adidas has introduced a redesigned logo for its 2026 World Cup kits,
featuring a hidden monogram that becomes visible under UV light. The
updated emblem subtly integrates a repeated three-stripe pattern
within the classic logo, creating a holographic effect that plays on
the brand's identity. This design refresh balances innovation with
tradition, reinforcing Adidas' position at the intersection of sport
and fashion.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY BRANDS ARE RE-EMBRACING THE POWER OF THE TAGLINE (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Taglines are experiencing a resurgence as brands like Nike, Ford, and
TAG Heuer deploy concise phrases to cut through increasingly complex
marketing landscapes and AI-driven changes in consumer behavior.
Effective taglines require strategic clarity about their specific role
within the broader brand system, rather than serving as standalone
solutions to marketing challenges. The most successful taglines, like
Nike's evolution from "Just Do It" to "Why Do It?", work by building
on established brand-audience dialogues and functioning as integrated
parts of a comprehensive storytelling approach. 

 THE FUTURE OF PRODUCT DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product design is rapidly transforming as AI becomes foundational,
with designers expected to be hands-on builders who can prototype and
ship products to production, regardless of their seniority level. The
traditional boundaries between design, product management, and
engineering roles are dissolving, requiring designers to think in
systems, embrace AI tools on a daily basis, and demonstrate their
value through actual working prototypes rather than documentation or
handoffs. Designers must shift from being specialists who create
pixel-perfect deliverables to curators who utilize AI to rapidly
iterate and ship, while developing a personal learning syllabus to
stay relevant in this AI-native era. 

 HOW TO MARKET YOURSELF WITHOUT FEELING GROSS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Self-promotion can feel awkward, but for creatives it's essential —
and it doesn't have to be cringey. You can build visibility and trust
by focusing on honesty, consistency, and sharing what excites you.
Treat it as play rather than pressure. Over time, self-promotion
becomes less about bragging and more about confidently connecting your
work with the world.

 HOW DO YOU DESIGN WHEN YOUR COMPANY ISN'T SURE WHAT THE ROADMAP LOOKS
LIKE? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 When companies face uncertain roadmaps due to shrinking back to a
startup size, designers should focus on work that saves future effort
by documenting designs and organizing requirements for deprioritized
features that might be revisited. Design debt should be tackled
strategically, but explained in business terms that demonstrate value,
such as resolving consistency issues that prevent user errors or
reducing the number of support tickets. Uncertain periods also provide
ideal opportunities for user research, as the timing cost is lower
when teams are already waiting for direction. 

 I STOPPED USING FIGMA FOR 70% OF MY PRODUCT DESIGN WORK… AND MY
OUTPUT DOUBLED (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A designer found that jumping straight into Figma led to aimless
designing and constant redesigns because the real bottleneck was
unclear thinking about who the product served and what problem it
solved. To address this, they developed a repeatable Notion workspace
and Figma system that handles strategic pre-design work—such as
problem statements, competitive analysis, user research, and
information architecture—before any visual design commences. This
process reportedly doubled their output and helped build multiple
six-figure products. It now forms the foundation of their teaching
method for product design students. 

 FROM PRODUCTS TO SYSTEMS: THE AGENTIC AI SHIFT (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The rise of agentic AI is reshaping design and product development,
moving from static, deterministic tools to autonomous systems that
generate adaptive experiences on demand. At DataRobot, this shift has
led to agent-aware templates, design systems, and governance practices
that help balance speed with quality, highlighting that while AI
accelerates execution, the uniquely human work of deep understanding,
judgment, and craft is more valuable than ever.

 HOW TO CREATE A TYPOGRAPHIC HIERARCHY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Effective typography hierarchy requires understanding content first,
