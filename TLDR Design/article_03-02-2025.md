 WHY BIG THINGS DON'T GET DONE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Productivity works like a glass jar - first, fill it with strategic
“rocks,” then pebbles, which represent incremental improvements,

to handle minor tasks.

 AI's future depends on ethical design that prioritizes human
flourishing, transparency, and inclusivity. Practitioners must ensure
AI enhances creativity, respects diversity, and safeguards privacy. AI

opportunities by fostering collaboration, accountability, and
adaptability.
