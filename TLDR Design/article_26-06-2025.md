NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE HEARD YOUR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE LIQUID GLASS CONTROL CENTER (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple addressed readability issues with its Liquid Glass Control
Center feature in the second iOS 26 developer beta by making the
background more opaque. The original beta's excessive transparency
created visual clutter that made Control Center difficult to read at a
glance. While some color bleeding still occurs with certain buttons,
the changes significantly improve over the initial implementation. 

 IMAGEN 4 IS NOW AVAILABLE IN THE GEMINI API AND GOOGLE AI STUDIO (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has released Imagen 4, its most advanced text-to-image model,
through the Gemini API and Google AI Studio. The release includes
significantly improved text rendering capabilities. It includes two
variants: the standard Imagen 4 at $0.04 per image for general tasks
and Imagen 4 Ultra at $0.06 per image for more precise prompt
adherence. All generated images include invisible SynthID watermarks
for transparency and authenticity verification. 

 NEW LEAK GIVES US A GLIMPSE OF BLACK IPHONE 17 PRO AND IPHONE 17 AIR
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Leaked images of dummy units suggest the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17
Air may feature a sleek all-black design, sparking excitement for a
potential return of a true pitch-black iPhone. However, these models
are based on rumors and not confirmed by Apple, so the final design
may differ when the phones are officially unveiled in September.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BREAKING DOWN SILOS WITH HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 IDEO's Shanghai team used human-centered design to break down silos
between leadership and product teams at a consumer products company.
When the project sponsor criticized designs as "soulless," IDEO
facilitated perspective-sharing exercises and consumer research to
align teams around shared goals. The approach helped transform
organizational barriers into collaborative innovation, moving beyond
traditional "Made in China" production models. 

 AI BROWSERS: DIA'S CHAT-BASED UI AND THE FUTURE OF THE WEB (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Browser Company has launched Dia, a new AI browser that lets
users chat with web pages for recommendations and contextual
information, in invite-only beta. While Dia's current functionality
resembles basic ChatGPT capabilities, it represents a paradigm shift
from traditional web browsing to conversational web interaction.
Industry experts suggest AI browsers could evolve into super-apps with
dynamic interfaces, fundamentally changing how people navigate and
interact with the web within five years. 

 QUALITY IS A TRAP (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Discussions about "quality" in design often resurface online but tend
to be vague, subjective, and ultimately unproductive, as the term is
slippery and context-dependent. Rather than chasing a nebulous ideal
of quality, designers should focus on clear, actionable principles
like usability, accessibility, performance, and user needs—areas
that offer tangible value and measurable outcomes.

 THIS THEORY ABOUT JONY IVE'S AI HARDWARE DEVICE SEEMS INCREASINGLY
LIKELY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Court documents have confirmed that the mysterious AI hardware device
from Jony Ive and Sam Altman is not a wearable, ruling out
smartwatches, rings, glasses, and similar gadgets. Growing speculation
now points to a smart pen. This unobtrusive, desk-friendly device
could function like a wearable without technically being one, aligning
with both their hints and the idea of a third essential desktop item
alongside a laptop and phone. 

 AFTER HOURS' NEW IDENTITY IS EXPRESSIVE, LAYERED, AND ALWAYS ON THE
MOVE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 After Hours, a fully remote design studio, has unveiled a bold new
identity that better reflects its expressive and extroverted
personality, moving away from a safe but forgettable brand.
Co-founders Shy Trutwein and Jasmine Gallagher reimagined the studio's
look as a flexible, slightly unhinged visual system rooted in themes
of time, symbolizing their journey from a pandemic-era design hotline
to a global studio that thrives on shifting perspectives and seasonal
nomadism. 

 BEYOND JOURNEY MAPS: DESIGNING FOR CONTROL IN AI UX (11 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 AI is reshaping digital experiences, shifting UX from linear user
flows toward dynamic interactions where control constantly shifts
between human and machine. To design for this new reality, teams must
embrace co-agency—building systems that are transparent, steerable,
and trust-driven, with interfaces that balance initiative, oversight,
and shared authorship.
