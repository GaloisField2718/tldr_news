 APPLE NAMES 2025 DESIGN AWARDS WINNERS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple announced the winners of its 2025 Design Awards just before
WWDC, recognizing 12 apps and games across six categories. The winners
primarily consisted of indie apps and startups, with generative AI
apps notably absent for the second consecutive year. Notable winners
include Watch Duty for Social Impact, which provides wildfire
information during California emergencies, and Play for Innovation in
developer prototyping. Apple emphasized how developers utilized its
tools to create better user experiences rather than focusing on
AI-centric applications. 

 INTRODUCING OUR DEV MODE MCP SERVER: BRINGING FIGMA INTO YOUR
WORKFLOW (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma announced the beta release of its Dev Mode MCP server, which
integrates Figma directly into developer workflows to enable
design-informed code generation. The server works with agentic coding
tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code by providing design
context through the Model Context Protocol standard. It offers pattern
metadata, screenshots, interactivity examples, and content details to
help LLMs generate code that matches codebase patterns and design
intent. Future updates will include remote server capabilities and
deeper codebase integrations based on user feedback. 

 GEMINI APP GETS UI TWEAKS, SWIPE LEFT TO LAUNCH LIVE GESTURE (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has updated the Gemini app, introducing UI tweaks like a
swipe-left gesture to launch Gemini Live and reverting the plus menu
back to a vertical list layout. The prompt bar has also been updated,
reordering chips to place Video (Veo) first and introducing a new
Canvas icon featuring a split circle. While the swipe gesture remains
in beta, other updates, including compact menus and visual
refinements, are now live in the stable Google app.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AI IS FLIPPING UX UPSIDE DOWN: NAVIGATING THE NEW ERA OF DESIGN (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is fundamentally disrupting UX design by shifting focus from
traditional visual interfaces to AI-first systems that minimize or
eliminate complex UIs. Tools like Figma risk obsolescence as AI
generates interfaces from simple prompts, while conversational and
predictive systems handle user interactions behind the scenes. UX
professionals must evolve beyond pixel-perfect design to embrace
strategic AI integration, developing prompt engineering and AI
analytics skills. The transformation presents opportunities for
designers who adapt by treating AI as a collaborative partner rather
than viewing it as a threat to traditional design methods. 

 YOUR MANAGER IS NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Commiserating with direct reports may feel natural, but it's highly
corrosive to team trust and organizational cohesion, subtly
encouraging division, victimhood, and poor cross-team collaboration.
Instead, effective managers should take a therapist-like
approach—empathetic but curious and objective—using questions,
perspective, and clear frameworks to steer conversations toward
constructive action rather than shared grievances. 

 WHY IS QUALITY SO RARE? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 True quality remains rare despite rapid advances in technology and
scale because the pursuit of craft—deliberate, caring attention to
detail—has been sacrificed for speed, cost, and metrics. Yet quality
is a choice: when individuals and teams intentionally center care,
taste, and belief in their work, they create products that feel right,
resonate deeply, and succeed organically.

 BRANDON DROPS THE AGENCY SPEAK WITH NEW IDENTITY (4 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Brandon has unveiled a bold rebrand, dropping "The Brandon Agency" to
reflect its evolution into an integrated, insight-driven growth
partner with a clear, provocative voice and dynamic visual identity.
This complete repositioning emphasizes momentum, creative risk-taking,

 COMMON PROBLEMS WITH DESIGN PATTERN LIBRARIES (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design pattern libraries face critical challenges, including
inconsistent component usage across teams, weak governance and
maintenance, accessibility gaps, and disconnected workflows that
create implementation drift. Solutions involve establishing clear
documentation with usage guidelines, implementing strong governance
frameworks with semantic versioning, building accessibility audits
directly into components following WCAG standards, and connecting
libraries to development workflows through code-synchronized tools. 

 THE UX BUTTERFLY EFFECT (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The design of social media platforms like TikTok, driven by feedback
loops to maximize user engagement, has led to significant unintended
consequences including worsening teen mental health, environmental
degradation, and social isolation. Tools like systems maps, impact
ripple canvases, and iceberg visuals help designers anticipate these
broader effects by making visible the complex, often hidden,
relationships within systems.
