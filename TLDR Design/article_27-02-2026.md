NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA PARTNERS WITH OPENAI TO ADD CODEX SUPPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma and OpenAI have integrated Codex using MCP to create a two-way
design-to-code workflow that allows designers and engineers to iterate
continuously without traditional handoff friction. The integration
enables structured design context to inform code generation, speeds up
prototyping and QA, supports multi-model AI strategies, and emphasizes
governance to ensure quality, consistency, and alignment with design
systems. 

 THREADS IS TESTING A SHORTCUT TO QUICKLY START DM CONVERSATIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threads is testing a new shortcut that lets users type “DM me” or
“Message me” in a post or reply to generate a clickable link that
opens a one-on-one chat. Messages from mutual followers go straight to
the primary inbox, while others are filtered into Message Requests to
limit spam. The feature is rolling out to select users in the US and
Canada as Threads continues to expand messaging tools and surpass X in
daily mobile usage, reaching 141.5 million active users compared to
X's 125 million. 

 CREATE STUDIO-QUALITY MARKETING ASSETS WITH PHOTOSHOOT IN GOOGLE
LAB'S POMELLI (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pomelli, a free Google Labs tool, introduced Photoshoot, a new
feature that uses AI to transform simple product photos into
professional studio-quality marketing images. The tool helps small and
medium businesses create on-brand visuals by selecting products,
choosing templates, and automatically applying business aesthetics.
Pomelli also includes improved image generation, editing, and campaign
creation tools to help businesses grow their digital marketing
efforts.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LIFE AFTER FIGMA IS COMING (AND IT WILL BE GLORIOUS) (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Figma's dominance in design tools is weakening as AI coding tools
like Cursor and Claude enable designers to work directly with code,
making traditional design platforms feel slow and outdated. The future
of design will likely shift toward open, code-based tools that
integrate directly with development environments rather than being
controlled by a single platform. This evolution will allow designers
to work collaboratively with engineers on production code, eliminating
the need to maintain separate design files and components. 

 DESIGN DOCS CONSIDERED HARMFUL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design docs are often outdated artifacts that describe systems that
don't exist, serving primarily to provide organizational comfort and
approval rather than actually guiding implementation. The fundamental
problem is that detailed prespecification forces teams to make many
decisions with little information, which contradicts the core
principles of iterative development learned from failures. Design docs
delay actual coding and learning, creating a false sense of
predictability in an inherently uncertain software development
process. 

 THE PROBABILITY TRAP (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Generative AI can quickly produce polished outputs, but it generates
statistically probable, conventional solutions rather than ones shaped
by deep exploration, tradeoffs, and contextual understanding. Real
design creates value through messy, iterative exploration and
sense-making. AI is most powerful when used intentionally—as a
baseline, brainstorming partner, or stress-tester—rather than as a
shortcut that replaces critical thinking.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILD HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMIZED APPS QUICKLY (WEBSITE) [11] 

 FlutterFlow is a visual app development platform that helps users
build high-quality, customized mobile and web applications quickly
using over 200 pre-designed UI elements and a visual Action Flow
Editor. 

 AI DESIGNS, FULLY EDITABLE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Create fully-editable, on-brand slides, social posts, PDFs, and
diagrams with AI on a real canvas you control. 

 CREATE ISOMETRIC LAYERS AND GROUPS (WEBSITE) [13] 

 The Easometric Figma plugin uses SSR30⁰, the most popular and
flexible method for creating isometric artworks.

 SKETCHING WITH CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sketching with code involves treating programming as a flexible
ideation tool rather than a rigid blueprint, allowing for rapid
exploration without the constraints of formal design systems. The
author starts with low-fidelity code prototypes (simple HTML divs) and
uploads hand-drawn wireframes to AI tools to generate multiple
variations, focusing on technical structure before visual polish. This
approach leverages AI's ability to read visual input and generate
functional code, enabling faster exploration of ideas through
programming than traditional design tools. 

 WHY THIS NEW ICE-CREAM BRAND ONLY MAKES SENSE AFTER DARK (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Snooz is a sleep-friendly ice cream brand built on the insight that
most ice cream is eaten at night, replacing typical ingredients with
calming ones like chamomile and magnesium. How&How created a fully
night-oriented brand identity—dark palettes, moon-infused
typography, late-night photography, and an adult, conspiratorial
tone—demonstrating how a strong insight, when followed boldly and
coherently, can define an entire creative system. 

 RANDO SANS — A HANDWRITTEN FONT THAT CYCLES VARIATIONS AS YOU TYPE
(17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Designer Beau Maher created “Rando Sans”, a free
handwritten-style font that cycles through multiple versions of each
character to create a pseudorandom effect using OpenType's Contextual
Alternatives (CALT), after discovering the built-in RAND function was
limited and poorly supported. By building complex class-based
substitution logic (and using ChatGPT to automate repetitive code), he
solved duplication and sequencing issues to make the font feel more
naturally varied—showing how designers can experiment with technical
systems to solve creative problems.

 NATIVE HTML COMPONENTS DON'T GUARANTEE GOOD UX (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Native HTML components like reset buttons, date inputs, and tooltips
often provide a poor user experience despite being built into
browsers. 

 FIBONACCI SEQUENCE INSPIRES SURREALIST BALI BEACH CLUB'S ARCHITECTURE
(2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A beach club in Bali features surrealist architecture inspired by the
Fibonacci sequence.
