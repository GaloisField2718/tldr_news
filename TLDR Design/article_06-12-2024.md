OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN SYSTEMS ARE DEAD. LONG LIVE DESIGN SYSTEMS (9 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Commodified design systems hinder adoption and should integrate into
core product processes as platforms or operations. Simplifying roles,
language, and tools can enhance organizational understanding and
buy-in. Repositioning design systems as essential infrastructure
within product teams ensures efficiency, inclusivity, and quality,
overcoming disillusionment and fostering industry-wide adoption.

READ) [8] 

 Poor UX research practices, such as unrealistic scenarios,
unchangeable scores, and a lack of participant observation lead to
unreliable results and hinder meaningful product improvements. Quality
user research is essential for effective design. Avoid using flawed
methodologies as they undermine trust and do not produce actionable
insights. 

 UNSOLICITED ADVICE TO MY YOUNGER DESIGNER SELF (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Starting as a designer at a large tech company like Microsoft
requires embracing continuous learning and adapting to the role.
Navigating complex structures, understanding decision-making, and

communication, especially in hybrid settings, and aligning daily tasks
with a larger purpose inspires motivation, fosters growth, and
sustains impact.
