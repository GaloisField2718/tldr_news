 THE EFFORT PARADOX IN AI DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 People value effort in product interactions, as seen with Betty
Crocker cake mixes, IKEA furniture, and AI tools. Over-automation can
reduce user satisfaction, trust, and engagement. Effective AI design

OR FICTION? (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI can enhance unmoderated usability testing by generating follow-up

AI-generated questions remain relevant and adaptive to improve the
quality of usability testing without hindering participant engagement.

approaches. Challenges include flexible interfaces, prompt-guided user

 IPHONE LEGACY STILL “WEIGHS” ON SIR JONY IVE (4 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Sir Jony Ive reflected on his time at Apple, the iPhone's societal
impact, and the evolving role of design in a BBC interview. He
discussed his collaboration with Steve Jobs, iconic product

 AI IS A PRISM, NOT A SOURCE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Creativity works like light through a prism, refracted into new
forms. Like a prism, AI amplifies ideas but doesn't generate a spark.
It expands creative potential, splitting and refining possibilities
while final artistic decisions remain human. AI enhances exploration,
but meaning and authenticity still require a human touch.
