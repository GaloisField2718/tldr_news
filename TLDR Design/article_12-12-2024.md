OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 TO DESIGN GREAT PRODUCTS, YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THEM FIRSTHAND EARLY
ON (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designing user-friendly experiences requires firsthand knowledge to
identify usability issues and novice struggles. Experts often
overestimate users' understanding, leading to blind spots. Techniques
like heuristic evaluation and competitive research help uncover
critical design insights. Leveraging a novice's perspective early on
ensures a better user experience and fosters critical questioning
throughout the design process. 

 GETTING BUY-IN FOR DESIGN-LED PROJECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design ideas often stall without traction, but strategic advocacy can
change that. Starting small, gathering input, and securing buy-in
progressively can be effective approaches. Pitches should be tailored
to audience priorities, balancing emotional storytelling with
data-driven arguments. If timing or priorities misalign, adapting and
persisting is crucial. Success hinges on framing designs effectively
to align with organizational goals. 

 MASTERING THE ART OF PROJECT PRESENTATIONS (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mastering project presentations involves clear communication,
structured content, and engaging visuals. The presentation's structure
should be defined, including relevant data points, and it is essential
to deliver it confidently. Visuals like mind maps and flowcharts can
be used to captivate the audience. Tools like Mural offer templates
for kickoffs, workflows, and more, streamlining presentation creation
and improving stakeholder alignment and engagement.
