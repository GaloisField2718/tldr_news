focused, logical steps. Each step collects specific details: personal
information, work experience, skills, and a review before submission.
Navigation involves validation at every step to prevent errors and
ensure users understand the corrections needed. This approach
streamlines complex processes like job applications, enhancing
usability and efficiency.

SUCCESS (9 MINUTE READ) [8]

Evangelist, Researcher, Innovator, Strategist, and Subject Matter
Expert. These roles emphasize unique leadership styles, blending
skills like foresight, collaboration, and specialization. Success
involves building visibility, collaborating cross-functionally, and
measuring impact. Self-assessment helps designers identify strengths
and improve weak areas, shaping distinct career paths. 

 ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER FIGMA PRICING UPDATE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figma will introduce a new seat-based pricing model on March 11,

criticism from the design community for forcing payment for features
some users may not need.
