 PENTAGRAM REBRANDS SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pentagram redesigned Scientific American's masthead - it retained the
basic construction of the former logo but is now more space-efficient.
Lower contrast between thick and thin strokes provided a bolder mark.
Pentagram also updated Scientific American's print edition to improve
its readability.

 THIS APPLE VISION PRO APP IS ALREADY CHANGING FASHION DESIGN.
HERE‚ÄôS HOW (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Swatchbook, a materials marketplace platform, is releasing Remix for
Apple Vision Pro to reduce the time-consuming process involved in
fashion design drastically. Fashion designers can see their designs in
life-size and even walk around them as if they were floating in space.
Designers can then select any element of their garment to replace with
another material or color to see how it looks without waiting weeks or
months for a physical sample.

 DESIGN DILEMMA: BALANCING AESTHETICS AND FUNCTIONALITY (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Ideally, aesthetics and functionality merge seamlessly in digital
design, but that isn‚Äôt always the case. Whether a project focuses on
aesthetics or functionality, the designer‚Äôs ultimate goal should
always be to create a positive and meaningful experience for the user.


 CREATING PORTFOLIO PIECES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers shouldn‚Äôt treat their portfolios as an archive of their
work, but as a pitch or a proposal. They should avoid deciding which
work to showcase in their portfolio when they‚Äôre desperately looking
for a job because these decisions are made under duress. Instead, they
should focus on the pieces of work that will make them stand out. 

 THE FUTURE OF DESIGN? USING AI TO ENHANCE HUMAN COGNITION AND
CREATIVITY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Metacognition is the process of thinking about one's thought
processes. This is a crucial skill for designers as it enables them to
evaluate their designs critically, identify knowledge gaps, and adapt
their creative approaches. Cornell University's "Multi-Self" tool
provides real-time biofeedback on designers' emotional states based on
their neural data. Externalizing this typically internal information
should lead to valuable self-reflection and expanded creative
exploration.
