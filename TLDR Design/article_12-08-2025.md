MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is pursuing Jony Ive's vision of an iPhone that looks like a
single slab of glass. The company has filed a new patent describing a
six-sided glass enclosure that displays content and can detect touch

 DESIGN SYSTEM TEAMS ARE DYING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Companies fall into different categories based on whether their
design systems serve products or vice versa, affecting shipping speed.
AI will eliminate traditional design system teams within two years by
automating consistency and maintenance tasks. Successful companies
embed system expertise directly into product teams while using AI to
maintain brand and quality standards. 

 THE DUOLINGO METHOD: COLLABORATION AS A CORE PRACTICE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Duolingo's Math team abandoned traditional design-to-engineering
handoffs in favor of collaborative co-creation throughout the product
development process. The team ideates together in shared files, builds
rapid prototypes, and iterates constantly using a "show don't tell"
philosophy. This collaborative approach enables faster
decision-making, maintains quality standards, and builds trust while
developing entirely new educational games and modules. 

 I'VE DESIGNED AI ASSISTANTS — HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Effective AI assistant design requires understanding users' specific
jobs-to-be-done rather than creating generic ChatGPT clones. Success
depends on building reusable UI components like context-aware prompts,
visual activity indicators, and structured response blocks. Trust
emerges through transparency about AI capabilities, designing for
unpredictable responses, and maintaining user control over automated
actions.

 SET THE STANDARD: WHY EVERY UX TEAM NEEDS DESIGN PRINCIPLES (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 UX teams lack the policies other departments have, but design
principles can provide essential high-level guidelines for consistent
decisions. Creating effective principles requires stakeholder
involvement through a four-step process: inspiration gathering,
voting, narrowing down, and active promotion. Design principles help
teams make faster decisions and serve as the foundation for broader UX
policy development.
