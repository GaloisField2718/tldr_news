NEWS & TRENDS

 USER GROUPS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN FIGMA (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 User groups in Figma enable bulk sharing of files, projects, and
teams, with automatic access granted to all current and future group
members. Content can be shared directly through the share modal,
streamlining permission management across multiple resources. Groups
can also be mentioned in comments and FigJam using @Group name to
notify all members simultaneously. 

 IBM INVESTS IN GENERATIVE AI APP DESIGN STARTUP ANIMA (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 IBM invested in generative AI startup Anima, which specializes in
"design-to-code" technology that converts UI designs into functional
code using AI. Anima's platform integrates with design tools like
Figma and Adobe XD to automatically generate frontend code, helping
bridge the gap between designers and developers in the "vibe coding"
trend. The investment will help Anima expand its enterprise
integrations. The company is already working with major clients like
Samsung, Amazon, and Apple to accelerate design projects by up to 50%.


 GALAXY S26 AND S26 PLUS COLORS REVEALED IN CLEAN RENDERS (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A new leak from Evan Blass reveals that Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S26
and S26 Plus will launch in four finishes—Black, White, Blue, and
Cobalt Violet—with matching frames and a refined but largely
unchanged design, keeping both models visually aligned. Rather than a
dramatic exterior overhaul, Samsung appears to be focusing on
AI-driven software enhancements as the main selling point, meaning
buyers will likely choose between the two based on size, battery, and
chip differences rather than color or design.

 USEFUL GUIDELINES AND CALCULATORS FOR UX RESEARCH (11 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 UX research should challenge assumptions and reduce risk rather than
validate pre-made decisions. Start with small sample sizes (5
interviews per segment) to identify critical issues before scaling up.
Effective research requires clear goals first, then appropriate
questions, methods, and sample sizes, while triangulating both
quantitative behavioral data and qualitative motivational insights. 

 DESIGN IS DEAD, IT'S ALL EVOLUTION NOW (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Traditional product design with intentional structure and hierarchy
has been replaced by evolutionary development, where teams make
hundreds of random changes and keep only the successful ones.
Instagram exemplifies this shift, evolving from a simple photo
timeline into a chaotic mix of features like Stories, Reels, and IGTV
that lack logical organization. This approach eliminates the need for
human designers since the process mirrors natural evolution, where
variants are generated variants and survivors are selected without
conscious planning. 

 THE ART OF THE FLOP: WHY DESIGN NEEDS THE COURAGE TO FAIL (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The Museum of Failure debuted in the UK at Packaging Innovations &
Empack 2026, showcasing infamous flops like the Tetra Pak Rigello
bottle and the noisy Sun Chips compostable bag to highlight how
“good” failure—experimentation that pushes boundaries—drives
innovation. Founder Samuel West and collaborator Ricardo Campos argue
that industries must foster psychological safety, avoid groupthink,
and critically manage AI use to prevent costly overconfidence,
emphasizing that smart experimentation and learning from mistakes are
essential to real progress.

 HOW AI LITERACY SHAPES GENAI SSE (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI literacy involves two distinct skills: prompt fluency (the ability
to communicate effectively with AI) and output literacy (the ability
to evaluate and verify AI responses). Research identified four user
types based on these skills: AI novices (low in both), naive power
users (good at prompting but poor at evaluation), skeptical abstainers
(good at evaluation but avoid using AI), and AI experts (strong in
both areas). Understanding these different literacy levels is crucial
for designing inclusive AI experiences that support users across all
skill levels. 

 APPLE CREATOR STUDIO AI USAGE LIMITS SEEM DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN
PROMISED (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Developer Steve Troughton-Smith found that creating a single
AI-generated Keynote presentation consumed 47% of his monthly Apple
Creator Studio limit—far from the “50 presentations per month”
Apple suggested—meaning he could realistically make only two, while
building an entire app with Xcode's Codex used just 7% of his weekly
allowance. The stark contrast, also highlighted by John Gruber, raises
questions about how Apple calculates AI usage across tools and whether
the advertised limits reflect real-world use. 

 FIGMA VARIABLES STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Figma variables are good at storing values, but fail to show how
those values relate to each other or are derived from base values.
Most design systems use a few base values that are modified across
different states, but Figma variables don't support this composition
model. This post proposes a lightweight CMS-like system within Figma
that would allow variables to reference shared structures and
automatically generate predictable token sets with proper error
handling.

 WHY YOUR BRAIN REBELS AGAINST REDESIGNS — EVEN GOOD ONES (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Major redesigns trigger user backlash because they disrupt the
brain's ability to perform familiar tasks without conscious thought,
forcing users to revert to effortful, deliberate thinking that feels
exhausting.
