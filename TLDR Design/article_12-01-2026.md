 PENPOT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH MCP SERVERS FOR AI-POWERED DESIGN
WORKFLOWS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Penpot is experimenting with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
that enable AI assistants like Claude to understand and interact with
Penpot design files through secure API requests without exposing user
data to the AI. These servers leverage Penpot's
design-expressed-as-code approach to enable workflows such as
converting designs to code and back, generating documentation,
validating consistency, and performing operations via natural language
commands. Penpot is seeking beta testers to help refine the MCP server
capabilities and explore additional use cases for AI-powered design
workflows. 

 MYSTERY AI LAB THAT POACHED IPHONE AIR DESIGNER REVEALED (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Former Apple industrial designer Abidur Chowdhury has joined a new AI
startup called Hark. Founded by Brett Adcock and funded with $100M of
his own money, Hark is quickly hiring engineers from companies like
Google, Meta, and Amazon to build “human-centric” AI, though its
exact product remains unclear. Most AI hardware efforts have struggled
to gain traction, aside from Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. OpenAI has
hinted at future AI hardware without yet revealing what it will be. 

 TAILWIND LABS LAYS OFF 75 PERCENT OF ITS ENGINEERS THANKS TO
‘BRUTAL IMPACT' OF AI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tailwind Labs laid off 75 percent of its engineering team after AI
tools caused an 80 percent drop in revenue, despite growing usage of
its popular CSS framework. AI agents answering developer questions
reduced website traffic by 40 percent, preventing the discovery of the
commercial component packages that sustain the business. Following the
announcement, major tech companies, including Vercel and Google's AI
Studio team, pledged sponsorships to support the open-source project.

 THE FORMULA THAT CHANGED HOW I THINK ABOUT DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Design fundamentally shapes behavior by understanding users deeply
while controlling their environment through interface choices.
Designers have two levers: researching who users actually are, and
crafting every environmental detail from button placement to word
choice that interacts with users to produce desired behaviors. Social
platforms uniquely complicate this model because users become each
other's environment, creating emergent behaviors that designers can
only indirectly influence through algorithms and guidelines. 

 AS AI TAKES HOLD, DESIGNERS SHOULD PRIORITISE TECH'S OFF SWITCH (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers must now prioritize giving users frictionless control over
when technology is active, as consumer fatigue with omnipresent AI
grows. Four trends signal this shift: backlash against vague
"AI-powered" marketing, demand for clear opt-outs and agency over AI
features, sustainability concerns around AI's environmental costs
becoming central, and preference for AI that enhances rather than
replaces human creativity. "Tech for tech's sake" will decline in 2026
as emotional intention and purposeful design reclaim priority over
indiscriminate technology integration. 

 WHEN YOUR BEST WORK GETS TOSSED (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design gets sidelined, not because it lacks value, but because the
profession never learned to explain its impact in business terms,
leaving decisions driven by opinion instead of evidence. To survive
and lead, designers must translate user and craft outcomes into
revenue, cost, and risk language, while education, organizations, and
the industry build systems that make design's business value visible
and undeniable.
