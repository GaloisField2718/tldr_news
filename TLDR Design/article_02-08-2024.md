 GOOGLE PRESENTS NEW UPDATE FOR GOOGLE MAPS AND WAZE (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Google has updated Google Maps and Waze, adding improved user
interface elements to make it easier for users to find their
destinations and be aware of traffic situations. Google Maps now
includes a report button for users to send reports about road issues

READ) [6] 

 Researchers at Imperial College London have developed "copyright
traps" to help creators detect if AI models have used their work
without permission. These traps are hidden within copyrighted content
and can indicate if the content is later found in AI-generated
outputs. While not foolproof, this method offers a new way to address
the growing concern of AI scraping copyrighted material.

design elements across federal websites and enhance usability and
accessibility.
