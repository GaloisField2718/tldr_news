 'HELP ME CREATE' IN GOOGLE VIDS NOW INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR GOOGLE
SLIDES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google Vids' "Help me create" feature now supports Google Slides as
reference material for AI-powered video creation. Users can
incorporate slides, images, and text from presentations into video
drafts by referencing them with the "@" symbol in prompts. The gradual
rollout began on September 2 for most Google Workspace plans and
Gemini subscribers. 

 LIVE PHOTOS ARE COMING TO WHATSAPP (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 WhatsApp's latest beta updates now allow motion photos on Android and
full Live Photo support on iOS, letting users share images with both
movement and audio intact. Cross-platform compatibility ensures
Android users see them as motion photos and iOS users as Live Photos,
while users retain the option to send them as static images. The
feature is currently rolling out gradually to selected testers.

 PRODUCT TRIOS ARE COLLAPSING. HERE'S HOW DESIGNERS CAN SMOOTH THEM
OVER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Product trios are increasingly dysfunctional, with designers often
supporting multiple PMs or engineers due to resource constraints and
unclear design value. Designers can repair these imbalanced teams by
becoming strategic translators who bridge gaps between metrics-focused
PMs and feasibility-focused engineers, framing design requests through
business impact using techniques like "so I can" statements. They
should also position themselves as risk reducers by validating user
desirability before costly development begins, and understand
teammates' individual motivators to craft more compelling arguments
for design's strategic value. 

 THE CASCADE EFFECT IN CONTEXT-BASED DESIGN SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Context-based design systems cascade structured meaning and intent
through each workflow layer, not just visual values like traditional
systems. When design decisions carry context about purpose and
reasoning, each downstream phase becomes more intelligent and capable
of making correct decisions. This cascading approach enables
AI-powered tools and non-developers to participate meaningfully in
creation while maintaining system integrity through inherited context.


 WHAT DIGITAL UX CAN LEARN FROM THE PHYSICAL MEDIA REVIVAL (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 UX designers can learn from physical media to make digital streaming
more human and satisfying by reducing choice, adding constraints,
limiting personalization, increasing customization and curation, and
even offering retro emulations. While digital convenience dominates,
reflecting on the tactile, deliberate, and curated experience of
physical formats can improve engagement and user satisfaction without
fully abandoning streaming's speed and flexibility.

 FIGMA: HOW TO OPT OUT OF AI FEATURES? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Figma automatically enrolled all users except enterprise customers
into AI training using their design files without notification or
consent, sparking widespread backlash from the design community. The
company employs dark patterns by burying the opt-out setting deep
within team settings rather than easily accessible account
preferences. This incident reflects a broader industry trend where
companies prioritize data collection over user consent, following
similar controversies like Adobe's recent AI training policies. 

 CREATIVES SHARE TRICKS FOR TAMING IMPOSTER SYNDROME THAT ACTUALLY
WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Imposter syndrome is common among creatives at all levels, but it can
be managed through a mix of practical strategies, community support,
and mindset shifts. Techniques include documenting achievements,
naming your inner critic, starting projects with small actions,
focusing on facts or checklists, practicing self-compassion, and
remembering that everyone experiences doubt. Acknowledging these
feelings and sharing strategies helps reduce their power.
