NEWS & TRENDS

 TINDER REPLACES WORDMARK WITH PINK AND ORANGE FLAME LOGO (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Tinder has redesigned its logo, replacing the text-based wordmark
with a standalone, gradient flame icon that fades from pink to orange
to signal a shift toward a more visually driven brand identity
reminiscent of Instagram's 2016 update. This change accompanied a
broader app overhaul focused on a cleaner aesthetic, faster image
navigation, and simplified profile interaction, reflecting ongoing
trends in flat yet expressive design. 

 GOOGLE MAPS UPDATED WITH NEW BOTTOM CORNER LOGO (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Maps updated the logo that appeared in the bottom-left corner
of its mobile app, replacing the multi-color 'Google' logo with a more
minimal 'Google Maps' wordmark in black or white, depending on device
theme. This change aligns the branding with other Google products and
aims to be less visually distracting, especially in full-screen map
views. The update rolled out on Android and iOS, but it has not yet
appeared on the desktop web version. 

 ODYSSEY'S NEW AI MODEL STREAMS 3D INTERACTIVE WORLDS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Odyssey unveiled an AI model that generates interactive 3D video
worlds in real-time. The system streams new video frames every 40
milliseconds, allowing users to explore environments like a video game
through basic controls. The model can maintain coherent video streams
for over five minutes, though current demos show blurry, unstable
environments that sometimes change unexpectedly.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AI MAKES BAD MANAGERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Relying on AI, such as ChatGPT, to write performance reviews may seem
efficient, but it deprives managers of the essential yet problematic
practice needed to develop core leadership skills, including empathy,
feedback, and judgment. While AI can assist with repetitive or
structured tasks, using it for nuanced, human-centered
responsibilities, such as performance management, undermines long-term
growth and effectiveness as a leader. 

 THE BONES OF UX (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unstructured design often leads to confusion, misalignment, and
wasted effort, like muscles trying to flex without bones. Teams can
create a shared structural foundation that empowers faster, clearer,
and more collaborative design by embracing Object Oriented UX (OOUX),
turning creative energy into focused, impactful results. 

 NO, AI WILL NOT REPLACE YOU (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI will not replace designers despite common fears about job
displacement. AI tools can hallucinate 10-20% of the time and often
experience product-market fit collapse. They amplify the need for four
human qualities: authenticity, curation, critical thinking, and
strategy. The shift moves designers away from tactical pixel-pushing
toward more strategic roles in shaping project vision and
orchestrating user experiences.

 SAINT URBAIN'S BRAND FOR HOTEL NOW NOW HAS “SOUL AND STORY”
BEHIND IT (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Saint Urbain developed a modular, emotionally rich brand identity for
Now Now, a new hotel in New York's NoHo that caters to introspective,
experience-seeking young travelers with the tagline “Be Where You
Belong.” The branding combines a flexible wordmark, expressive
typography, and mood-driven gradients to evoke warmth, motion, and a
sense of belonging, reflecting the hotel's mission to offer a modern,
community-oriented lodging experience. 

 4 STEPS TOWARD A PRODUCT DESIGN OFFER (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Landing a design role successfully relies on three key factors: a
concise and impactful resume, a well-organized and relevant portfolio,
and a friendly and open attitude. A structured approach—defining
personal priorities, targeting suitable companies, preparing
thoroughly for interviews, and maintaining clear communication—can
significantly shorten the job search and improve outcomes. 

 READY OR NOT, THE EAA IS HERE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The European Accessibility Act (EAA), which takes effect on June 28,
will require all digital products and services accessible in the EU,
including those from non-EU businesses, to comply with the WCAG 2.1,
Level AA accessibility standards. This marks a shift from
public-sector-only requirements to include private sectors, such as
e-commerce and banking, making accessibility a legal necessity rather
than just a design best practice.
