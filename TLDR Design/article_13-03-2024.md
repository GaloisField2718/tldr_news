MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Several outlets have published alleged CAD-based renderings of the
iPhone 16 in the past few weeks. According to the leaks, the camera
island on the new phone may get a pill-shaped makeover. The only
visible change on the iPhone 16 Pro is an extra button on the right
edge beneath the power button. It won't be a physical button and may
act as a camera shutter button. It may also be customizable.

 NEW DECATHLON REBRAND FEELS PLAYFUL YET FAMILIAR (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Developed by brand consultancy Wolff Olins, Decathlon's rebrand aims
to transform the sports giant into a "future-fit" sports brand. As
part of the new positioning, the company now focuses on a sense of
play and enjoyment through sports. This rebrand retains the
interconnected 'C' and 'A' but introduces a darker blue and a new
brand icon. The Decathlon Sans typeface has also changed with looser
kerning, making it more legible than before.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 UX, STOP BELIEVING THE GASLIGHTERS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UX is diluted, minimized, and disempowered. However, we‚Äôre
gaslighted into believing it‚Äôs our fault, which adds to our
disempowerment. Designers have little or no power to do the job
description they were hired to do. However, they‚Äôre gaslighted and
told it‚Äôs their fault. 

 NAVIGATING THE DESIGNOPS WILDERNESS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design Operations (DesignOps) aims to address pain points and
cross-functional gaps in a UX org through a lay-of-the-land assessment
and a focused roadmap. To create such a roadmap, designers need to
synthesize all past learnings, identify and prioritize initiatives
with OKRs, create the roadmap, and socialize it by catering to the
audience. Start small and build trust. 

 THE EXTREMES INFORM THE MEAN (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Exploring the extremes is an excellent way to find ideas that
transform the status quo and improve user experience. It can also
unlock innovation and creativity, resulting in breakthroughs. The best
way to embrace extremes is to let go of what's familiar and
comfortable, embrace constraints, and be open to vulnerability.

 INSTAGRAM‚ÄôS NEW MOTION SYSTEM MIMICS NATURAL HUMAN MOVEMENT (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Instagram has revamped its app's motion design to add a more human
and imperfect touch to its brand. Inspired by natural human
interactions like tapping and scrolling, this comprehensive motion
system, created by Studio Dumbar/Dept, was guided by design rules that
embrace imperfection, incorporate techniques that mimic accurate
camera movements, and integrate the creators' experience. 

 THE REBALANCING OF DESIGN MANAGEMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There's a disturbing paradox in the design industry. In most
businesses, design managers have been explicitly trained to avoid
getting involved beyond people and operations. On the other hand, many
designers follow industry standards too much and need help thinking
outside the box. Management needs to drive business outcomes actively
and designers must create work that solves user problems and
differentiates your product from the competition. Otherwise, all the
people-oriented work will not matter since the product will only last
for a while. 

 APPLE VS. ANDROID DESIGN: HOW THEIR DESIGN PHILOSOPHIES INFLUENCE THE
PAST AND PRESENT (5 MINUTE READ) [15]

designs over the years. It reveals the UX philosophies that underpin
their design choices and offers vital lessons for crafting products
that resonate. Android values flexibility, adapting to user
preferences while maintaining a cohesive user experience through
collaboration with device manufacturers, unlike Apple, who emphasizes
rigorous market research, extensive user feedback, and highly
emotional and practical products.
