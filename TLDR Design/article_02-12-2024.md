 THOM BROWNE WINS IN ADIDAS TRADEMARK BATTLE OVER STRIPE PATTERN (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A U.K. court ruled against Adidas in its case against Thom Browne,
affirming the legality of Thom Browne's four-bar stripe design. This
decision and a similar U.S. ruling highlight the challenges of
"trademark bullying," where dominant companies target smaller rivals.
The verdict strengthens protections for designers and underscores the
consequences of overreaching trademark claims.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DOING THE NUMBERS: DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY AND SHIFTING LEFT (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Companies are increasingly prioritizing digital accessibility,
benefiting users and businesses alike. However, many reactively
address accessibility, incurring high costs. Adopting a "shift-left"
approach and integrating accessibility early in development reduces
expenses significantly. Automated tools and robust processes, like
defect capture and configuration management, enhance efficiency and
prevent recurring issues, delivering substantial financial and
usability gains. 

 HOW TO HELP YOUR TEAM NAVIGATE PRODUCT DISCOVERY AND WORK WITH
EXECUTIVES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product Discovery is crucial for designers to clarify ambiguity and
frame problems effectively. Asking 'why', 'what don't I know', and
'who I can talk to' helps align user needs, business goals, and
technical feasibility. Proactively engaging during kickoff meetings
fosters collaboration, saves time, and enhances design outcomes while
showcasing the value of design thinking. 

 CREATIVITY IS THE ONLY THING (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Creativity, a fundamental force for good, is being increasingly
marginalized in favor of data-driven systems that suppress
individuality and humanity. AGI challenges the value of human workers.
Adapting to change to navigate an uncertain future may require
abandoning conformist paradigms and embracing creativity.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AVOID READ-ONLY CONTROLS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Read-only form controls often confuse users and lack clear visual
cues. HTML and ARIA implementations differ widely, with inconsistent
screen reader support. Styling requires custom solutions - some
browsers treat read-only inputs like disabled ones. While
theoretically functional, read-only controls can create usability
challenges, making them less practical for many applications.
