OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 A CRISIS OF MEANING IN UX DESIGN (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The UX design industry is facing a crisis, as designers feel
undervalued, burnt out, and threatened by AI, while companies
prioritize financial growth over user needs. Once seen as innovators
and user advocates, designers now struggle with a shift from
meaningful impact to mere optimization, signaling the decline of
design as a transformative force. 

 DESIGNERS HAVE A SEAT AT THE TOP TABLE – SO WHAT NOW? (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Designers have shifted from focusing solely on aesthetics to
influencing business strategy, shaping conversations, and solving
problems at a systems level. With their expanding role in strategy and
decision-making, the question is how they will use this new influence.


 THE EXISTENTIAL CHALLENGE OF DESIGN SYSTEM TEAM MORALE (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Design system teams face burnout, reactivity, and uncertainty amid
industry layoffs and shifting priorities. Morale depends on
discipline, focus, and patience, creating structure, avoiding
distractions, and fostering stability. Design systems thrive on
predictability, reducing chaos in an ever-changing world. Strong
processes, clear goals, and saying “no” strategically help
maintain effectiveness and morale.

 DESIGN AWARDS MUST EVOLVE, OR THEY WILL HOLD THE INDUSTRY BACK (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Creative awards shape industry standards but struggle to keep pace
with rapid change. They validate achievements yet risk reinforcing
outdated norms. Balancing influence, innovation, and credibility
remains crucial. Awards must evolve beyond monolithic judgment to
reflect a diverse, fast-moving landscape while maintaining meaningful
benchmarks that guide creative excellence without distorting progress.


 UNDERSTANDING PRIORITY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 UX designers often prioritize usability issues without considering
broader team constraints. Product teams consider factors like reach,
resources, and impact. Understanding prioritization models, such as
the RICE framework, helps designers communicate effectively and align
recommendations with business goals, improving their transition from
UX to Product Design.
