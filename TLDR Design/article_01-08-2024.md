 DESIGNING DESIGN SYSTEMS: CONSTRUCTING AN ICON SYSTEM (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Creating a unified icon system involves designing consistent and
cohesive visual elements that enhance user interaction and brand
recognition. Adobe's Spectrum team developed a three-phase process,
focusing on design exploration, beta testing, and finalizing details
before production. This approach ensures icons are adaptable,
customizable, and optimized for various applications, strengthening
the brand experience across a product portfolio while maintaining
consistency and clarity. 

 WHY NOT ALL VOICES SHOULD BE EQUAL IN THE DESIGN PROCESS (17 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Not all voices should be equal in the design process. Those deeply
impacted by the issues should be centered. This approach ensures that
the most marginalized communities are heard and their needs
prioritized, leading to more equitable and effective solutions.
Traditional design often overlooks this, but by focusing on those with
lived experiences, social change can be more meaningful and inclusive.

 THE SHAPE OF SENTIENT DESIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The concept of Sentient Design explores AI-driven interfaces that are
context-aware and radically adaptive, shaping new user experiences.
These experiences are mapped through a framework that categorizes AI
interactions as grounded, interoperable, or adaptive, leading to
archetypes like tools, copilots, agents, and chat interfaces. This
framework helps designers navigate the evolving landscape of
AI-mediated experiences, fostering better understanding and innovation
in user interface design.
