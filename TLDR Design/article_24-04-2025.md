 “BRAVERY PAYS” – HOW AND WHY DESIGNERS SHOULD PURSUE BOLDER
CREATIVE IDEAS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many designers play it safe to meet conservative client expectations,
yet research shows clients often want bold and provocative ideas. This
tension comes from a risk-averse, metric-driven culture that sometimes
values process over imagination. However, there's growing recognition
that brave, strategic creativity builds stronger brand connections and
long-term relevance, especially in an AI-driven world. 

 PRACTICAL WAYS I USE AI IN DESIGN (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI is increasingly being used to gain deeper customer insights and
enhance content creation. It boosts efficiency by synthesizing
interviews and organizing event data, leading to more informed design
decisions and richer user experiences. It also aids in brainstorming,
strengthens copywriting, and speeds up research, ultimately freeing up
time for more thoughtful, human-centered work. 

 DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE AGILE METHODOLOGY IN UX DESIGN (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Agile improves speed and collaboration but often sidelines UX due to
time constraints, fragmented workflows, and poor communication.
Balancing short sprints with long-term UX goals requires dual-track
workflows, lean UX practices, and team alignment through workshops,
smart metrics, and rapid testing, which ensures usability and user
needs remain a priority.

 MOUNTAIN MEETS MOTHERBOARD IN MULTIVERSE STUDIO'S NATURE-TECH
IDENTITY FOR SOFTWARE COMPANY MAIELLA (3 MINUTE READ) [13]

company Maiella, merging digital innovation with nature and

 CRAFTING BALLPARK'S FUN LOGO DESIGN AND BRANDING (3 MINUTE READ) [14]

that blends handcrafted charm with polish, reflecting the tool's focus
on fun, fast, effective feedback. 

 RETHINKING BAD DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Good design is often overlooked due to poor education, bias, and
profit-driven motives. Despite decades of research, such as Fitts's
Law, tech still prioritizes function over usability, leading to
harmful outcomes. Shifting focus from sales to real-world use—and
valuing design expertise early—can enhance how people experience
technology in their daily lives.
