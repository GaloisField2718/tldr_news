NEWS & TRENDS

 LEAKED GALAXY S26 IMAGES GIVE YOU AN EARLY LOOK AT THE SUBTLE DESIGN
CHANGES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S26 lineup features a redesigned vertical,
pill-shaped camera island with three sensors. The S26 Ultra includes
two additional sensors and a flash module. It also has rounder corners
and a repositioned S Pen slot for improved ergonomics, though overall
design changes remain subtle. Expected internal upgrades include new
processors from Qualcomm or Samsung's Exynos 2600, as well as camera
and software improvements. 

 APPLE REDUCES VISION PRO PRODUCTION AFTER WEAK SALES (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Apple has sharply cut Vision Pro production after weak sales (around
4,500 units shipped in a recent quarter). Rather than abandoning
spatial computing, Apple appears to be regrouping—reducing costs,
pausing marketing, and shifting focus toward lighter smart glasses and
practical enterprise use cases where everyday value is clearer. 

 INSTAGRAM CEO THINKS REAL CONTENT SHOULD BE LABELED (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri believes that, as AI becomes increasingly
challenging to detect, platforms should focus on labeling authentic
content rather than identifying AI-generated material. He proposes
that camera manufacturers cryptographically sign images at capture to
create a verifiable "chain of custody" for real media. This
fingerprinting approach would prove more practical than attempting to
identify fake content as AI technology advances.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ESCAPING AI SLUDGE: WHY MVPS SHOULD BE DELIGHTFUL (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 AI-generated content has created a sea of generic, homogeneous
products lacking human character, making it essential that MVPs
incorporate delight and emotional design from the start. Products
cannot be commercially viable without a strong brand voice and
delightful experiences that meet users' psychological needs. Teams
should view delight as foundational to viability, embedding it
throughout development rather than deferring personality until after
launch. 

 TRUTH AND CERTAINTY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design that chases certainty produces alignment, efficiency, and
compliance, but at the cost of inquiry, experimentation, and
individual judgment. Faith, by contrast, resembles good design
practice—living with ambiguity, testing assumptions, and staying
open to revision—because it treats uncertainty not as a failure to
eliminate, but as the raw material for meaningful creation. 

 THE ONE DESIGN TREND I WANT TO SEE MORE OF IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Recent film posters, from the raw, hand-drawn romance of Wuthering
Heights to the bold energy of Ballad of a Small Player and the
maximalist flourish of del Toro's Frankenstein, stand out by rejecting
safe, algorithm-driven design in favor of expressive typography that
creates immediate emotional impact. This shift toward risk, texture,
and strong visual voice feels refreshing in a culture dulled by
sameness, pointing to a wider desire for design that sparks joy,
curiosity, and genuine connection.

 15 PROVEN UX PATTERNS THAT INCREASE TRUST AND CREDIBILITY (16 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 You must build trust and credibility as soon as possible, as users
judge websites within 50 milliseconds. Key patterns include clear
navigation, visual consistency, authentic social proof, security
indicators, transparent pricing, accessibility features, and
performance speed to reduce user skepticism. These evidence-based
design solutions address common problems like confusion, hesitation,
and doubt by signaling professionalism, safety, and user-centricity
through psychological principles and tested approaches. 

 A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE ON MINIMAL DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Minimal design aligns with cognitive limitations identified by
scientific research, including restricted short-term memory,
inattentional blindness to excessive stimuli, and the Gestalt
principle. The brain processes information primarily through
automated, subconscious mechanisms that respond better to simplified,
immediate visual communication rather than complex interfaces. While
minimal design proves highly effective for novice users by reducing
cognitive load and enabling instant comprehension, it may fall short
for expert users who require richer information density and can
process complexity within their domains. 

 UNKOVER IDENTITY BY MORILLAS PUTS PEOPLE AT THE CENTER OF VOCATIONAL
GUIDANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Unkover's Vocational Guidance axis has outgrown the Zing program,
creating confusion and prompting the need for an independent brand and
visual identity that reflects its expanded scope and audience. The new
identity centers on the idea of “highlighting” people and their
purposes—expressed through the tagline “Descobrim
propòsits”—using a graphic system and logo built around
parentheses as a visual embrace that emphasizes individuality,
connection, and empowerment.
