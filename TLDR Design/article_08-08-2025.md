 CHARACTER.AI LAUNCHES WORLD'S FIRST AI-NATIVE SOCIAL FEED (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Character.AI's Feed is the world's first AI-native social platform
featuring scrollable content with Characters, Scenes, and Streams. The
platform transforms passive consumption into interactive creation,
allowing users to remix storylines and build on others' content. Feed
is rolling out on the mobile app with multimodal features including
Chat Snippets, Character Cards, and Avatar FX video creation. 

 INSTAGRAM LAUNCHES REPOSTS AND COPIES SNAP MAPS IDEA (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Meta is adding Instagram Map and post reposting to make Instagram
more social and focused on real connections, shifting away from its
video-heavy, algorithm-driven feed. While Instagram Map shares user
location only with consent and limited updates, and post reposting
boosts friends' content in the main feed, some users have raised
privacy concerns, despite Meta's emphasis on user control. 

 TINDER EXPLORES A REDESIGN, DATING ‘MODES,' AND COLLEGE-SPECIFIC
FEATURES TO BOOST ENGAGEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tinder faces declining user engagement with a 7% drop in paying
users, prompting the company to introduce new features, including
"modes" for different dating goals and college-specific options. The
dating app is planning a broader redesign targeting Gen Z users that
will feature AI-powered matching expansion and allow users to like
specific profile parts. Despite flat revenue of $864 million in Q2,
Match Group expects improved Q3 performance and announced $50 million
in product development investments.

 DIGITAL TWINS: SIMULATING HUMANS WITH GENERATIVE AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Digital twins are generative AI models that simulate specific
individuals to predict their preferences and behaviors in new
situations. These AI proxies can fill survey gaps, enable shorter
studies, and forecast population trends by aggregating individual
predictions. While showing promise for research efficiency, digital
twins raise significant ethical concerns about consent, privacy, and
misrepresentation. 

 UX DESIGNER SKILLS: WHAT HIRING MANAGERS ACTUALLY LOOK FOR IN 2025 (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX hiring managers in 2025 prioritize strategic thinking and
problem-solving over polished interfaces and tool proficiency.
Essential skills include user research, data analysis, AI literacy,
accessibility knowledge, and strong collaboration abilities.
Portfolios should demonstrate real impact through case studies with
clear decision-making processes and measurable outcomes. 

 THIS MACOS 26 ICON STRATEGY PUNISHES MAC USERS MORE THAN DEVELOPERS
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 macOS 26 has sparked backlash over design changes, particularly the
revised Finder and Macintosh HD icons, with users criticizing
inconsistencies in perspective, added visual clutter, and a lack of
clarity. Apple's new layered glass icon style and enforcement of a
uniform squircle shape—often resulting in blurry visuals and “gray
box” placeholders for non-conforming third-party apps—has led to
usability concerns and a perception that the Mac is becoming harder to
navigate.

 DO LLMS IDENTIFY FONTS? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A developer created a live benchmark using font identification
requests from the dafont.com forum to evaluate how well LLMs like
GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.5 can recognize fonts in previously unseen
images. Despite a clever setup to avoid benchmark contamination, the
models performed poorly, showing how LLMs still struggle with certain
real-world visual classification tasks.
