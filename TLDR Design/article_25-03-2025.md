 GEMINI APP REDESIGNS ‘PLUS' MENU, ADDS CANVAS AND AUDIO OVERVIEWS
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Gemini app just got a big update on both Android and iOS, with a
redesigned 'plus' menu that makes it easier to access tools like the
camera, gallery, and files. They've also added Canvas, where you can
create documents and code right in the app, and Audio Overviews, which
turn documents into podcast-style summaries. These new features are
designed to make the app more useful and interactive, especially for
people who want to dive deeper into their content. 

 XAI LAUNCHES AN API FOR GENERATING IMAGES (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The "grok-2-image-1212" model adds image generation to xAI's API. xAI
charges $0.07 per image, while competing providers charge
$0.05–$0.08. The new capability lacks customization options, and
prompts in requests are subject to revision by a "chat model." xAI is
seeking revenue and funding while expanding its AI capabilities,
including generative video, and data infrastructure. 

 APPLE GETS THE GREEN LIGHT TO DESIGN THE IPHONE OF ITS DREAMS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A portless iPhone may soon be released, as EU regulations allow
devices without charging ports. The rumored iPhone 17 Air, possibly
Apple's thinnest yet, was initially designed without a charging port
or SIM slot. Though Apple hasn't removed it yet, the shift toward a
fully wireless iPhone seems inevitable.

 A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR STRATEGIC THINKERS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As no-code app development and vibe coding gain traction, the focus
is shifting from "how" to "what" to build. Skilled in identifying
valuable problems, designers become essential in framing strategic
solutions. Strategic UX research and problem framing allow teams to
innovate and avoid building irrelevant features, driving product
success. 

 WHY MOTION IS THE FUTURE OF BRAND IDENTITY, AND HOW TO DO IT RIGHT (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Motion transforms static brand identities into dynamic, engaging
experiences that foster deeper audience connections. It should be
integrated from the start, ensuring scalability, performance, and a
human touch in today's digital-first world. 

 DESIGNING FOR STRESS AND EMERGENCIES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stressful situations should be considered when designing products, as
users often face distractions and pressures. Stress impacts
decision-making, cognition, and memory. Effective design should
minimize the cognitive load by promoting single-tasking, offering
clear steps, and avoiding complexity. Testing for stress cases and
preparing emergency features can help manage user stress effectively.
