 TIKTOK INTRODUCES VOICE NOTES AND PHOTO SHARING IN DMS (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 TikTok is expanding its messaging features to let users send voice
notes up to 60 seconds and share up to nine images or videos in
one-on-one or group chats. The update includes editing options, safety
restrictions for new contacts, and protections for younger users. The
move will align TikTok more closely with platforms like WhatsApp and
Instagram. 

 PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE DESIGN PLATFORM FRAMER RAISES $100M AT $2B
VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amsterdam-based Framer has raised $100 million in Series D funding at
a $2 billion valuation led by existing investors Meritech and Atomico.
The professional website design platform empowers designers,
developers, and marketers to create production-ready websites with AI
assistance, databases, and advanced features, eliminating the need for
technical expertise. Framer has focused on enterprise customers since
launching its business plans last year, with hundreds of thousands of
active websites and clients, including Scale AI, Perplexity, and Miro.


 MINDJOURNEY ENABLES AI TO EXPLORE SIMULATED 3D WORLDS TO IMPROVE
SPATIAL INTERPRETATION (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MindJourney is a novel research framework that enables AI agents to
explore simulated 3D environments, thereby enhancing their
understanding of spatial relationships derived from 2D images. The
system utilizes a world model to generate photo-realistic views from
various perspectives, while a vision-language model filters the most
informative viewpoints using spatial beam search. Testing on the
Spatial Aptitude Training benchmark showed MindJourney improved VLM
accuracy by 8% without requiring additional training.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHERE AI IS FAILING DESIGN SYSTEMS, AND WHERE WE ARE FAILING AI (8
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A discussion with 95 design system practitioners explored how AI fits
into design systems, showing that AI is effective for divergent tasks
like brainstorming, research, and low-risk prototyping, but struggles
with convergent tasks that require precision, such as
production-quality code, design-system fidelity, and pixel-perfect
visuals. Successful integration depends on context engineering,
rigorous contract tests, and careful measurement of AI output,
treating AI as a collaborator to accelerate and propose rather than a
fully reliable producer, while keeping human judgment central. 

 AI-POWERED PROTOTYPING WITH DESIGN SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI prototyping tools typically excel at speed and collaboration but
struggle with brand consistency due to a lack of context about design
systems. Vercel's v0 can generate brand-aligned, production-ready
prototypes when paired with AI-native design systems like shadcn/ui,
which provides open components, consistent APIs, and token-based
styling that models can effectively interpret. Teams can create
scalable AI prototyping workflows by applying design tokens to
shadcn/ui themes, building reusable component blocks, and publishing
registries that enable both humans and AI models to work with the same
design system foundation. 

 CREATIVE JOB LOSSES ARE RISING – AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The creative industries are experiencing unprecedented job losses as
artificial intelligence displaces human workers, with WPP cutting
7,000 positions and tech companies eliminating over 22,000 jobs in
2025. While tech companies promote AI as "democratizing creativity,"
the reality creates homogenized, mediocre content that lacks the
unpredictable human spark that resonates with audiences.

 CURIOSITY ISN'T JUST A PERSONALITY TRAIT. IT'S A DESIGNER'S BEST
STRATEGIC TOOL (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design leaders identify curiosity as a strategic tool for breaking
silos and building relationships, not just a personality trait. The
"Benjamin Franklin Effect" illustrates how asking colleagues for
expertise-based favors can create cognitive dissonance, thereby
improving strained workplace relationships. Framing curious questions
around business impact helps designers connect their work to outcomes
and positions design as strategic rather than purely visual. 

 DESIGNING FOR TV: THE EVERGREEN PATTERN THAT SHAPES TV EXPERIENCES
(20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 TV interface design is governed by the "10-foot experience,"
requiring larger elements for distant viewing and the enduring D-pad
navigation pattern from 1980s Nintendo controllers. Despite
technological advances like touchpads and motion controls, the basic
six-button scheme (four directions plus two action buttons) remains
the universal foundation for TV interaction. This pattern persists
because it represents the optimal balance between simplicity and
functionality for remote-controlled navigation across all TV
platforms.
