 SAM ALTMAN OPEN TO ADS ON CHATGPT, CALLS INSTAGRAM ADS ‘KINDA COOL'
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed openness to advertising on ChatGPT,
calling Instagram ads "kinda cool" and stating he's "not totally
against" the concept. His stance has evolved from describing ads as a
"last resort" in 2024 to being more direct about considering how
advertisements could integrate into ChatGPT's future. Despite OpenAI's
substantial funding, which included $40 billion in March, the
company's operational costs of $3-4 billion annually may drive the
shift toward advertising revenue models. 

 ‘NOT A WEARABLE', COURT DOCUMENTS DETAIL OPENAI'S PLANS FOR ITS AI
HARDWARE PROJECT WITH JONY IVE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 New court filings from a trademark lawsuit reveal that OpenAI and
Jony Ive's hardware team, io Products, have been deeply exploring
audio tech and in-ear ergonomics, despite denying that their first
product is an in-ear or wearable device. While internal emails show
interest in iyO's 3D ear-scanning technology and audio hardware,
official court statements maintain that their upcoming AI product is
still in early design stages and at least a year from release. 

 ELEVENLABS RELEASES A STANDALONE VOICE GENERATION APP (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 ElevenLabs has launched a standalone mobile app for iOS and Android,
allowing users to generate AI-powered voice clips directly from text
without needing the web platform. The app provides access to
ElevenLabs' latest v3 alpha text-to-speech models, offering expressive
voice control and shared credit limits across web and mobile
platforms. This marks the company's second consumer-facing app.
ElevenLabs plans to expand its offerings to include speech-to-text and
conversational AI tools, positioning itself against competitors like
Speechify and Captions.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SEVEN MOMENTS THAT SHAPED FIGMA, AS TOLD BY DYLAN FIELD (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Figma CEO Dylan Field shares seven pivotal moments from his journey,
including how childhood acting led to a Windows XP commercial and how
a middle school janitor sparked his mathematical interests. His
unconventional Thiel Fellowship essay about disliking chocolate helped
him secure funding, though the company briefly considered becoming a
meme generator before focusing on design tools. The pandemic inspired
FigJam when users began socializing in Figma. Field credits timing,
mentorship, and his partnership with co-founder Evan Wallace as key
factors in the company's success. 

 WHY I WENT VIDEO-FIRST WITH MY DESIGN PORTFOLIO — AND HOW YOU CAN,
TOO (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A designer adopted a video-first approach for their portfolio,
recording presentations of their work to help potential employers
understand their communication style and design process before
scheduling interviews. The strategy involved creating slide
presentations in Figma first and then recording walkthroughs with
Screen Studio, which were embedded into their existing portfolio
website alongside text summaries and slide decks. This approach
leverages improved recording tools, addresses the dynamic nature of
modern design work, and aligns with remote work communication patterns
while providing an early competitive advantage in job applications. 

 SOMETIMES HARD UI CAN BE A BLESSING (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Harder-to-use interfaces can improve user outcomes when designed
intentionally, as research on disfluent fonts shows that cognitive
strain helps people think more carefully and perform better on complex
tasks. The key factor is user motivation - B2C users who personally
need to solve problems are often more willing to engage with added
complexity than B2B users who may be using software out of obligation.
Examples include legal advice apps that improved query quality by
replacing simple text fields with guided prompts and B2B tools where
power users prefer complex interfaces like command lines for greater
control and efficiency.

 CREATING A SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This tutorial explains how to create semantic color variables that
describe function rather than appearance, building on accessible color
palettes. It demonstrates how to create neutral, primary, and
state-based color groups with fill, border, and text variants for
design flexibility. The system uses reusable modifier classes like
.primary and .outline that can be combined across components, allowing
the entire design system to change color by updating just the root
variables.

 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH APPLE'S AD DEPARTMENT? (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Apple, once known for its iconic advertising, has recently faced
backlash after releasing—and quickly pulling—four controversial
ads in just over a year, including the cringeworthy “Parent
Presentation” and the widely criticized “Crush” iPad Pro spot.
These missteps, along with underwhelming product rollouts and
marketing misfires, have led many to question whether Apple's
once-brilliant ad machine is losing its touch.
