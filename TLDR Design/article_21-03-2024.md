NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE IPHONE 16: EVERYTHING WE KNOW, FROM DESIGN TO AI FEATURES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The iPhone 15 lineup brought significant upgrades, with the Pro model
featuring a titanium body and a customizable Action Button, while the
standard version included features like Dynamic Island. Expectations
are high for the iPhone 16, rumored to have larger screen sizes and
potential AI enhancements. The release is anticipated for September,
with prices likely to remain similar to the iPhone 15's. 

 ADOBE SUBSTANCE 3D‚ÄôS AI FEATURES CAN TURN TEXT INTO BACKGROUNDS AND
TEXTURES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe has introduced two new integrations for its Substance 3D design
software suite that allow 3D artists to create assets quickly for
their projects using text descriptions. Using the Text to Texture
feature in Substance 3D Sampler, designers can create photorealistic
or stylized textures for 3D models. Another feature is Generative
Backgrounds for Substance 3D Stager, which lets designers use text
prompts to create background images for objects they compose into 3D
scenes. Text to Texture and Generative Background are free during beta
and available in Substance 3D Sampler 4.4 and Stager 3.0 beta
versions. 

 SPACE FORCE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO SEE ITS SECRET LOGO MOCKUPS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The U.S. Space Force logo has been criticized for its obvious Trekkie
influence. If you've wondered what other logo designs were considered,
you will see them sometime soon. As a tardy response to Reason's
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the Air Force redacted all
images of alternate logo designs that didn't make the cut.

 WILL AI DEVICES KILL UX? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI will require UI/UX to be simple enough to support the navigational
UI of devices like the AI pin and Rabbit R1. The coming years will
probably be about very focused, value-oriented apps that can be
integrated into broader ecosystems. In the future, marketplaces will
be driven by autonomous agents that find the best solution for unique
use cases. Focus and simplicity will be essential. 

 CREATING A UX STRATEGY (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Approximately 50% of engineering time is devoted to reworking.
Building a solid UX strategy as soon as possible will save you a lot
of trouble and time. Having a baseline set of goals and guidelines
will keep you and your team from getting confused while doing the best
work possible. 

 HOW EFFECTIVE DATA STORYTELLING CAN ALLOW YOU TO DESIGN MEANINGFUL
CHANGES (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Data Storytelling (combining data, storytelling, and visuals) helps
designers effectively communicate insights, create empathy, and drive
change. By asking the right questions, designers can inform, cater to
their audience, visualize data effectively, and avoid the backfire
effect.

 JOHN ROMERO DOESN‚ÄôT BELIEVE IN PROTOTYPES (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Rather than relying on prototypes, legendary game designer John
Romero believes in shipping and polishing as you go. According to
Romero's biography, id Software's success was primarily built upon
emphasizing speed above all other design principles. However, its
massive success might have less to do with avoiding prototypes and
more with the sheer volume of ideas it shipped, smart division of
labor, insane work ethic, and its novel distribution model coinciding
with the rise of the internet and the PC. 

 THE POWER OF BEAUTY IN COMMUNICATING COMPLEX IDEAS (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The importance of beauty lies in communicating complex ideas,
particularly in data visualization and infographics. Beauty can draw
in an audience, make learning pleasant, trigger emotions, and create
cultural significance. The Earthrise photo is a perfect example of
Accurat's visualizations, which have made a significant impact by
provoking emotions and creating a sense of understanding and
connection.
