 MIDJOURNEY‚ÄôS NEW STYLE TUNER IS HERE. HERE‚ÄôS HOW TO USE IT. (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Midjourney‚Äôs latest update launched on the evening of Nov. 1, 2023.
Called the style tuner, it is arguably the most important update yet
for enterprises, brands, and creators looking to tell cohesive stories
in the same style. That‚Äôs because the new style tuner allows users
to generate their unique visual style and apply it to any and
potentially all images generated in the application going forward. 

 YOUTUBE TRIES TO MAKE YOUR TEENS SAFER, ADDS REMINDERS TO TAKE BREAKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In an update to how YouTube caters to teenagers, the company today
said it's changing how certain types of content are recommended to
teenagers. Specifically, content recommendations for videos determined
to be problematic if repeatedly put in front of teens‚Äîvideos related
to body image and non-contact social aggression‚Äîwill be limited.

Button may be introduced soon. It will be capacitive and, as its name
implies, could contribute to the camera system.

 HOW TO REKINDLE YOUR SPARK AFTER WORKING IN DESIGN FOR A LONG TIME (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It happens to the best of us ‚Äî we lose our spark, feel stuck,
become risk-averse, and lose our passion. It's a bit like a long-term
relationship that's run into the sand. However, rather than a
relationship with a person, it's our relationship with creativity
itself that's in trouble. When that happens, talk to others, find the
type of work that motivates you, get involved in a community, and stop
comparing yourself to others to help find that spark again. 

 CREATIVE CONNECTION: WHAT A DRUMMING GORILLA CAN TEACH DESIGNERS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Drumming Gorilla ad from Cadbury was one of the world's best ads,
mainly due to its emotional impact on audiences. Using AI in a
designer's workflow today can be challenging because these tools are
biased towards standardization. Cadbury's epic ad offers valuable
lessons to designers on how to take advantage of the enhanced
efficiency provided by artificial intelligence without sacrificing
creativity. 

 THE VANISHING DESIGNER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Every business is an app, and every app feels the same because every
designer has the same resume, follows the same process, graduates from
the same program, uses the same tools, and scrolls the same Dribbble
feed. Design is now about tangibles, measurables, and deliverables
instead of intuition and ingenuity. Even companies that claim to be
"design-driven" extensively use dashboards and metrics to guide their
designers.

 BREAKING THE FIGMA ADDICTION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There's a big delusion in the design industry: that the correct
design is knowable without building anything. Delaying building is
delaying design because building helps you find the right design.
Instead of always preparing hi-fi mockups, designers should work in
sync with developers, stop fearing low quality, ensure that the work
is well-discovered and well-shaped, and they should help developers
stop fearing rework. 

 COMPONENT DRIVEN USER INTERFACES (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Shipping large user interfaces can take much time and effort. The
modular approach makes it easy to build UIs that are robust, scalable,
and flexible. Throughout this guide, you will learn about Component
Driven User Design, its benefits, resources, and tools for
implementing it. 

 FIGMA‚ÄôS FUTURE IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN DESIGN‚ÄîOR GETTING ACQUIRED
(23 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 It's been over a year since Adobe's agreement to buy Figma and the
platform is still trying to figure it out as an independent company.
Dylan Field, cofounder and CEO of Figma, believes that the design tool
will have a much more significant impact on how work gets done in the
future. The acquisition of Diagram, a five-person startup building AI
Figma plug-ins such as Magician, might provide clues about what's
next.
