NEWS & TRENDS

 MICROSOFT PAINT IS GETTING ITS OWN PHOTOSHOP-LIKE PROJECT FILES (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft introduced project files to Paint that function like
Photoshop Documents, allowing users to save work with layers intact
and resume editing later. The update also adds opacity sliders for
pencil and brush tools to control transparency levels. Windows 11's
Snipping Tool has gained markup features, while Notepad has received
free AI writing assistance for Copilot Plus PC users. 

 INDIA LEADS THE WAY ON GOOGLE'S NANO BANANA WITH A LOCAL CREATIVE
TWIST (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Nano Banana image-generation model has made India its
leading market, propelling the Gemini app to the top of the charts
with 15.2 million downloads this year. Indian users are creating
unique local trends, such as retro Bollywood portraits, AI-generated
saree images, and vintage cityscapes, which are spreading globally.
Despite leading in usage, India contributes only 1.5% of Gemini's $6.4
million in revenue, although it shows the fastest month-over-month
spending growth at 18%. 

 TIRED OF COOKIE CONSENT POP-UPS? YOU SOON MAY SEE LESS OF THEM (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The EU is reviewing its 2009 e-Privacy Directive, which created the
widespread cookie consent pop-ups, and may relax the rules to reduce
user frustration. Possible changes include adding more exceptions or
letting users set consent in their browser. Privacy advocates warn
this could weaken protections and expand data use for advertising.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 RESEARCH IS A LEADERSHIP SKILL; DON'T CEDE IT TO AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Research serves as a critical leadership tool for creating
stakeholder alignment and shared understanding, not just data
collection. AI tools undermine this process by eliminating human
participation in knowledge creation, preventing the development of
ownership and commitment that drives organizational action. Effective
UX research requires building stakeholder mental models through
collaborative engagement, a process that AI cannot replicate, despite
promises of increased efficiency. 

 ONBOARDING AND CONNECTING SMART DEVICES: FIVE GUIDELINES FOR
USER-FRIENDLY SMART-DEVICE APPS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Smart-device apps require clear, visual step-by-step onboarding flows
to prevent users from abandoning devices during setup. Reconnection
should mirror the initial setup with automatic detection and detailed
guidance, as users rarely recall the exact steps. Apps must also
support flexible device management, provide honest progress
indicators, and handle errors transparently with specific messaging
and actionable solutions. 

 HOW TO SPOT SIGNS OF UX MATURITY REGRESSION (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The UX-maturity model outlines how organizations progress in UX
across strategy, culture, process, and outcomes. Maturity can regress
if practices stagnate, leadership changes, or UX becomes siloed. Teams
can prevent drift by watching for early signals, keeping lightweight
check-ins, broadening ownership beyond UX, and integrating maturity
into ongoing business processes to maintain momentum.

 STOP SAYING YOU'RE AI-NATIVE: START SHOWING IT (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Being AI-native requires hands-on experimentation with AI tools
rather than just designing AI interfaces. True AI-native professionals
build personal tools, push AI systems to their limits, and develop
strong opinions through constant use of various models and platforms.
Hire designers who demonstrate genuine AI fluency through personal
projects, documented failures, and in-depth toolchain knowledge,
rather than theoretical experience. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TRUST IN AI: A GUIDE TO MEASURING AND DESIGNING FOR
USER CONFIDENCE (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Trust in AI systems can be measured and designed for, identifying
four key components: ability, benevolence, integrity, and
predictability. Calibrated trust—not blind trust or distrust—is
the ideal user state, requiring transparent design that acknowledges
AI limitations and potential errors. UX professionals must advocate
for genuinely trustworthy systems while avoiding "trustwashing," which
manipulates users into false confidence, particularly by addressing
user fears about job displacement through ethical research and design
practices. 

 ILLUSTRATED THINKING: WHY BRANDS ARE TURNING BACK TO DRAWING (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Illustration has declined in advertising due to risk-averse clients,
slower production, and misconceptions of it being “childlike,” but
it remains powerful for distinctiveness, flexibility, and impact,
especially in murals, toolkits, and digital activations. Experts see a
resurgence ahead, with opportunities in motion, hybrid projects, and
illustrators acting as creative partners, making illustrated campaigns
stand out in a photo-saturated landscape.
