NEWS & TRENDS

 SNAPCHAT ROLLS OUT SPONSORED AI LENSES FOR BRANDS (2 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Snapchat's new Sponsored AI Lenses feature lets brands create
immersive, AI-generated experiences using selfies. Powered by
generative AI, these lenses boost engagement and reduce production
time. Brands like Tinder and Uber have reported higher interaction
rates. This marks another step in Snap's broader integration of
generative AI across its platform and ad offerings. 

 THE VOLKSWAGEN LOGO IS SUDDENLY CAUSING MASS CONFUSION AND
FRIENDSHIP-ENDING ARGUMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 There is debate over whether the V and W in the Volkswagen logo, one
of the most recognizable car emblems, were ever joined. Although the
official design always included a gap, some remember a conjoined
version, likely due to manufacturing inconsistencies or the Mandela
effect. Originally tied to Nazi-era imagery, the logo was later
redesigned into the simple VW in a circle seen today. 

 INTRODUCING KERMIT: A TYPEFACE FOR KIDS (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kermit is a playful, child-friendly typeface created to support young
readers, including those with dyslexia. Its approachable design,
expressive features, and animated versions aim to improve
comprehension and build confidence. Developed with scientific input,
Kermit is intended to be more than just a font. It is designed to make
reading easier, more engaging, and accessible for all children.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 VIBE CODING IS EXCITING BUT DESIGNERS MUST TREAD CAREFULLY (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 "Vibe coding" allows non-specialists to create digital products by
using plain language to guide AI, making design and development more
accessible. While it offers creative freedom, it also raises concerns
around intellectual property, safety, and misuse. To create more
human-centered digital experiences, it's important to use vibe coding
alongside human expertise rather than as a replacement. 

 WRITING THE ONBOARDING EXPERIENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital product design guides users from the first screen with clear
interfaces and thoughtful writing that teach interaction patterns.
Onboarding is key and works best when it sets expectations, offers
early value, and shows progress. Great onboarding respects the user by
keeping things optional, allowing guest access, and sometimes skipping
explanations to let the interface speak for itself. 

 THE DUMBEST DESIGN SYSTEM MISTAKES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems often fail due to rushed rollouts, poor collaboration,
lack of maintenance, and misplaced priorities. Avoid common pitfalls
by prioritizing user needs, involving teams early, documenting
thoroughly, and treating systems as evolving products. Component count
isn't a measure of success - success is measured by adoption,
usability, and impact on real-world workflows.

 CHEETOS PANTS AD CAMPAIGN: STYLE & (FUN)CTION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cheetos launched a playful ad campaign with limited-edition orange
pants featuring built-in towel-like panels to solve the "Cheetle
fingers" mess. Created with BBDO and fashion designers, the pants
blend humor, function, and brand identity, turning snack culture into
streetwear. A curated online collection makes the concept fun,
memorable, and shareable. 

 THESE DIGITAL ARTISTS HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST
UNETHICAL AI (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Since 2022, artists have resisted generative AI by filing lawsuits,
lobbying lawmakers, and raising public awareness. Activist groups like
EGAIR influenced the EU's AI Act, requiring consent for training data.
Legal battles persist, with courts examining copyright implications.
Artists stress solidarity, education, and the unique value of human
creativity over machine-generated content. 

 THIN FONTS ARE A USABILITY NIGHTMARE—AND FINALLY, DESIGNERS ARE
WAKING UP (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Thin fonts, once favored for their sleek look, have proven hard to
read and inaccessible, especially on mobile and for users with visual
impairments. Major brands like Apple and Google are now shifting to
bolder, more legible typography to prioritize usability and meet
accessibility standards. This marks a broader industry move toward
design that puts function over fashion.
