 "BURN IT AND KILL IT”: FANS TEAR NEW EUROVISION LOGO TO SHREDS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Eurovision's 2026 logo redesign, created by the European Broadcasting
Union and UK agency PALS, has sparked intense backlash from fans who
call it the "biggest downgrade" in the contest's 70-year history. The
updated design features more rounded, juvenile typography and makes
"song contest" more prominent than the main Eurovision wordmark,
leading critics to compare it unfavorably to a TikTok rebrand. Fans
have criticized specific details like inconsistent capitalization,
with many expressing strong disapproval of the departure from the
beloved 2004 design.

across disciplines through inclusive, scalable programs. These

PLAYLISTS (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

users to add custom transitions—like fades, rises, and
blends—between tracks in their playlists, with additional controls

 THE ANATOMY OF AN ACTIVATION: HOW FIGMA COMMONS BROUGHT DESIGN TO THE
PUBLIC (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma celebrated its NYSE listing on July 31 with "Figma Commons," a
massive public event outside the New York Stock Exchange featuring
interactive experiences, local food vendors, and citywide marketing
activations. The celebration included a colossal Brooklyn mural, Times
Square billboards, hands-on Figma Make stations, and custom
merchandise, all designed to make design feel accessible to everyone.
Approximately 4,500 attendees participated in the block-party-style
event, which aimed to humanize the brand and foster community
connections rather than follow traditional corporate IPO ceremonies. 

 VIBE CODING AND THE ILLUSION OF PROGRESS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI has revolutionized code generation through "vibe coding," allowing
developers to create features in minutes using natural language
prompts. However, this speed creates a dangerous illusion of progress,
as teams mistake rapid output for genuine value creation while the
fundamental challenge of understanding user needs remains unchanged.
The most successful approach combines AI's development speed with
rigorous user research and validation, ensuring that faster building
doesn't lead to building the wrong solutions more efficiently.

 DESIGNING FOR AUTONOMY: UX PRINCIPLES FOR AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI systems are evolving from reactive chatbots to autonomous agents
that can pursue goals, make decisions, and act independently without
constant user supervision. This shift requires UX designers to create
interfaces that maintain trust and transparency while supporting
systems that operate asynchronously and may change application states
without immediate user awareness. Design teams must adopt an
"AI-first" philosophy, focusing on outcomes rather than traditional UI
flows, and build explainability, interruptibility, and state
management into experiences where users collaborate with intelligent
systems that act on their behalf.
