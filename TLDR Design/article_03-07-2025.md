MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma has filed an initial S-1, revealing strong financials including
$749 million in revenue for 2024 and 91% gross margins, signaling
readiness for a major IPO that could raise up to $1.5 billion. Despite

returned to profitability and faces strong investor interest, though
it acknowledges rising competition from AI-driven design tools as a
potential risk.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CLS IS THE NEW PAGE SPEED: WHY DESIGNERS NEED TO CARE MORE THAN
DEVELOPERS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), a Core Web Vital that measures visual
stability, has become a critical UX metric that designers must
address, not just developers. Modern design decisions, such as
undefined image heights, custom fonts without fallbacks, and unplanned
dynamic content, directly cause layout shifts that frustrate users and
harm search rankings. Designers need to adopt CLS-conscious workflows
by reserving space for loading content, planning font fallback
behavior, and creating stable layouts that survive real-world loading
conditions. 

 CHALLENGES IN RETHINKING USER INTERFACE DESIGN FOR AGE OF AI (9
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI interface design faces critical challenges as it moves beyond
traditional visual patterns to prompt-based systems. Designers must
address cognitive overload from learning prompts, explainability
issues where users struggle to understand AI reasoning, and
hallucination problems where AI generates convincingly incorrect
answers. Solutions include integrating traditional UI elements with
prompts, providing citations and confidence scores, building
transparency through source access, and carefully elevating existing
workflows rather than replacing them entirely. 

 FRESH EYES EFFECT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When we stop questioning routines and operate on autopilot, we lose
creativity—something that can be reignited by inviting "fresh eyes"
to challenge long-held assumptions and flip familiar processes, like
how we hire, market, or support customers. This “power of 180”
shows that breakthrough ideas often come not from deep domain
expertise, but from outsiders unburdened by norms capable of spotting
overlooked problems and offering surprising, valuable perspectives.

 DESIGNING USER-CENTRIC FORMS: FOUR GREAT FORM EXAMPLES (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Effective form design requires balancing business needs, user
experience, and visual design through stakeholder alignment and the
use of progressive disclosure techniques. Research shows that
multi-step forms with conversational language can increase completion
rates by up to 214% compared to traditional approaches. Companies like
Intuit and Mailchimp demonstrate how human-centered design,
comprehensive testing, and strategic microcopy transform forms from
interrogations into engaging conversations that drive both user
satisfaction and business growth.
