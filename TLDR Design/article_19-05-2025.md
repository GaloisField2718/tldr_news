NEWS & TRENDS

 WIX RELEASES WIXEL: THE AI DESIGN TOOL THAT WANTS TO DO IT ALL (BUT
CAN IT?) (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Wix has launched Wixel, an AI design tool for non-designers to create
professional visuals quickly. Wixel blends image editing, layout
design, and AI content in one platform with background removal, image
generation, and brand styling features. There is a free tier and a Pro
plan for small businesses and creators. While handy, it feels like a
version 1 that may trade originality for ease. 

 DEMAND FOR FREELANCERS EXPLODES, THANKS TO AGENTIC AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Companies are rapidly hiring freelancers for AI agent implementation,
with global search interest up 18,347% and 19,033% in Germany. This
boom reflects growing interest in agentic AI despite limited in-house
skills. At the same time, the demand for freelancers to “humanize”
AI content is up by 641%. Workflow tools like Go High Level and
Substack also see rising demand, up 1,489% and 2,028%. 

 WATCH OUT AMAZON, THERE'S A NEW SMILE LOGO IN TOWN (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 NABS, a century-old charity supporting mental wellness in
advertising, media, and marketing, has unveiled a vibrant new identity
by agency Nice and Serious to enhance its visibility and impact.
Centered on the theme of "The Unstoppable Ally," the rebrand features
accessible typography, bold visuals, and a hands-on, compassionate
tone to communicate its mission better and reach a broader audience
during a growing mental health crisis.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN IN THE AGE OF VIBES (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI design tools like Bolt, Lovable, and Figma Make are speeding up
software prototyping, cutting reliance on traditional workflows. This
shift redefines designers' and developers' roles to focus more on
system thinking and adaptability than experience. As UI work
commodifies, real value lies in strategy, collaboration, and crafting
unique experiences beyond AI's reach. 

 FIGMA SITES: INNOVATION OR EXPLOITATION? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma Sites promises to let designers publish interactive websites
directly from Figma, but it currently produces cluttered, non-semantic
code that lacks accessibility and SEO best practices. Despite being
marketed as a production-ready tool, the output quality suggests it's
more suited for prototyping than real-world deployment. Designers
should critically assess such tools and advocate for solutions,
prioritizing clean, maintainable, and standards-compliant code. 

 IN DEFENSE OF SCREENS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Screens act as vital memory aids, much like chalkboards for Einstein,
freeing our brains by holding information. Instead of eliminating
screens, we should improve them and rethink the content and business
models behind them. Screens enable fast visual processing and offer
lasting reference, something voice interfaces can't match, making them
powerful cognitive tools.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ORGANIZING A DESIGN SYSTEM VIA FOLKSONOMY (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design systems often rely on rigid hierarchies that clash with users'
mental models, limiting adoption. A better approach is using
folksonomies—user-created tags like Gmail labels or hashtags—which
allow flexible, intuitive organization. This encourages collaboration
and discovery, though it needs identity, moderation, and curation.
Unlike AI classifiers, folksonomies reflect human intent and meaning. 

 FIGMA'S HIDDEN COSTS (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Figma's monetization hurts trust and defies product-led growth.
Upgrading from free is confusing, with misleading formulas, hidden
settings, and unclear pricing. It can auto-add seats without notice,
doubling costs and penalizing collaboration—its key feature. Canva,
by contrast, offers more straightforward pricing and a more
collaboration-friendly setup.
