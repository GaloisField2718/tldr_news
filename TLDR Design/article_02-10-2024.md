 THE ‚ÄòNEW YORK TIMES' JUST LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST APP REDESIGN IN 16
YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The New York Times has redesigned its app for the first time in 16
years, introducing a ribbon that organizes content into sections like
News, Lifestyle, and Election 2024, with a thumb-friendly navigation
similar to flipping through a newspaper. The update integrates NYT
properties such as Cooking, Wirecutter, and The Athletic, aiming for a
more open and user-friendly experience. 

 MICROSOFT COPILOT REDESIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The new Microsoft Copilot offers four natural-sounding voices,
separate from Azure Speech Services, and can hum based on a sample,
though voice mode isn't currently active. It allows sending images
without text, blurs faces instantly, accepts one image at a time, and
features updated fonts, including Cascadia Code for code blocks. 

 SQUARESPACE'S AI IMAGE GENERATION COULD BE A RISKY MOVE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Squarespace has integrated AI image and text generation into its
platform, allowing websites to be automatically populated with
AI-generated content. While AI tools offer innovative design
solutions, some users may question the authenticity of AI-driven
sites. Squarespace joins other website builders leveraging AI to
streamline the design process for small businesses.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 JUSTIFYING DESIGN'S IMPACT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The role of UCD professionals is often questioned, especially when
justifying their costs and impact in complex organizations. Success is
hard to measure when more prominent cultural factors influence
outcomes. To demonstrate value, teams should show smaller, measurable
wins, maintain communication, and build relationships within the
organization. 

 THE ROADS NOT TAKEN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design is an exploratory journey filled with choices, slips, and
accidents. While feedback and reflection strengthen our decisions,
design crits reveal the value of understanding the process. Embracing
accidents fosters discovery and learning from these moments opens new
creative pathways. 

 DESIGN SYSTEM PRIMITIVES (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Systems should prioritize core components, patterns, and tokens to
maintain design consistency while allowing flexibility. This would
empower teams to build local components using primitives like Box,
Stack, and Grid. These flexible, token-connected primitives reduce
cognitive overhead, improve productivity, and offer a type-safe
alternative to inline styles for efficient development.
