MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Vizcom has closed a $20 million Series A round of financing to

empowers them with an intuitive user interface that allows them to
import sketches, draw directly within the application, and refine
designs using natural language commands.

 DESIGN IS POLITICS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The design process is more than hiding in isolation and revealing
your masterpiece after some time. You are usually expected to work
with others while producing your work, communicating effectively,
de-escalating arguments, making and explaining decisions, organizing
projects, etc. In reality, refusing to "participate in the
organization's politics" will likely hurt your odds of being
successful.

READ) [13] 

 Video games are increasingly using illustration and painterly art to
make mesmerizing and charming visual experiences, elevating them to
the status of art, as evidenced by museum exhibits in places like the
