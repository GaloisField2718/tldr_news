NEWS & TRENDS

 IOS 27 WILL BRING LIQUID GLASS CHANGES, AND I'M EXCITED FOR ONE
REASON (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iOS 27 is expected to introduce modest interface tweaks—less
extensive than iOS 26's Liquid Glass redesign—while Apple focuses
primarily on AI improvements and bug fixes. However, the update is
notable as the first under new design leader Steve Lemay, who replaced
Alan Dye, and may signal a shift toward refining usability and
addressing areas where recent visual changes have impacted
functionality. 

 GOOGLE MAPS LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR SOME USERS IN BIG CHANGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google Maps appears to have introduced a "limited view" mode for
logged-out users, stripping key features such as nearby business
listings, user reviews, and dine-in details. Whether the change is
intentional or a glitch remains unclear, as some users received error
messages suggesting network or browser extension issues, while others
saw the stripped-back version with no error at all. 

 NEW FIGMA MAKE CONNECTORS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 New connectors in Figma Make now allow teams to pull in context from
tools like Amplitude, Box, Dovetail, Granola, Marvin, and zeroheight.
Custom connectors can also be configured by connecting any remote MCP
server through the Connectors settings. Organization admins have
control over connector access and publishing via admin settings.

 DESIGNERS WHO PARTNER WITH AI WILL WIN (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers who embrace AI as a creative partner — not a replacement
— will gain a decisive edge in speed, strategy, and collaboration.
AI is already used daily at Rule29 and O'Neil Printing to accelerate
ideation, align teams more quickly, and sharpen strategic thinking.
The human skills of taste, empathy, and judgment remain irreplaceable,
and AI only makes them more valuable. 

 YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM WORKS IN FIGMA. DOES IT WORK IN CODE? (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Design systems often fail not because of poor components, but because
design files and code speak different languages, creating friction at
every handoff. Five practices help bridge that gap: structuring
code-like frames, building through composition, organizing components
by decision flow, using AI to validate naming and structure, and
making documentation part of the design process. When systems mirror
how code works, translation becomes effortless, and the system scales
without breaking. 

 DESIGNERS ARE WARMING UP TO THE CONTROVERSIAL UTAH 2034 LOGO (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Utah's bold and initially divisive 2034 Winter Olympics
logo—featuring angular typography inspired by the state's landscapes
and petroglyphs—has recently seen warmer reception during the Milano
Cortina 2026 Games, with many praising its uniqueness and practicality
despite early criticism. However, it's only a transitional design. The
official logo is set to debut in 2029.

 HOW TO SHARE YOUR WORK ON DRIBBBLE WHILE ATTRACTING THE RIGHT CLIENTS
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dribbble designers who grow their businesses share work regularly and
clearly, focusing on quality over volume. Each shot should include a
descriptive title, context-rich description, and specific tags to help
clients and Dribbble's search engine surface the right work. A
complete profile — with availability status, bio, and consistent
skills — is what converts a visitor into a potential client. 

 OPENAI: FROM ADS TO CONTENT (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ads in ChatGPT don't have to harm user experience and could actually
improve recommendations if treated as high-utility, verified content
rather than interruptions. AI could provide more accurate, real-time,
and context-aware suggestions by integrating directly with brand
catalogs and APIs instead of scraping biased web content, provided
OpenAI maintains strict neutrality, clear labeling, user control,
privacy protections, and prioritizes relevance over ad revenue. 

 ALTERNATIVE IPHONE APP STORES EXPAND IN EU AND JAPAN (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 New regulations in the EU (Digital Markets Act) and Japan have ended
Apple's App Store exclusivity, allowing alternative iOS app
marketplaces like AltStore PAL, Epic Games Store, Aptoide, Skich,
Mobivention, and Onside to operate under Apple's notarization system
but with their own policies, fees, and discovery models. While this
creates new opportunities and competitive economics for
developers—alongside added complexity, regional fees, and security
variations—it signals the start of a more competitive, multipolar
iOS ecosystem where curation, exclusives, pricing, and user experience
will determine which stores succeed.
