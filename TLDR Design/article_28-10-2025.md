 RESTYLE YOUR INSTAGRAM STORIES USING META AI TO TAKE YOUR CREATIVITY
FURTHER (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Instagram has introduced a new restyle feature, powered by Meta AI,
that lets users edit photos and videos in Stories by adding, removing,
or changing elements via text prompts or preset effects. Users can
make simple edits like removing backgrounds or adding accessories,
apply creative effects like watercolor or film noir, and even
transform video backgrounds into underwater or snowy landscapes. The
feature includes Add Yours stickers that enable friends to replicate
edits and start viral trends across the platform. 

 NETFLIX GOES ‘ALL IN' ON GENERATIVE AI AS ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
REMAINS DIVIDED (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Netflix is embracing generative AI as a production tool. CEO Ted
Sarandos maintains it won't replace creative storytelling, citing
recent uses in shows like "The Eternaut" and "Happy Gilmore 2" for
visual effects and de-aging. The streaming giant's AI adoption comes
amid industry-wide concerns about job displacement and unauthorized
use of artists' work in training data, with recent controversies
involving OpenAI's Sora 2 model generating deepfakes of actors.
Despite positioning itself as "all in" on AI technology, Netflix
reported quarterly revenue of $11.5 billion, falling short of its
forecast despite 17% year-over-year growth. 

 MICROSOFT INTRODUCES MICO – A NEW VIRTUAL ASSISTANT FOR COPILOT (1
MINUTE READ) [6]

Clippy that reacts to user speech with expressive animations and
emotions. Currently available only in the US, it features memory for
user details and a Learn Live tutoring mode with a virtual whiteboard.
It represents an effort to give Copilot a more human-like personality.
Mico even has a Clippy-style Easter egg animation.

 DESIGN SYSTEMS: FROM THE BASICS TO BIG THINGS AHEAD (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Design systems provide the structured foundation essential for
maintaining consistency at scale, especially as AI tools accelerate
workflows and require codified context to produce accurate, on-brand
results. Organizations like Spotify, eBay, and Pinterest demonstrate
how comprehensive documentation, cross-platform coherence, and
measurable adoption metrics transform design systems from reference
guides into drivers of efficiency and quality. From their origins in
print media style guides to today's digital implementations, design
systems bridge design and development while becoming increasingly
critical as AI democratizes product creation. 

 STOP DUMPING THE SPICE RACK (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over-explaining is like over-seasoning food—adding so much detail
that the main point gets buried. Many people do this out of fear of
being misunderstood, wanting to prove their effort, or confusing
completeness with clarity, but it only leads to confusion and lost
attention. The key is to focus on one clear message, tailor it to the
audience, and cut everything that doesn't serve that goal, because
concise, intentional communication is what truly connects and
persuades. 

 RIGHT NARRATIVES SHAPE LASTING PRODUCTS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Humans make sense of the world through stories that shape identity,
purpose, and connection. Great brands like Apple and Nike succeed by
aligning their narratives with human emotions and aspirations,
enabling transformation rather than just selling. True narrative
design favors context, empathy, and meaning over pure logic, focusing
on values like truth and belonging. As AI increasingly shapes our
choices, authentic, human-centered storytelling will be essential to
preserve meaning and resist manipulation.

 THE HIDDEN COSTS OF BAD CLIENT COMMUNICATION IN DESIGN PROJECTS AND
HOW TO FIX THEM (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Poor client-designer communication in design projects leads to costly
rework, wasted resources, delayed timelines, and compromised quality
due to misaligned expectations and vague feedback. The disconnect
stems from designers focusing on visuals and user flows while clients
prioritize business goals, compounded by unclear briefs, scattered
feedback channels, poor planning, and the absence of version control.
Solutions include structured discovery processes with clear
documentation, consolidated feedback platforms with version control,
regular check-ins, and visual communication tools that help both
parties speak the same language from project start to finish. 

 THE UX HACK THAT HELPS AI CAPTURE USER INTENT (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Capturing user intent through contextual prompts and predictive
suggestions helps AI tools overcome the blank-screen problem that
causes users to hesitate and abandon tasks. Effective AI interfaces
use patterns like search chips, file upload suggestions, and content
presets to guide users toward their goals without overwhelming them.
By anticipating what users want to accomplish rather than just
reacting to their literal inputs, AI transforms from a passive tool
into an active assistant that balances helpful guidance with user
autonomy. 

 DESIGN BUSINESS' CONFIDENCE “LOWEST SINCE COVID” (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 A new Design Business Association report shows that 23% of UK design
firms are struggling or cutting costs, marking the lowest confidence
since the pandemic due to rising expenses, reduced client budgets, and
AI's impact on design value. However, overseas income is up to
36.5%—an 80% rise over the past decade—while the London pricing
premium is shrinking as remote work evens the playing field. The
report also highlights growth in regional agencies and a rising need
for green design skills.
