select channels through its new Shows feature. The redesign features

programming traditional TV networks produce.

MINUTE READ) [5]

larger display with a new 422 x 514 resolution, as revealed in the iOS

 APPLE'S LATEST LIQUID GLASS DESIGN SHOWS IT WON'T BACK DOWN WITH IOS
26 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 iOS 26's standout feature is the new Liquid Glass design. Despite
some early backlash during the beta cycle, Apple has doubled down on
its original vision, refining and expanding it with each release. With
the latest beta showing minimal changes and Apple's typical pattern of
locking in final designs by August, Liquid Glass is all but confirmed
to ship in next month's official release, with potential refinements
likely to follow in later updates.

 WHAT DESIGNING AI-CENTRIC PRODUCTS LOOKS LIKE NOW AND IN THE (NEAR)
FUTURE (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The conversational AI market faces explosive growth from £9.2B to
£46.4B by 2032, despite only 46% of users trusting AI systems.
Traditional interfaces are shifting toward natural language commands,
fundamentally reimagining how humans interact with digital products
and systems. Future AI-centric products will likely emphasize strong
personalities and gamification while requiring designers to balance
enhancement with unnecessary complexity. 

 WHAT I LOOK FOR IN DESIGN PORTFOLIOS (AND WHAT MOST PEOPLE MISS) (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design portfolios stand out in today's competitive job market through
strong craft, exceptionally high-quality typography, and creative
assets that build trust before interviews begin. The medium itself
becomes the message, with thoughtful presentation proving standards
and credibility to hiring managers. Portfolios should proactively
answer common interview questions about leadership style and approach
rather than waiting to be asked. 

 HAVE DESIGN JOB ADS BECOME TOO SPECIFIC? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers are increasingly frustrated by overly specific job listings
that demand sector-specific experience, agency backgrounds, or even
niche project types—requirements seen as rigid, exclusionary, and
reflective of a risk-averse industry. While some recruiters argue this
isn't new, the economic downturn, competitive job market, and social
media visibility have amplified the issue, prompting growing debate
between hiring for safety versus valuing fresh perspectives.
