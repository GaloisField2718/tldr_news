NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE WANTS YOU TO BE ABLE TO TOUCH AND FEEL THINGS IN AR OR VR (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has secured a patent for a "Finger-Mounted Device with Sensors
and Haptics," which hints at the potential development of an "Apple
Ring" for an enhanced augmented reality (AR) experience where users
can manipulate AR objects with fingertip sensors. This technology
seeks to integrate users into an Apple AR ecosystem by providing
haptic feedback that mimics real-life sensations, like catching a
ball. The ring could function as an input device. 

 PINTEREST ROLLS OUT ITS ‚ÄòBODY TYPE RANGES‚Äô TOOL TO THE US (2

 Pinterest has launched a body type filtering feature in the U.S. that
allows users to search fashion and wedding ideas based on different
body types and showcase size-inclusive brands. The tool, powered by

user engagement. Pinterest plans to expand the feature to men's

 BRITISH MONARCHY ROCKED BY BAD PHOTOSHOP JOB (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 After months of speculation on the whereabouts of Kate Middleton, the
Princess of Wales and future Queen of England, the Royal Family
released an image on Sunday that appeared to have been edited.
Middleton claimed credit for the edits, saying she was trying to piece
together everyone's best expressions in the photo. However, there are
other issues with the photo that continue to raise questions.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BEAUTIFUL UGLY WEBSITES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Beautiful ugly websites" are lightweight, text-heavy, old-fashioned,
basic HTML-styled websites that may not be visually appealing in a
traditional sense but have a unique style and authenticity. They prove
there‚Äôs no need to over-design - minimal designs can be just as
effective as visually striking ones if they serve the ultimate goal of
selling a product. 

 SOMETIMES, A BUTTON JUST WANTS TO LOOK LIKE A BUTTON (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Modern design languages offer a lot of flexibility, focusing on
fundamentals like typography, white space, and simplistic icons.
However, sometimes, using an old-school real-world metaphor adds a lot
of delight to an experience. For example, a tactile-looking button can
be very satisfying. 

 NICHE PRODUCT DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The golden age of product design may be fading away as
standardization increases. However, niche product design still offers
exciting opportunities in product design. Going narrow allows
designers to experiment and find new levels of authenticity using an
opinionative approach, small teams, and a defined niche. An obsession
with metrics and optimization causes blandness in design solutions.
Going in the opposite direction is advantageous for businesses looking
for competitive differentiation through authenticity.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COLOR IS A FOUR LETTER WORD (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Color is both potent and volatile. What‚Äôs vibrant to one person may
be gray to another. A certain hue can mean good luck in one culture
and ‚Äúuh oh‚Äù in another. Designers should avoid using color as much
as possible, treat interfaces as a white wall, and try using grayscale
color palettes. 

 JAKOB HAS JUMPED THE SHARK (5 MINUTE READ) [15]
