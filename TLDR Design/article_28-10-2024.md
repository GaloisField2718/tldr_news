 HOW WE BUILT AI SEARCH IN FIGMA (9 MINUTE READ) [6]

faster, addressing time lost searching for designs. New features like

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CHOICE IS NOT THE ENEMY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The "don't make me think" philosophy, popularized by Steve Krug's
book, emphasizes simplicity in UX design. However, thoughtful user
engagement is now recognized as essential, especially for complex
choices like real estate or financial decisions. Offering relevant,
customizable options fosters trust and improves user experience,
moving beyond overly simplistic, one-size-fits-all designs. 

 “WINNING” BY DESIGN: DECEPTIVE UX PATTERNS AND SPORTS BETTING
APPS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gambling can be addictive due to dopamine release, even when losing.
Sports betting apps like PrizePicks and DraftKings use deceptive UX to
encourage more gambling, framing themselves as "daily fantasy" in
restricted states. Apps often require riskier bets, hide payout
details until submission, and use promo code restrictions. Companies
like Flutter track user behavior to send tailored incentives that may
exploit addiction. 

 MADE IN FIGMA: THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE GOES FROM PAPER TO PIXELS (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figma helped transform the National Park Service's (NPS) iconic
Unigrid brochures into a unified app for 431 parks, improving
accessibility, wayfinding, and user experience. Designed by GuideOne
and Twohy Design Works, the app features interactive maps, offline
access, augmented reality (AR), and real-time alerts. Prototyping in
Figma streamlined development, enhancing collaboration and creating a
stronger connection between park visitors and staff.

 HOW TO GET REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Effective feedback can transform design work, but designers must lead
feedback sessions to make them constructive. This post describes three
