READ) [4] 

 Apple has further reduced the transparency of its Liquid Glass design
elements—like navigation bars and buttons—to improve readability
following earlier complaints that the interface was too hard to see
through. While the change may enhance usability, some users feel Apple
is abandoning the original, more striking visual style, calling the
update a step backward.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 I'VE DESIGNED WITH DATA — HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GETTING WRONG (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 UX design has become overly reliant on data and metrics, leading
teams to prioritize A/B testing small changes over innovative,
human-centered problem-solving. While analytics can show what users
do, they fail to reveal why users behave in a certain way, missing
crucial emotional and motivational context that qualitative research
provides. Effective UX requires balancing data insights with
creativity and intuition, using metrics as a starting point for deeper
exploration rather than the final decision-maker. 

 WHEN FIGMA STARTS DESIGNING US (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma has evolved into a powerful tool that encourages
engineering-centric workflows, with features like Auto Layout and Dev
Mode promoting early structure and polished prototypes. While these
tools offer efficiency, they risk limiting creative exploration by
narrowing the design process too early, contributing to a homogenized
digital design landscape. 

 EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT GOOD SYSTEM DESIGN (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Good system design prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and the use
of well-established components, favoring boring, maintainable
solutions over clever or complex ones. Key principles include
minimizing stateful services, designing around hot paths, using
background jobs and caching judiciously, and ensuring systems fail
gracefully with strong observability and clear separation of
responsibilities.
