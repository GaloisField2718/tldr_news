 FIGMA'S DYLAN FIELD WILL CASH OUT ABOUT $60M IN IPO, WITH INDEX,
KLEINER, GREYLOCK, SEQUOIA ALL SELLING, TOO (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma's IPO is unusual in that existing shareholders will sell nearly
twice as many shares as the company itself. Founder Dylan Field alone
is set to cash out over $62 million while still retaining 74% voting
control thanks to supervoting shares. Major investors like Sequoia and
Greylock are also selling significant portions, signaling strong
expected demand. If the offering prices above the $25–$28 range, it
could become 2025's largest IPO to date. 

 RADICAL NEW IPHONE 17 COLOUR COULD BE A FIRST FOR APPLE (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The iPhone 17 is set to introduce Apple's most dramatic design
overhaul in years, featuring a new model, the iPhone 17 Air, a
redesigned camera for the Pro version, and a striking, light-reactive
color inspired by iOS 26's "Liquid Glass" aesthetic. This iridescent
finish marks a bold shift from Apple's traditionally conservative

recent criticisms.

 WE ASKED CREATIVES HOW THEY LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES. HERE'S WHAT THEY
SAID (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Creatives are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain
well-being in the high-pressure 2020s, but many are turning to nature,
movement, sleep, creative play, and intentional downtime to avoid
burnout. Ahead of International Self-Care Day, artists and designers
shared personal strategies—from setting boundaries to prioritizing
fun and connection—reminding us that self-care isn't a luxury, but a
vital part of sustaining a healthy creative life. 

 WHY UX DESIGNERS SHOULD CARE ABOUT MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI systems to communicate
with external tools and data sources, allowing users to accomplish
complex tasks across multiple applications through a single
conversation, rather than manually switching between isolated apps. UX
designers must evolve from designing individual applications to
creating intelligent workflows where AI orchestrates tasks across
connected systems, requiring new design patterns like conductor
interfaces and intent-based navigation. This shift represents a
fundamental change in digital experience design, offering designers
who understand MCP-enabled workflows significant career advantages as
the industry moves toward more connected, AI-powered user experiences.


 THE DEATH OF ACCOUNTABILITY: WHY NO ONE OWNS THEIR MISTAKES ANYMORE
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern workplaces suffer from an accountability crisis where leaders
and team members dodge responsibility, blame others, and prioritize
self-preservation over honesty. This culture creates toxic
environments where quality people clean up others' mistakes while
finger-pointers get promoted, leading to decreased project quality,
eroded trust, and organizational dysfunction. Building accountability
requires leaders to model ownership of mistakes, establish clear
responsibilities, document decisions, and reward honesty while
actively discouraging blame-shifting behaviors.

 THE ARTIFACTS YOU NEED TO GET HIRED (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A four-artifact system helps creative professionals get hired: a
website as a digital calling card, a presentation for interviews, a
PDF portfolio for follow-up sharing, and a resume as proof of work.
Each artifact serves a different moment in the hiring process, working
together to tell a cohesive professional story. The approach
recognizes that these tools serve as conversation starters, designed
to demonstrate thinking and spark interest in collaborative work. 

 FROM NETWORKS TO INDEPENDENCE: WHY MORE CREATIVES ARE MAKING THE LEAP
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A growing number of creative professionals, driven by frustrations
with bureaucracy and investor-focused priorities, are leaving
traditional network agencies to establish independent studios. Former
network employees describe how independence offers greater creative
freedom, closer client relationships, and more meaningful work, all
without the excessive layers of process. This migration reflects
broader industry changes, including economic pressures, evolving
client demands, and technology enabling remote collaboration, making
independent studios increasingly viable alternatives to established
networks.
