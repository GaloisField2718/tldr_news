 FIGMA SHARES SLIDE AS FIRST POST-IPO RESULTS MISS PROFIT EXPECTATIONS
(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma's shares dropped over 13% after-hours following the design
software company's first quarterly earnings since its July IPO, where
it broke even despite analyst expectations of 18 cents per share
profit. The company reported $249.6 million in Q2 revenue (up 41%
year-over-year) and launched four new products, including AI-powered
prototyping tools and website publishing capabilities. Figma forecasts
Q3 revenue of $263-265 million and full-year revenue of $1.021-1.025
billion, with strong customer metrics, including a 129% net dollar
retention rate.

READ) [5] 

 Google's September Pixel drop expands the Material 3 Expressive
design to Pixel 6 and newer devices, plus the Pixel Tablet, bringing a
more colorful look and new personalization features. The update also

 NEW AI MODEL TURNS PHOTOS INTO EXPLORABLE 3D WORLDS, WITH CAVEATS (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tencent's HunyuanWorld-Voyager is an open-weight AI model that
transforms single images into explorable 3D-consistent video sequences
by generating RGB video and depth information simultaneously. The
system allows users to define camera movements through virtual scenes,
producing 49-frame clips that maintain spatial consistency and can be
chained together for more extended sequences. However, the model
requires substantial computational power and faces geographic
licensing restrictions, preventing use in the EU, UK, and South Korea.

 HOW TO MAKE PEOPLE LISTEN TO YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 When designers feel ignored, they should investigate root causes
rather than blame dysfunctional organizations, identifying mismatches
between their expectations and leadership goals. Common reasons
include low organizational design maturity, business models that
prioritize speed over quality, working on ideas leaders don't
understand, and a lack of established trust with team members. The
recommended approach involves conducting "listening tours" with
colleagues, treating them like customers to build charm and find
allies, then demonstrating value through small wins that create
stories of problem-solving success. 

 APPROACHING DESIGN IN THE AGE OF AI (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI product design should prioritize user needs over technology,
avoiding the common trap of defaulting to chat interfaces when AI's
real value lies in inference and reasoning capabilities.
Misinformation and hallucinations require design solutions, including
user control over data sources, robust feedback systems, and
consideration of smaller language models for specific contexts. The
current moment presents both unprecedented opportunity and
responsibility for implementing responsible AI principles like
transparency and safety during this technological watershed. 

 ADAPT OR DIE? WHEN TOTAL BRAND OVERHAULS WORK, AND WHEN THEY DON'T (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Heritage brand rebrands often spark backlash, as seen with Tate &
Lyle's Golden Syrup and Cracker Barrel, where consumers resisted
changes to long-familiar packaging. Experts suggest this sensitivity
stems from people seeking stability amid broader societal flux, with
nostalgia acting as an anchor. By contrast, brands like Mailchimp
thrive on reinvention, balancing playful experimentation with
consistency to connect with creative audiences. Jaguar's bold 2024
overhaul shows that rebrands can succeed not by pleasing everyone but
by provoking strong reactions and signaling deeper philosophical
shifts, cutting through a saturated design landscape.

 WHAT DESIGNERS CAN LEARN FROM THE FIRST INTERFACE — THE HUMAN FACE
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The human face serves as the original interface, offering immediate,
cross-cultural communication through micro-expressions that evolved as
survival mechanisms. Digital interfaces attempt to replicate facial
communication through emojis, avatars, and video calls, but lose the
authenticity and spontaneity that make faces so powerful. Designers
can learn from facial principles like timing, subtlety, and
trust-building rhythms to create more natural digital experiences that
feel intuitive rather than requiring constant explanation. 

 CHAT IS: THE FUTURE OR A TERRIBLE UI (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI-powered chat interfaces divide opinions between those who see them
as software's future and others who view them as terrible UI.
Proponents argue that chat leverages existing user familiarity,
captures intent through natural language, and eliminates interface
learning curves. Critics counter that chat lacks clear affordances,
poorly displays complex information, and creates cumbersome scrolling
experiences that lose context over time. 

 THE DESIGN OF SHALLOW THINKING (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Our capacity for deep thought has been eroded less by AI and more by
how the internet's design has evolved. Early online spaces felt like
destinations that encouraged exploration, long-form expression, and
reflection, while smartphones, infinite feeds, and algorithm-driven
platforms shifted us toward shallow, compulsive consumption. These
patterns were shaped by business models built on maximizing attention,
not by accident. Rethinking design to include boundaries, stopping
points, and depth-focused features could help restore sustained
attention and more meaningful engagement.
