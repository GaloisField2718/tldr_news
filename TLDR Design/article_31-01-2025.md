remains of six million people, has an unexpectedly playful logo that

 DESIGNING FOR GENERATIVE AI EXPERIENCES (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Generative AI has evolved, transforming user expectations and
creating opportunities for UX designers to craft intuitive,
human-centered experiences. Designers must balance AI's strengths and
limitations to ensure clarity, personalization, and trust. Essential
skills include adaptability, curiosity, and systems thinking.
Expanding data literacy and collaboration will be key as AI matures.

 Adjustable interfaces give users control, while probabilistic ones
predict needs. AI-driven systems risk excluding disabled users due to
insufficient data. Ensuring accessibility requires a sequence: first,
accessibility by default; then, user customization; finally,
AI-enhanced predictions. Prioritizing adjustable interfaces today
builds data for future adaptive technology, making digital spaces
genuinely inclusive.
