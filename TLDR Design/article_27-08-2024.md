 Material Design has evolved from minimalism to prioritizing emotion
and personalization, with Material Design 3 emphasizing flexibility
through Dynamic Color. Design principles should be regularly updated

solving key issues like visual consistency or communication gaps
before implementing one. Start with design freedom and introduce

larger companies.

 There are various design system governance models, each with pros and
cons. Top-down models offer control but risk alienating feature teams,
while bottom-up models can lead to bloated systems. Federated and
hybrid models balance control and collaboration. The distributed model
promotes flexibility and innovation by dividing responsibilities
across teams.
