EDITING (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma's latest update refines the Crop tool to speed up everyday
image editing, with faster access via double-click, automatic aspect

 ADOBE HIT WITH PROPOSED CLASS-ACTION, ACCUSED OF MISUSING AUTHORS'
WORK IN AI TRAINING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe faces a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging it used pirated
books to train its SlimLM language model for mobile document
assistance. The lawsuit claims Adobe's training relied on the
SlimPajama dataset, which contains the controversial Books3 collection
of 191,000 pirated books that have sparked multiple legal battles
against tech companies. This case joins growing litigation over AI
firms allegedly training models on copyrighted materials without
author consent or compensation, following similar lawsuits against
Apple, Salesforce, and Anthropic. 

 GORDEN WAGENER LEAVES THE HELM OF MERCEDES-BENZ DESIGN AFTER 28 YEARS
WITH THE COMPANY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gorden Wagener is stepping down as chief design officer at
Mercedes-Benz after 28 years, having led the brand's design since
2016. During his tenure, he expanded Mercedes into non-automotive
sectors like speedboats and aviation, initiated high-profile
collaborations with figures like Virgil Abloh and Nigo, and
repositioned the brand as more youthful and dynamic. Bastian Baudy,
currently overseeing Mercedes-AMG, will replace Wagener in this role.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ARE WE STILL PRACTICING UX, OR JUST PRODUCING INTERFACES? (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Modern UX has shifted from a problem-solving discipline rooted in
shared foundations to a faster, solution-first practice focused on
execution and polish. While designers are highly skilled, the reduced
emphasis on problem definition, exploration, and core UX principles
risks diminishing the depth and purpose of the discipline. 

 STOP DOING UX CHEERLEADING (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX design has been reduced to "cheerleading" that legitimizes
predetermined ideas rather than solving real problems, as stakeholders
demand outputs rather than defining actual business goals. The "build,
measure, learn" framework has devolved into a linear sequence where
teams build first and validate later, using design research merely to
soothe anxiety and justify decisions already made. This
dysfunction—amplified by AI tools that generate quick
prototypes—transforms designers into accountability sinks who take
the blame when projects fail, while learning and course-correction
become impossible. 

 THE $268B DESIGN BOOM IS KILLING DESIGN AGENCIES. HERE'S WHY (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The $268 billion design agency market is growing, yet major agencies
are shutting down because clients increasingly view design as
replaceable by AI when it operates separately from business strategy.
Designers who survive close the "Integration Gap" by moving beyond
visual execution to understand business models, speak in terms of
measurable outcomes, and make strategic decisions that directly impact
revenue and company metrics. Those who remain tactical executors will
compete with AI on speed and polish, while those who integrate deeply
into business strategy become irreplaceable partners trusted to make
judgment calls when challenges arise.

 TESLA ORDERED TO REBRAND AUTOPILOT AMID FALSE ADVERTISING CLAIMS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A judge and California's DMV have ruled that Tesla's “Autopilot”
and “Full Self-Driving” branding is misleading, as it implies full
autonomy that the vehicles do not have. Unless Tesla renames the
features, it could face a ban on selling cars in California, despite
already adding caveats and rebranding Full Self-Driving as
“Supervised.” 

 TALK FIRST, DESIGN LATER: THE SECRET TO BETTER PROJECTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Effective design stems from a genuine human connection rather than
technical skills or trends. Before starting projects, research clients
as individuals and prioritize conversations over email exchanges to
understand their actual needs and concerns. This approach transforms
transactional client relationships into collaborative partnerships
where people feel heard, ultimately producing better design outcomes
than any software proficiency alone could achieve.
