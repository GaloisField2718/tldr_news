REAL-TIME CONDITIONS IN ANY CITY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A technical artist created a real-time weather visualization system
in Unreal Engine 5 using OpenWeather, World Time API, and Cesium.

 WHY OPENAI IS ONLY LETTING SOME SORA USERS CREATE VIDEOS OF REAL
PEOPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI released its video-generating tool, Sora, with a cautious
approach. It limited access to a feature that uses real images or
footage to create videos pending safety-focused evaluations. The
company is balancing innovation with the risk of misuse due to
concerns surrounding deepfakes and the potential for misinformation.
OpenAI's safety measures include moderation filters, metadata
compliance with the C2PA standard, and prompt rewriting to prevent
infringement on living artists' styles.
