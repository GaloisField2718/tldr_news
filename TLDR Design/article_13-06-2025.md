NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE IS SALVAGING IMAGE PLAYGROUND WITH A BOOST FROM CHATGPT (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple is addressing Image Playground's poor reception by integrating
ChatGPT to improve its AI image generation capabilities. The original
app faced criticism for low-quality results and limitations, with
users reporting issues like six-fingered hands and failed simple
prompts. The ChatGPT integration will add new artistic styles,
including Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, Anime, and Print, moving
beyond the current emoji-like creations. 

 PINTEREST TESTS AN AI FEATURE THAT LETS ADVERTISERS TURN THEIR
CATALOGS INTO SHOPPABLE COLLAGES (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest is testing an AI "auto-collages" feature that automatically
transforms advertiser product catalogs into shoppable visual content.
The feature groups products based on outfit ideas, user engagement
patterns, and similar items. Early tests showed users saved these
AI-generated collages at twice the rate of standard product pins.
Pinterest also announced updates to its Trends tool to help
advertisers predict future user purchasing behavior through insights
on saving and shopping patterns. 

 IN IOS 26, THE SAFARI BROWSER ON IPHONE HAS THREE DIFFERENT TOOLBAR
LAYOUTS TO CHOOSE FROM (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Safari in iOS 26 introduces a new Liquid Glass design with floating,
translucent toolbars and a revamped layout system featuring three
modes - Compact (the new default), Bottom, and Top - each adjusted to
match the updated aesthetic. While Compact closely resembles the
once-controversial iOS 15 design with a floating URL bar at the
bottom, all layouts now feature minimized, receding elements during
scroll, and Apple has notably removed the Compact mode from Safari on
macOS and iPadOS 26 for now.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 ESCAPE FROM THE FIGMA TITANIC: PART 1 — DEEP DIVE INTO AI-DRIVEN
USE CASES (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI product design should prioritize use case storyboarding over
creating pixel-perfect Figma screens to align AI systems with human
needs. There are five DOs, including starting with user intent,
testing storyboards with users before UI design, and using
subject-to-AI transitions to clarify when AI activates. It's essential
to avoid system feature focus over human outcomes, not skip AI handoff
moments, and reject static wireframes for dynamic AI intelligence. 

 EIGHT ESSENTIAL TIPS FOR USING FIGMA MAKE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma introduced Make, a prompt-to-code feature that transforms
concepts into functional prototypes through detailed prompts, at
Config 2025. The tool works best with comprehensive initial prompts,
clean design files with proper Auto Layout, and incremental
improvements rather than complex changes simultaneously. Teams can
leverage existing components for consistency, use point-and-edit for
quick visual tweaks, integrate realistic data for dynamic prototypes,
and even create handoff tools that generate production-ready code
snippets. 

 THE DESIGNER'S HIERARCHY OF CAREER NEEDS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Compensation, edification, and recognition are not equally important
in building a sustainable design career—they form a hierarchy where
financial stability must come first, followed by skill-building, and
lastly, recognition as a potential byproduct of doing meaningful work.
Prioritizing recognition too early often leads to undervalued labor
and burnout, while focusing first on getting paid and then growing
expertise lays the foundation for long-term success.

 UX CHALLENGES WITH MCPS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 MCPs (Model Context Protocols) excel at orchestration workflows like
information synthesis and task automation but struggle with iteration
workflows requiring real-time feedback and continuous refinement.
Working with MCPs involves two key UX challenges: unintuitive
configuration similar to IFTTT and interaction patterns that feel like
bridge solutions rather than natural app evolution. Most workflows are
hybrid, requiring different AI interaction approaches depending on
whether users need discrete task delegation or continuous creative
assistance with immediate visual feedback. 

 SIX WAYS TO USE DOCUMENTATION ANALYTICS IN YOUR NEXT DESIGN SYSTEM
LAUNCH (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Documentation analytics help design system teams measure launch
success by moving beyond "we shipped it" to understanding actual
impact and user engagement. The six key strategies include revisiting
original goals to assess whether updates solved intended problems,
using time filters to analyze post-launch behavior patterns, and
tracking page views versus sessions to distinguish visibility from
meaningful engagement. Teams should examine top-performing content to
identify successful patterns, address underperforming pages through
improved messaging or targeted outreach, and use insights to optimize
future launches with data-driven strategies.
