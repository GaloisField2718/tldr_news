 STABILITY AI'S LEGAL WIN OVER GETTY LEAVES COPYRIGHT LAW IN LIMBO (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Stability AI largely defeated Getty Images in a UK High Court case
over AI training data. However, the judge avoided ruling on whether AI
models require permission to use copyrighted material for
training—the central question dividing tech companies and the
creative industries. Getty won only on a narrow trademark claim
regarding watermarks but dropped its main copyright argument mid-trial
due to weak evidence, while the judge rejected secondary infringement
claims since Stable Diffusion doesn't store copyrighted works. Getty
continues to pursue similar claims against Stability in California as
part of a broader legal battle. 

 APPLE TV'S NEW SONIC LOGO IS A CERTIFIED BANGER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple TV has introduced a new sonic logo created by Finneas that
features warbling electronic sounds followed by three gentle piano
notes, offering a more calming alternative to the anxiety-inducing
idents common among streaming services. The mnemonic exists in three
versions, ranging from one to ten seconds, with the longest intended
for theatrical releases of Apple Studios films. Accompanying the audio
rebrand is a colorful animated opening bumper, signaling a playful new
direction for Apple's typically minimalist design approach. 

 JDO REFINES JAMESON'S BRAND AND PACKAGING (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jameson, the world's best-selling Irish whiskey, has unveiled a
refreshed identity by JDO that modernizes its look while honoring its
heritage. The redesign refines key brand elements—like the crest,
wordmark, and bottle design—to create visual harmony across the
portfolio, clarify each whiskey's story, and attract both new and
loyal drinkers through subtle, character-driven updates.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE FRAME, THE ILLUSION, AND THE BRIEF (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As AI takes over solution generation, designers must focus on problem
framing, a skill that is undermined by cognitive biases, such as the
need for closure, ambiguity aversion, and action bias, which push
teams toward premature answers. These tendencies cause designers to
freeze problem definitions early rather than embracing ambiguity.
However, experienced practitioners who resist this urge and refine the
frame create a shared understanding and uncover deeper insights.
Effective framing isn't a delay, but essential design work that
transforms AI outputs from noise into useful material and compounds
value throughout delivery. 

 HOW DESIGN TEAMS ARE REACTING TO 10X DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY FROM AI
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 At this point, the massive productivity gains from AI coding agents
are prompting three main reactions from design teams. Some designers
are shifting their role to focus on UX alignment after features are
built, essentially flipping the traditional design-then-develop
workflow. Others are adopting AI coding tools themselves to prototype
and ship features directly, while skeptics dismiss the speed as
"faster slop" despite developers' productivity unlikely to return to
previous levels. 

 WHY LOGO BACKLASHES AREN'T REALLY ABOUT DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Rebrands have become cultural flashpoints, reflecting deeper societal
fatigue and polarization rather than just design critique. In an era
of constant change, even small logo updates can feel like a loss of
stability or identity, making emotionally intelligent, culturally
aware design more crucial than ever to maintain trust and relevance.

 HOW TO ADAPT YOUR DESIGN PRACTICE FOR THE AGE OF GENERATIVE
TECHNOLOGY (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Generative AI has transformed product design from a two-way
human-computer interaction into a three-way Human-Model-Interface
(HMI) experience, requiring designers to have a deep understanding of
AI model capabilities, input requirements, and output quality.
Designers must now prototype early and iterate alongside model
development, considering complete end-to-end workflows while asking
whether the AI can reliably deliver on user expectations and build
trust. A four-phase framework—prompt, plan, show, and next—helps
users feel supported through AI interactions by gathering context
intelligently, clarifying next steps, providing visibility into the
model's reasoning, and offering actionable follow-up recommendations. 

 CREATIVE AGENCY IN THE AI LANDSCAPE (26 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In this post, a designer explores working with generative AI through
the lens of four artists, arguing that treating AI as an instrument
requiring skilled practice offers more creative potential than passive
"vibe coding" dependency. Brian Eno's collaborative approach, working
alongside the machine as a gardener, and Holly Herndon and Mat
Dryhurst's integration into AI systems while building ethical
frameworks, demonstrate healthier relationships with technology than
Rick Rubin's skill-free positioning under the machine. Using Hayao
Miyazaki's Spirited Away as an allegory, the post warns that AI's
insatiable consumption mirrors No Face's hunger—dangerous without
boundaries—and suggests finding creative satisfaction requires
knowing when to stop rather than feeding endless appetite. 

 BRAND STRATEGY'S NOT IN TROUBLE – BAD STRATEGY IS (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Brand strategy isn't dead—it's simply evolving. Despite claims that
AI, shifting consumer behavior, and new branding models have made it
obsolete, effective brand strategy remains rooted in timeless
storytelling and human insight. The difference now lies in crafting
bolder, more imaginative, and culturally attuned narratives that stand
out in a changing world.
