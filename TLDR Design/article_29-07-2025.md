NEWS & TRENDS

 RUMOR: IPHONE 17 PRO COULD HAVE THREE UNEXPECTED CAMERA UPGRADES (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A new anonymous tip claims the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro may feature
major camera upgrades, including an 8x optical zoom lens, a pro camera
app, and a new Camera Control button on the top edge, though these
details remain unverified and speculative. Of the rumored features,
the pro camera app seems most plausible, while hardware changes are
more doubtful given Apple's typical leak patterns and past precedents.


 RANGE ROVER “RECODES DNA” WITH NEW WORDMARK AND MOTIF (8 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Range Rover has unveiled a refined wordmark and a new visual motif as
part of Jaguar Land Rover's broader strategy to create distinct
identities for each of its four brands, aligning with a wider trend in
the luxury automotive sector to modernize visual identities for a
digital-first, younger, and more diverse audience. This shift reflects
broader industry changes driven by the rise of electric vehicles and
evolving consumer expectations, though critics warn that many rebrands
risk losing brand distinctiveness in the pursuit of minimalism and
modernity. 

 OPENAI IS PREPARING SORA 2: AN AI MODEL WILL BE TAUGHT TO "SPEAK" IN
VIDEOS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is developing Sora 2, a significant upgrade to its
text-to-video model that will integrate audio capabilities, including
speech and environmental sounds. While the current Sora generates
silent videos lasting over 20 seconds, Google's competing Veo 3
produces shorter clips with synchronized audio tracks. The
audio-enabled competition between these AI video models could
establish new creative standards while raising concerns about
potential misinformation.

 "THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN": A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ALI MARTÍN
FILSOOF (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ali Martín Filsoof, founder of LA-based Design Dept, brings a
multicultural perspective and minimalist aesthetic to branding,
drawing from influences in Tehran, Lima, and Los Angeles as well as
Japanese and Swiss design principles. His studio emphasizes strategic,

template-driven work, valuing curiosity, depth, and purpose in every
project, from luxury packaging to pro bono street vendor identities. 

 DESIGN THINKING ISN'T DEAD – IT'S MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 While some in the U.S. claim that design thinking is dead,
criticizing it as redundant or damaging, the approach continues to
prove its value globally by emphasizing human insight, strategic
problem-solving, and risk reduction in both commercial and public
sectors. Rather than being obsolete, design thinking is evolving
beyond screens and products to influence business, policy, and social
impact, and it's business, not design, that risks falling behind if it
fails to embrace this shift. 

 AI WON'T KILL UX — WE WILL (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While AI offers speed and efficiency, its reliance on past data and
patterns risks standardizing design and stifling originality,
especially when adopted uncritically at the center of the creative
process. To preserve meaningful, human-centered innovation in UX/UI,
we must intentionally integrate AI as a supportive tool, not a
replacement, while reinvesting saved time into exploration, education,
and inclusive, forward-thinking design.

 THE SECRET TO GETTING REPEAT WORK AS A FREELANCER (9 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 When freelance work dries up, the best move isn't always chasing new
clients, it's nurturing relationships with existing ones who already
trust you and often provide the most rewarding projects. By staying in
touch, being proactive, listening well, and occasionally just asking
for work, freelancers can build long-term client partnerships that
lead to more stability, more referrals, and ultimately, more
fulfilling work. 

 STOP SCROLLING: KINETIC TYPOGRAPHY IS REDEFINING UX (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Kinetic typography (moving text) is redefining digital UX,
transforming from mere eye candy into functional communication.
Advanced front-end frameworks, AI design tools, and social media's
motion-heavy aesthetic have made animated text more accessible and
expected. When used thoughtfully, moving text directs attention, paces
storytelling, and creates delightful interactions that make interfaces
feel alive. 

 THE DESIGNER'S GUIDE TO PROMPTS AND MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most designers write ineffective AI prompts, often requesting
"beautiful buttons" without providing precise specifications or
detailing every pixel unnecessarily. This guide recommends specific AI
models based on work type, independence needs, quality requirements,
and access preferences for context. Best practices include starting
with design problems, providing context, leveraging AI beyond coding,
and communicating design intent.
