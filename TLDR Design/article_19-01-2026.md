 APPLE TESTING NEW APP STORE DESIGN THAT BLURS THE LINE BETWEEN ADS
AND SEARCH RESULTS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple is testing a new App Store search ad design on iOS 26.3 that
removes the blue background from sponsored results, making ads look
almost identical to organic results except for a small “Ad” label.
This will likely increase ad clicks and revenue, but it makes it
harder for users to quickly tell what's paid versus real. 

 REPLIT'S AI CAN BUILD YOUR MOBILE APPS AND PUSH THEM STRAIGHT TO APP
STORE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mobile Apps on Replit is an AI tool that builds complete mobile
applications from plain English descriptions and handles payment
integration via Stripe. It can publish apps to the Apple App Store
within days. Replit is reportedly seeking a $9 billion valuation.
However, AI-generated apps often contain security vulnerabilities,
such as missing brute-force protection, because the AI prioritizes
functionality over safety measures. 

 HIGGSFIELD RAISES $80M ON $1.3B VALUATION TO SCALE AI VIDEO PLATFORM
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Higgsfield Inc. secured $80 million in extended Series A funding at a
$1.3 billion valuation to expand its AI video platform for commercial
advertising, marketing, and music videos. The startup, founded in
2023, has grown to 15 million users. It generates 4.5 million videos
daily, reaching a $200 million annual run rate, with 85% of usage from
social media marketers. Its browser-based platform uses AI-powered
video reasoning to maintain temporal consistency across clips,
enabling creators to produce cinematic-quality content without
traditional equipment or expertise.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 IS DESIGN BECOMING TOO SAFE? (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many brands are retreating from bold rebrands and leaning into
nostalgia as a “safe” strategy that feels familiar and trustworthy
amid political and economic uncertainty. Backlashes like Cracker
Barrel's failed modernisation and Vera Bradley's abandoned refresh
show how quickly change can trigger outrage, pushing brands to
preserve beloved heritage elements rather than risk radical
reinvention. 

 HOW UX DIRECTLY IMPACTS P&L (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX is a value multiplier: it determines how much of a product's
potential users can actually access. When people accept bad UX because
the solution matters, improving it becomes a growth lever. However,
when UX blocks users from reaching value, it directly kills adoption
and revenue. The smartest approach is to stay lean at first, watch
where users struggle, and then use design to remove only the barriers
that truly limit business value. 

 THE NEW BUSINESS CASE FOR DESIGN SYSTEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems now drive business revenue, customer loyalty, and
strategic growth rather than serving merely as tools for visual
consistency. Companies like Freshworks and SAP tie design system
impact to customer metrics, achieving results such as 28% lower
service costs, while teams at Hyundai and Grammarly use systems to
enable global scaling and report 25% time savings. Organizations
increasingly measure design system value through customer outcomes,
internal productivity, and strategic alignment, with leaders like SAP
elevating systems to board-level KPIs.

 FIGMA'S PUSH IT CAMPAIGN FOCUSES ON THE HAND IN HANDCRAFTED (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Figma's “Prompt it. Then push it.” campaign for its AI tool Figma
Make used vibrant graphics and human gestures to show AI as something
creatives actively shape, not just a “magic button.” Launched
globally in late 2025, it positioned creativity as applying taste,
iterating, and pushing beyond defaults, with community-made work later
used to show what's possible. 

 WHEN BACKLASH STRIKES, BRANDS SHOULD THINK LIKE ARTISTS (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Brands facing backlash should adopt an artist's mindset, maintaining
their conviction in their vision rather than retreating to please
everyone. Nike's Colin Kaepernick campaign, Coca-Cola's Share a Coke,
and the NFL's Bad Bunny halftime show demonstrate how brands responded
to criticism with clarity and cultural purpose instead of fear. The
key is participating in culture with strategic intention while staying
grounded in brand identity, treating backlash as inevitable rather
than letting it define the work. 

 HOW TO KEEP DESIGN STRATEGIC WHEN YOU'RE SUDDENLY IN A STARTUP
ENVIRONMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Designers in companies that have shrunk to startup size face constant
pivoting and pressure to deliver faster with smaller teams, making
traditional UX processes like personas and journey maps quickly
outdated. The solution is focusing on lightweight use cases—simple
strategic statements that capture who the user is, what problem they
face, why it matters, and the proposed solution. Use cases provide a
North Star for decision-making, allowing teams to evaluate whether
features serve validated user needs and maintain strategic alignment
even as priorities shift.
