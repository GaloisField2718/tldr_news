 MICROSOFT IS REDESIGNING THE WINDOWS BSOD AND IT MIGHT CHANGE TO
BLACK (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft is testing a redesigned Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) for
Windows 11 that ditches the classic blue background, sad face, and QR
code for a cleaner, more modern look—possibly switching to black.
The new version, now in test builds, still includes error details but
aligns better with Windows 11's design and aims to get users back up
and running faster. It's not final yet, but this marks the biggest
visual change to the BSOD since the sad face was introduced in Windows
8.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE DISINFECTING OF DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern design has become overly sanitized to reduce risk, leading to
safe, incremental products that lack creativity and innovation. To
restore design's potential, we must embrace exploration, take
calculated risks, and challenge pre-validated, low-risk processes that
stifle groundbreaking ideas. 

 I CHOOSE OPTIMISM – WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO LOSE? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Optimism and bold ideas can drive meaningful transformation amid
economic uncertainty. The success of companies like Wild demonstrate
how creativity and sustainable innovation remain commercially viable
and prove that new ideas can break through and shape the future. 

 CAN WE ACTUALLY DESIGN FOR SUSTAINABILITY? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX design affects internet emissions and climate change, making
sustainable practices essential. Designers can create eco-friendly
products without compromising usability by reducing media energy use,
minimizing data consumption, optimizing user journeys, and promoting
sustainable behavior.
