 NETFLIX STARTS USING GENAI IN ITS SHOWS AND FILMS (1 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Netflix has begun incorporating generative AI into its original
productions. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently revealed that the first
AI-generated final footage appeared in the Argentine show, "El
Eternauta," in a scene involving a building collapse. The AI-created
scene was completed 10 times faster and at lower cost than traditional
visual effects methods would have required. Beyond production, Netflix
is expanding its use of AI across personalization, search, and
advertising. It plans to launch interactive ads later this year. 

 POLAROID JUST DROPPED THE MOST ICONIC ANTI-AI AD OF THE YEAR (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Polaroid has launched a powerful anti-AI campaign to promote its new
Flip camera, emphasizing the value of tangible, real-life experiences
over digital saturation. The campaign uses nostalgic Polaroid imagery
paired with provocative slogans like “AI can't generate sand between
your toes” to highlight the emotional depth and authenticity of
analog living. Strategically placed near tech hubs like Apple and
Google offices, the campaign has resonated widely online, drawing
praise for its aesthetic and timely critique of tech culture. 

 FIGMA ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING ROADSHOW (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Figma launched its IPO roadshow, offering 12.5 million new shares,
plus 24.6 million from existing stockholders, at a price range of $25
to $ 28 per share. The design platform company applied to list on the
NYSE under the ticker "FIG" with significant investment banks leading
the offering. Figma won't receive proceeds from existing stockholder
sales, while underwriters have a 30-day overallotment option for
additional shares.

 AFRAID OF LOSING YOUR DESIGN JOB TO AI? THIS MCDONALD'S STORY MIGHT
HELP YOU SLEEP BETTER (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fears that AI will replace creative jobs echo earlier anxieties about
McDonald's touchscreen kiosks, which were expected to eliminate human
roles but instead led to more jobs and higher sales by enhancing the
customer experience. The key takeaway is that technology doesn't
determine outcomes—organizations do. Design studios that use AI to
amplify human creativity, not just cut costs, will thrive. 

 DESIGNING SOFTWARE FOR AI AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI agents increasingly handle computing tasks but struggle with
software designed for humans, creating opportunities to redesign
systems for machine use. Web search APIs limit results and provide
condensed snippets suited for human scanning, while agents could
benefit from more comprehensive results and larger document summaries.
AgentDB exemplifies agent-first design by utilizing UUIDs for instant
database creation, storing databases as files rather than hosting them
as services, and integrating with MCP servers to make data easily
accessible as AI model context. 

 AI TOOLS + AI FLUENCY + HUMAN ADVANTAGE = AI-NATIVE DESIGNER (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product designers can thrive in the AI era by mastering three key
areas: leveraging AI tools for faster shipping, developing AI fluency
for designing probabilistic systems, and harnessing human advantages
such as craft and creative direction. While AI handles routine tasks
and generation, designers must evolve into orchestrators who provide
vision, set constraints, and make high-level decisions that guide AI
outputs. The future belongs to AI-native designers who combine
technical literacy with uniquely human skills like strategic thinking,
storytelling, and the ability to create memorable experiences that
transcend generic AI outputs.

 IMPACT STORIES: HOW BLOOM REPOSITIONED GINSTERS (2023) (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 By 2022, Ginsters faced a perception problem: widely recognized but
associated with low quality and outdated imagery, it struggled to
attract new customers despite a strong sales history. A strategic
rebrand by Bloom in 2023 revitalized the brand through updated design,
storytelling, and a more confident tone, resulting in major sales
growth, improved brand perception, and successful product innovation
aimed at younger audiences. 

 HOW SEMANTICS AND ARIA ATTRIBUTES SUPPORT ACCESSIBLE DESIGN (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Accessibility issues stem from missing semantic meaning rather than
visual problems, as elements may look correct but fail to communicate
their purpose to assistive technologies. Proper semantics using HTML
elements, consistent ARIA design patterns, and appropriate attributes
work together to create interfaces that screen readers and keyboard
users can navigate effectively. Comprehensive accessibility audits
must test beyond visual appearance to ensure semantic roles match user
expectations and that interactive elements behave predictably for all
users. 

 DESIGN TOKENS FOR LINKS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Design systems face an architectural challenge when organizing
hyperlinks within token structures, as links occupy a unique position
between atomic elements that can exist independently or integrate into
complex components. Two approaches emerge: treating links as semantic
tokens (reusing text category tokens for flexibility and reusability)
versus specific tokens (creating dedicated link namespaces for clarity
and explicit purpose). The choice depends on system complexity, with
semantic tokens being better suited for scalable systems that support
multiple themes, while specific tokens work well for simpler systems
with clearly differentiated link behaviors.

 WHY MENUS ARE DISAPPEARING IN MODERN UX (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Traditional menus are disappearing from modern interfaces as
