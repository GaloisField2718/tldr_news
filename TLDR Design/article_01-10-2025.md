NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE'S “G” GETS A BRIGHTER LOOK (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google is updating its signature "G" logo company-wide with a
brighter, four-color gradient design that was initially introduced for
Google Search earlier this year. The refreshed icon retains Google's
iconic four colors while incorporating more vibrant hues and gradient
effects to symbolize AI-driven innovation and creative energy. The new
design represents Google's evolution in the AI era and will roll out
across products, platforms, and services in the coming months. 

 INSTAGRAM TESTS REDESIGN FOCUSED ON REELS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instagram is testing a redesign in India and South Korea where Reels
becomes the main page, Stories stay on top, and navigation is adjusted
to include a Following tab with All, Friends, and Latest feeds. The
swipe-based interface makes it feel more like TikTok. Meta stresses
it's only a limited experiment for now. 

 ADOBE PREMIERE FOR IPHONE NOW AVAILABLE – FREE WITH CATCHES (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe has launched Premiere for iPhone, a free mobile version of its
pro video editor that offers multi-track editing, AI-powered audio
tools, Firefly generative effects, and seamless export to social
platforms. Designed for creators and social content, it can be used
standalone or alongside Premiere Pro on desktop, though advanced
features and extra storage require Adobe credits.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BRINGING FIGMA MAKE TO THE CANVAS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma now allows users to copy designs directly from Figma Make
previews into the design canvas as editable layers, eliminating the
need for export steps and enabling seamless collaboration. The company
purchased the technology behind the html.to.design plugin from
divRIOTS to enhance this functionality after observing community
adoption patterns. This "Copy design" feature transforms AI-generated
outputs into dynamic building blocks that teams can iteratively refine
from prototype to production. 

 AI WON'T REPLACE DESIGNERS BUT IT WILL REDEFINE DESIGN (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AI design tools excel at generating variations and handling
repetitive tasks, but lack the contextual understanding, strategic
thinking, and human-centered problem-solving that define professional
design work. Rather than replacing designers, AI is creating a
collaborative model where machines handle mechanical execution while
humans focus on strategy, user empathy, and creative direction. The
most valuable designers of the future will be creative strategists who
leverage AI capabilities while providing the irreplaceable human
insight that transforms generated content into meaningful,
purpose-driven solutions. 

 DESIGN AT SCALE ISN'T FLASHY – BUT IT'S THE MOST INTERESTING WORK
IN THE ROOM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design at scale focuses less on flashy visuals and more on building
adaptable, user-centered systems that billions rely on daily,
balancing consistency with flexibility across cultures, devices, and
contexts. Designers at companies like Grammarly, Google, and Landor
stress collaboration, experimentation, and inclusivity, showing that
scalable design is both highly creative and crucial for shaping
resilient, human-centered products and systems.

 DESIGN ATTRACTORS (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design system specialists face potential obsolescence as artificial
intelligence develops the ability to synthesize "design attractors"
— stable solutions, such as accessible button contrast ratios, that
emerge naturally from usability constraints. AI systems already
understand fundamental design principles without explicit instruction
and could eventually gather organizational requirements to create
self-organizing design systems. While current AI lacks the accuracy
needed to manage complex human expectations, the evolution toward
trustworthy AI-driven design automation may eventually eliminate the
need for dedicated design system roles. 

 PICCALIO UNVEILS NEW BRAND IDENTITY: FROM TOYS TO TIMELESS FURNITURE
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Piccalio has rebranded to reflect its evolution from
Montessori-inspired toys to timeless, multifunctional children's
furniture that balances playfulness with modern design. The refreshed
identity emphasizes natural materials, sophisticated colors, and
“kid forward, design forward” pieces meant to be proudly
integrated into family homes rather than hidden away. 

 BEYOND INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY: RETHINKING AI STRATEGY IN PRODUCT
TEAMS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A UX designer's thesis explored how generative AI is reshaping
collaboration between designers and developers. Findings show AI
speeds up individual work but rarely improves teamwork, augments
rather than replaces skills, and is widely adopted without clear
strategy. The study concludes that AI highlights the importance of
strong collaboration frameworks and calls for moving from fragmented,
individual use toward team-wide, structured adoption with shared
practices, training, and governance.
