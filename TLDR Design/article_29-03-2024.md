(1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Amazon has introduced a new iOS and Android app that allows users to

 GETTING OUT OF MEETINGS AND INTO FOCUSED WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 It's common for creatives to spend their entire day in meetings with
little time for creativity or thought. Don't feel bad about declining
meetings - just remember they do not work. Consider their value to
customers. Schedule meetings for your goals and build your social
connections beyond meetings. 

 ON DEDICATION AND LOVE FOR THE INVISIBLE WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Craft and strategic thinking are often seen as opposites in the
industry, but you can be strategic and still deliver well-crafted,
polished, and thoughtful work. Craft usually best suits focused groups
with the same vision who care about what's being made. However, if
viewed as a critical value by the company's executives, craft can
scale and be integrated into team structure and processes. 

 ARE YOU STOPPING ONE STEP SHORT OF DRIVING CHANGE THROUGH USER
INSIGHTS? (8 MINUTE READ) [15]

analysis while communicating insights, providing a more profound
understanding by interpreting the data, offering context, and
suggesting actionable next steps. This helps persuade teams to make
meaningful changes and how designers should use data to design
meaningful changes and stop constantly ‚Äúputting out fires.‚Äù
