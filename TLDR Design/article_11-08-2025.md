READ) [5] 

 Pinterest CEO Bill Ready stated during Q2 earnings that agentic
shopping, where AI agents purchase items for users, remains far off.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THINK TWICE BEFORE ADOPTING THE AI LABEL (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Integrating AI into product design means reshaping team dynamics and
user experiences, and it requires technical skills. AI is seen as an
accelerator that blurs traditional roles, demands structured and
scalable design approaches, and requires designers and PMs to deepen
technical expertise to thrive in a rapidly evolving environment. 

 DESIGN SYSTEMS AND AI: WHY MCP SERVERS ARE THE UNLOCK (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 MCP servers unlock AI-powered design workflows by giving AI agents
design system context to produce relevant, on-brand output. Figma's
Dev Mode MCP server brings design context to IDEs, enabling AI to
generate code aligned with existing patterns and standards. This
creates a flywheel where AI strengthens design systems while design
systems power better AI code generation and workflow efficiency. 

 AUTOMATING DESIGN SYSTEMS: TIPS AND RESOURCES FOR GETTING STARTED (15
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems encompass tokens, components, workflows, and
documentation that teams use to build consistent products, but keeping
everything synchronized becomes challenging as projects grow. Smart
tooling and automation through platforms like Figma, Supernova, and
Token Studio can streamline token extraction, component syncing, and
documentation updates. Breaking automation into smaller steps, testing
outputs regularly, and leveraging AI assistance helps teams focus on
design rather than manual maintenance tasks.

 PEOPLE ARE ONLY JUST REALISING THE TRUE MEANING OF THE BMW LOGO (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The BMW logo's blue and white segments come from the Bavarian flag,
reflecting the company's origins, not a spinning propeller as often
claimed. The propeller myth began in BMW's own 1920s–40s ads, which
superimposed the logo over aircraft propellers to highlight its
aviation roots. 

 HOW STUDIO FREIGHT LAUNCHED PERPLEXITY'S BROWSER BEFORE IT EXISTED (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Studio Freight designed Perplexity's Comet launch site and campaign
as an abstract, cosmic-themed preview of the browser's possibilities,
using space as a metaphor for exploration and curiosity rather than
sci-fi spectacle. The team blended AI-generated visuals, archival
footage, and seamless video transitions with elegant typography to
create a scrollable narrative, moving quickly through daily iterations
to balance concept, beauty, and emotional resonance. 

 MICROSOFT'S REAL AI CHALLENGE: MOVING PAST THE PROTOTYPES (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Microsoft consistently identifies major technological shifts early
and creates impressive prototypes, but then loses momentum while
competitors advance. The company's pattern repeats with AI - early
Bing Chat success gave way to ChatGPT and other competitors pulling
ahead. Microsoft is now attempting to transform Copilot into a life
companion, though its track record suggests another potential missed
opportunity.
