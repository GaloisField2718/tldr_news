NEWS & TRENDS

 FRAMER ON-PAGE EDITING 2.0 (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Framer's updated On-Page Editing allows editors to rearrange content
like text, frames, and components directly on the page, while
designers can lock specific layers to maintain control. The feature
now includes faster visual updates via one-click swaps of icons and
component variants, plus full Localization support for real-time
multilingual editing. Teams can also reposition the Edit button to
avoid content overlap and manage email notifications for individual
projects. 

 FORMER AMAZON EXECS RAISE $15M FOR AGENTIC COMMERCE STARTUP THAT USES
AI TO GENERATE CUSTOM STOREFRONTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Spangle AI, a Seattle startup founded by former Amazon executives,
raised $15 million in Series A funding at a $100 million valuation to
develop AI-powered technology that generates customized storefronts
for online retailers based on traffic sources and shopping context.
The platform adapts product selection and layout without relying on
user history. Early enterprise customers, including REVOLVE and Steve
Madden, have reported conversion increases up to 50% in the company's
first nine months of operation. 

 "VIBRANT, DYNAMIC, AND CONTEMPORARY": HOW THE LOOK OF THE OLYMPIC
WINTER GAMES MILANO CORTINA 2026 WAS CREATED (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Milano Cortina 2026 design team—led by Raffaella Paniè—is
shaping a brand that balances Olympic tradition with a vibrant,
contemporary “Italian spirit” across everything from logos and
posters to mascots, torches, and medals. The identity focuses on being
dynamic, colourful, and modern while subtly reflecting heritage, often
by simplifying designs and ensuring every element fits a coherent
visual narrative.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY EXPERIENCE INNOVATION IS THE NEW BRAND MOAT (25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Omnicom's merger with IPG in December 2024 eliminated roughly 4,000
jobs, marking a structural shift from promise-based branding to
experience-driven value delivery. Three technological
capabilities—contextual utility at scale, irreversibly shifted
consumer expectations toward problem-solving over values alignment,
and transparent markets that expose promise-delivery gaps—have
rendered traditional advertising-era brand building obsolete. Brands
now compete across products, ideas, and services, where service
delivery has become the decisive factor that earns cultural authority,
creates behavioral dependency through integrated utility, and
generates compounding advantages. 

 VIBE CODING WITHOUT SYSTEM DESIGN IS A TRAP (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-assisted coding tools excel at building functional features
quickly but often create technical debt by hardcoding values, skipping
testing infrastructure, and ignoring future flexibility unless
explicitly instructed otherwise. Successful vibe coding requires
upfront systems thinking—asking questions about configurability,
data sources, dependencies, and change management—before prompting
AI to build anything. Without intentional architecture decisions,
progressive feature additions compound problems through inconsistent
logic, unhandled edge cases, and fragile structures. 

 WALKERS GETS BIGGEST LOGO CHANGE IN 80 YEARS (AND I'M ON BOARD) (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Walkers has revealed its biggest logo redesign in 80 years, replacing
the crisp-shaped symbol with a modern, sun-inspired logo that aligns
it more closely with Lay's in the US. The change, the first major
update since 1998, coincides with a new Hot Honey flavour and may hint
that Walkers wants to expand beyond just crisps.

 EXPLORING NEUROADAPTIVE UX FOR NEURODIVERSE AND MARGINALIZED USERS
(10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Neuroadaptive UX uses AI and brain-signal technology to create
interfaces that respond in real time to users' cognitive and emotional
states, particularly benefiting neurodiverse and marginalized
populations who struggle with traditional one-size-fits-all designs.
Systems can automatically simplify layouts during high cognitive load
and adjust the difficulty in learning platforms based on attention
signals. While promising for accessibility and personalization,
neuroadaptive technology raises significant ethical concerns around
privacy and data handling that require transparent user consent, clear
communication about adaptations, and robust security measures. 

 AI UX RESEARCH: ARCHITECTS OF HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 UX researchers are transitioning from studying static interfaces to
becoming architects of human-AI collaboration, actively shaping
technology's future as AI rapidly integrates. A critical misalignment
exists: 41% of AI investment targets areas workers don't want
automated, leaving researchers to bridge the gap between technical
feasibility and genuine human needs. The field is evolving toward
skill rebundling across collaboration modes—from assistive AI to
orchestrated sensemaking—with researchers leveraging distinctly
human strengths like boundary spanning, problem reframing, and
organizational catalysis. 

 THE CLEVER WAY STANDARD PROJECTS SOLVED THE PARADOX OF BRANDING
INVISIBLE WORK (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Great post-production is meant to be invisible. Standard Projects
built Microdot's new brand identity from the hidden technical language
of filmmaking—edge codes, timecodes, grain, and editing
tools—making the craft feel authentic and visible without breaking
the illusion. The restrained, monochrome system and “Rendering
Imagination” positioning show how a deep understanding of a client's
world can create a distinctive identity that supports the work rather
than overshadowing it.
