 ADOBE ADDS NEW AI-POWERED IMAGE-EDITING FEATURES TO PHOTOSHOP (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe rolled out new AI-powered image-editing features to Photoshop
using its Firefly models, including generative upscaling, object
blending, and enhanced object removal. The Generative Upscale feature
enhances images up to 8 megapixels, while Harmonize helps blend new
objects into scenes by adjusting lighting and colors. The improved
object-removal tool now focuses specifically on removing objects and
filling gaps with an appropriate background rather than considering
the entire scene. 

 INTRODUCING RUNWAY ALEPH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Runway's Aleph is a state-of-the-art in-context video model that
enables comprehensive editing, transformation, and generation of video
content. The system performs multi-task visual generation, including
adding or removing objects, changing camera angles, modifying
lighting, and applying style transfers. Early access will begin with
Enterprise and Creative Partners, and broader availability is planned
for all users soon. 

 LEAKER SHARES CLEAREST LOOK YET AT ALL THE IPHONE 17 DUMMY UNITS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Recent leaks, including a new image from reliable leaker Sonny
Dickson, offer the clearest look yet at the iPhone 17 lineup's color
options, revealing bold new shades like navy blue and orange for the
Pro models—a departure from Apple's typically muted tones. The image
also shows expected colors for the iPhone 17 Air and regular models,
with options like light blue, light pink, and light gold, giving users
a good idea of what to expect ahead of the official launch.

 TOP 10 UI ANNOYANCES (41 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jakob Nielsen identifies common usability problems as expensive
business failures rather than minor user complaints. The analysis
covers ten specific UI annoyances plus six additional issues that
frustrate users daily. These design flaws compound over time, causing
user abandonment and lasting damage to brand trust. 

 PROMPT BUILDING USER INTERFACES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI products struggle with discoverability as most interfaces are
empty text fields that don't help users understand capabilities or
achieve optimal results. Bench is an agent workspace for teams that
evolved from role-based prompt suggestions to atomic, combinable
suggestions that can be stitched together through a task builder
interface. This prompt-building approach clarifies product
capabilities, surfaces new functionality, rewrites prompts for better
outcomes, and guides effective task completion. 

 IT'S NOT YOU: YOUR UX DESIGN JOB IS FRUSTRATING AND UNFULFILLING (17
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX designers, despite working in high-paying, respected roles, often
face alienation through rigid Agile processes, performance metrics,
and extreme task specialization that limit their autonomy, creativity,
and connection to their work. Instead of crafting holistic, meaningful
experiences, designers are frequently reduced to optimizing isolated
UI elements, leading to stress, a loss of fulfilment, and
disconnection from their human potential.

 VIBE CODING: NOT WORTH THE RISK? (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Recent security breaches at Tea, a dating app, and Replit's AI coding
platform expose the dangers of rapid, AI-assisted "vibe coding"
development. Tea exposed 72,000 user images, including government IDs,
in publicly accessible databases, while Replit's AI agent deleted
production data despite explicit freeze orders. The incidents reveal
how prioritizing speed over security in democratized coding tools
creates catastrophic vulnerabilities that harm real users. 

 WHY I THINK V0 IS A GREAT PROTOTYPING TOOL FOR DESIGNERS (9 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Vercel's v0 excels at rapid prototyping by bridging traditional
design-development handoff gaps through realistic, interactive code
generation. The GenUI tool creates functional prototypes in minutes
but requires precise prompting techniques to prevent unwanted
modifications during iteration. This technology shifts designers from
artifact creators toward system directors who guide AI-generated
interfaces and focus on user experience strategy. 

 WITHOUT CREATES NEW BRAND FOR SLEEPOVER AIRPORT NAP PODS (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Design studio Without developed the new visual and verbal identity
for “Sleepover”, a global airport service offering travelers
restful spaces like nap pods and flexi-cabins, replacing the more
utilitarian “Sleep n' Fly” brand to create a more emotionally
engaging and scalable experience. With playful mascots, a calming
purple palette, and a name aimed at turning airport stress into
comfort, the identity is designed to stand out in chaotic terminals
while feeling approachable and universally understandable.
