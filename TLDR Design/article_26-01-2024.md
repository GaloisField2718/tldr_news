OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 TRUST THE PROCESS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The team behind many branding and graphic design works at Smith &
Diction shares their process in this article. They start with
introductions, proceed to the proposal, take care of the contract and
deposit, do the discovery work, use mood boards, start work on
identity design and brand work, present their work, ask for feedback,
and roll it out. 

 DESIGN BOOM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designing with seniors in mind is becoming more critical than ever,
considering that 20% of the U.S. population will be 60 or older by
2029. Unlike previous retirees, this new generation is more
comfortable adopting technology. As designers, we have the opportunity
to empower and make a difference to so many of these users, who are
often unknowingly or intentionally overlooked as marginal cases or
outliers. 

 IMPROVE YOUR LOGO DESIGN SKILLS (2 MINUTE READ) [10]

 LOOKING BACK ON 40 YEARS OF MACINTOSH (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Those who buy Macs spend the money because they plan to use them,
often for many years. The reuptake of ports on computers aimed at
professionals, keyboards that don‚Äôt seem to break from using them,
and three revisions of the Mac Pro in five years leave the impression
that Apple is again willing to meet its users a little closer to where
they are. 

 DIXONBAXI OVERHAULS THE CW WITH CLEAN SIMPLICITY AND BURSTS OF COLOR
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The CW recently removed the ‚ÄúThe‚Äù from its logo. Now, we see the
broader branding concept where the CW logo extends into a ‚Äústage‚Äù
shape. The new typeface, a sans-serif F37 Bolton, complements the
branding nicely and achieves the premium and deadpan aesthetic that
DixonBaxi was after. 

 ARE DESIGN SYSTEMS A ZERO-INTEREST RATE PHENOMENON? (4 MINUTE READ)
[16]

user interface over one-off solutions and maintenance nightmares,

especially given the time and resources required.
