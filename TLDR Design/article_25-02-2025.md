OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNERS MUST GET BETTER AT UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Designers must embrace difficult conversations to overcome industry
challenges like sustainability, technological disruption, and
diversity. By fostering curiosity, empathy, and the courage to ask
uncomfortable questions, the design community can move beyond
complacency. Avoiding these conversations only hinders progress and
deepens existing issues. 

 MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION DESIGN: SECURITY MEETS USABILITY IN UI/UX
DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MFA (multi-factor authentication) enhances security while maintaining
usability. This article explores various authentication methods,
including passwords, 2FA, OTPs, biometrics, and passkeys. It provides
best practices for designing secure, user-friendly authentication
experiences, such as enforcing strong passwords, limiting login
attempts, and educating users about security measures to improve
overall UX. 

 HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN THROUGH AI-ASSISTED USABILITY TESTING: REALITY
OR FICTION? (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Unmoderated usability testing allows participants to complete tests
independently, offering flexibility and broader reach. However, it
lacks real-time moderator interaction. AI-driven follow-up questions
aim to bridge this gap, but research shows limitations in generating
informative, non-repetitive queries. While AI enhances qualitative
insights, it risks frustrating participants with redundant or
irrelevant prompts.
