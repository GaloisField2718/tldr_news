NEWS & TRENDS

 SORA 2 WATERMARK REMOVERS FLOOD THE WEB (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's Sora 2 video generator includes a visible watermark on all
generated content, but multiple websites can remove it in seconds. UC
Berkeley professor Hany Farid calls this predictable, noting that
watermark removal tools appear within hours of AI model releases and
that competitors will inevitably launch models without safeguards.
While experts agree that watermarks are a bare minimum requirement,
they emphasize the need for broader solutions, including AI-social
media company partnerships, upload-side detection systems, and
OpenAI's aggressive response to users circumventing their protections.

user-created skills for tasks like summarizing, fact-checking,

for Dia. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES ITS AI VIBE-CODING APP OPAL IN 15 MORE COUNTRIES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google expanded Opal, its AI-powered no-code app builder, to 15 new
countries, including Canada, India, Japan, Brazil, and Singapore,
after seeing unexpectedly sophisticated creations from US users. The
tool enables users to create mini web apps from text prompts,
customize them with a visual workflow editor, and then publish and
share them online. Google also rolled out performance improvements
that reduce app creation time, add step-by-step debugging
capabilities, and enable parallel execution of multiple workflow
steps.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY DESIGNERS ABANDONED THEIR DREAMS OF CHANGING THE WORLD (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Design, once envisioned as a transformative force to improve lives
through modernist principles of efficiency and social purpose, has
been co-opted by capitalism into a marketing tool that drives
overproduction and waste. The profession now splits between young
designers creating activist statements that highlight global crises
without offering solutions, and celebrity designers who transform
themselves into brands through superficial collaborations and
installations. Despite widespread awareness of the planetary crisis
and design's complicity in it, the field has retreated into impotence,
abandoning its ethical mission to change the world in favor of
performative gestures and spectacle. 

 DECENTRALIZING QUALITY (38 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Decentralized quality management creates more resilient organizations
than centralized approaches relying on executive mandates and top-down
control. While companies like Ford and Apple under Steve Jobs achieved
short-term results through visionary leadership, such approaches prove
brittle when leadership changes. Toyota's andon system, Valve's flat
structure, and Microsoft under Satya Nadella show how empowering
workers to identify and solve quality problems builds lasting
competitive advantages. The future belongs to organizations that embed
quality deeply into their systems rather than depending on heroic
leaders to will excellence into existence. 

 HOW SKYSCANNER TRANSFORMED ITS DESIGN CULTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 At Frontify's Paradigms conference, Skyscanner's Ross Mawdsley and
Carla Sandhu shared how they rebuilt the company's design culture by
empowering teams, fostering ownership, and leading with empathy and
transparency. They emphasized autonomy, collaboration, and trust over
rigid control, arguing that good leadership means understanding
people's nuances, communicating clearly, and balancing creativity with
data-driven perspectives across the organization.

 PROVOKING THROUGH PROTOTYPES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A provotype is a prototype designed to provoke reactions and
stimulate new thinking rather than test usability, dialing up
strangeness and difference to challenge norms. Fashion designers
frequently use this approach with exaggerated runway pieces that
eventually influence mainstream designs, while product and service
designers might create radical "what if" visions around AI, data
access, or user interactions. However, provocation isn't always
appropriate—some teams or topics require trust-building first, and
certain sensitive subjects need trauma-informed approaches rather than
deliberately unsettling prototypes. 

 WHEN TO USE MODAL VS DIALOG COMPONENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Modal dialogs block all page interaction and force immediate
attention, making them suitable for critical actions like confirming
deletions or collecting required information. In contrast, non-modal
dialogs allow continued interaction with underlying content, making
them better for supplementary information or optional settings.
Developers should prioritize keyboard accessibility, proper contrast
ratios, and clear escape routes, while avoiding overuse of modals to
prevent workflow disruption and user frustration. 

 WHY BRANDS ARE GOING CUSTOM WITH TYPE (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Custom typefaces have shifted from luxury to necessity, becoming key
to how brands express and unify their voice across platforms. Studio
DRAMA's Frankie Guzi notes that bespoke fonts boost recognition,
storytelling, and long-term savings compared to licensed ones. With
faster, simpler processes and AI tools, custom type is now seen as a
practical, ownable asset that strengthens brand identity and clarity.
