 THIS NEW EMOJI IS ALL OF US IN 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new iOS update introduces eight new emojis, but the standout is
“Face With Bags Under Eyes,” which perfectly captures the
collective exhaustion of 2025. With droopy eyelids, dark circles, and
a deadpan expression, this emoji resonates with overworked teachers,
burnt-out workers, and tired parents alike. Already making waves
online, it's being hailed as the unofficial symbol of modern-day
burnout and is expected to become one of the most used emojis of the
year. 

 CHATGPT'S IMPROVED IMAGE GENERATION IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR FREE (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT's new viral image generator, known for Studio Ghibli-style
recreations, is now available to free users with limits. Powered by
GPT-4o, its rollout was delayed due to demand. OpenAI recently raised
$40 billion, reaching a $300 billion valuation, marking the largest
funding round for a private tech company ever. 

 HERE'S THE SWITCH 2'S HOMESCREEN (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nintendo has revealed a glimpse of Switch 2's home screen, which
closely resembles the original Switch UI with only minor aesthetic
tweaks. While there's no confirmation of customization features like
those on PlayStation or Xbox, a dark mode option will likely return.
Although the UI wasn't the focus of its recent presentation, Nintendo
did highlight the console's upgraded specs, new features, and preorder
details ahead of its June launch.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 “IT'S NOT EASY” – DESIGNERS RECKON WITH ECONOMIC PRESSURES (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The design industry is under financial pressure as rising costs,
increased taxes, and cautious client behavior create uncertainty.
Industry leaders are noting tighter budgets and a slowdown in hiring.
Despite these challenges, many professionals emphasize the importance
of collaboration, demonstrating the value of creativity and staying
adaptable to meet changing client needs in a shifting economic
landscape. 

 HOW TO ARGUE AGAINST AI-FIRST RESEARCH (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Relying solely on AI-driven "synthetic" user testing can create
misleading insights lacking customer context. AI should enhance, not
replace, traditional UX research, which remains essential for
understanding user needs and behaviors. 

 DO WE REALLY NEED ICON BOUNDING BOXES? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Bounding boxes ensure consistency but complicate the pixel-perfect
design. Issues like excessive padding and loose gaps arise, requiring
overrides. Alternative sizing approaches, such as height-based
bounding or inherent width sizing, may improve scalability. Fixed
sizes help accessibility but should be defined by the wrapper, not the
icon.
