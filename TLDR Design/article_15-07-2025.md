 APEX DOMAINS AND CUSTOM SUBDOMAINS IN FIGMA SITES (1 MINUTE READ) [4]


 Figma Sites has introduced support for apex domains and custom
subdomains, providing more URL personalization options. Users can now
connect root domains to their Figma Sites, with optional redirects
between apex domains and www subdomains. The platform also enables
custom subdomains such as yourname.figma.site for easier integration
with existing domains. 

 IKEA IS LAUNCHING NEW SMART HOME PRODUCTS, AND THEY'RE DESIGNED TO BE
EXTRA EASY TO USE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ikea announced it will release 20 smart home products in January
2026, marking its most significant step toward making smart home
technology open, simple, and affordable. The system centers around
Dirigera, a Matter-compatible hub that works with devices across
different brands to lower barriers for consumers entering smart home
technology. Two preview Bluetooth speakers are launching before the
main release - Nattbad this month and Blomprakt in October - signaling
Ikea's minimalist yet attractive design direction for home tech. 

 FOLLOWING YOUTUBE, META ANNOUNCES CRACKDOWN ON ‘UNORIGINAL'
FACEBOOK CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has announced a crackdown on unoriginal content on Facebook,
targeting accounts that repeatedly repost others' videos, photos, or
text without adding meaningful originality. The company has already
removed 10 million impersonator profiles and penalized 500,000
accounts for spammy behavior, and says creators who abuse reposting
will face monetization loss and reduced reach. This move follows
similar efforts by YouTube and comes amid criticism over Meta's
automated enforcement issues and the rise of low-quality AI-generated
content.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOU PROBABLY JUST TOOK ON SOME UX DEBT (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UX debt accumulates when design teams make compromises due to tight
deadlines, limited resources, or a lack of user research, much like
technical debt in development. This debt manifests as inconsistent
interfaces, poor user experiences, and navigation issues that
eventually require costly fixes and refactoring efforts. While UX debt
cannot be completely avoided, teams can manage it through conscious
decision-making, regular user research, early designer involvement,
and maintaining dedicated backlogs for debt repayment tasks. 

 PESSIMISM PLAYS A CRUCIAL PART IN DESIGN (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While design thrives on optimism, ignoring pessimistic
perspectives—especially in high-risk projects—can lead to
catastrophic failures, as seen in disasters like OceanGate and
Grenfell. Integrate “wildcard thinking” into design processes to
challenge blind faith, encourage preparedness, and balance hope with
realistic scrutiny. 

 I THINK A LOT OF THE ISSUES IN THE INDUSTRY STEM FROM ‘BAD
MANAGERS' (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 "Accidental managers" are skilled creatives pushed into leadership
roles they never wanted. Career progression shouldn't be tied
exclusively to management. Explore alternative paths, seek support
roles to bridge team dynamics, and consider leadership training only
if it aligns with personal goals. Staying hands-on should remain a
valid and respected career choice.

 NOTES FROM A PRODUCT DESIGN VIBE CODING HACKATHON (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Intercom's product design team used AI tools to rebuild its Design
website during a hackathon in London, creating a canvas-style
experience in just over a day. The team discovered AI's limitations
when tools like Lovable confidently claimed to implement features like
draggable blocks and scrolling that didn't actually work. They
switched to Cursor for better control, refined the design iteratively,
and launched an MVP that won the hackathon despite imperfections. 

 HOW TO DEVELOP AGENCY: THE NUMBER-ONE CAREER SKILL FOR THE AI AGE (16
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Human agency, the ability to initiate, decide, and lead rather than
wait for instructions, will become a critical career skill as AI
handles routine tasks. While AI excels at execution, humans must
provide direction and make strategic decisions about what problems to
solve and which AI-generated options to pursue. Developing agency
requires taking initiative at work, treating AI as a partner rather
than a replacement, and building influence through persuasion, skills
that can be cultivated through practice and supportive environments. 

 DESIGNING SCROLL BEHAVIOR: WHEN TO SAVE A USER'S PLACE (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Failing to save scroll position can frustrate users by forcing them
to repeat actions, increasing interaction cost, especially on long or
complex pages. While preserving scroll position is usually best, the
ideal behavior depends on context, content freshness, and user intent.
Designers should aim for the least disruptive default, which often
involves combining scroll memory with visible reset options.
