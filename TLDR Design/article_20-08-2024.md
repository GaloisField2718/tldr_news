 UX IS DEAD. LONG LIVE UX (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The end of "free money" has led to a correction in overhiring and a
focus on sustainable business models, contributing to a "SaaS Winter"

sizes, and drive innovation despite an oversupply of designers from
boot camps and accelerated programs.

to disruptions in their established mental models and cognitive
biases, such as the Familiarity principle and anchoring bias. Adapting

originality, the line between practice and self-promotion, and the
double standards within design culture.
