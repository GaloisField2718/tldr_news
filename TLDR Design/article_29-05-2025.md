 RABBIT TEASES REDESIGNED R1 UI AFTER DESIGN GOD JONY IVE DUMPS ON AI
GADGETS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Rabbit unveiled a redesigned, card-based UI for its R1 AI gadget,
incorporating more colorful and whimsical elements to align with its
vision of a Tamagotchi Pokédex walkie-talkie. The update follows
criticism from former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who called current
AI gadgets like the R1 inferior while collaborating with OpenAI on his
own device. Rabbit continues to position the R1 as a playful, toy-like
alternative to smartphones, aiming to maintain momentum as competitors
like Humane's Ai Pin struggle.

READ) [5] 

 To celebrate its 10-year anniversary, Google has redesigned the
Google Photos editor, bringing previously Pixel-exclusive AI tools to
more users. The update includes Reimagine, which lets users modify
photo elements using text prompts, and Auto Frame, which provides
smart cropping and framing suggestions via generative AI. Additional
features include AI Enhance for multi-effect edits, contextual tool
recommendations, and QR code album sharing. The rollout begins on
Android next month and on iOS later this year. 

 ONE OF EUROPE'S TOP AI RESEARCHERS RAISED A $13M SEED TO CRACK THE
‘HOLY GRAIL' OF MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A leading European AI researcher and former Synthesia co-founder has
launched SpAItial, a startup developing foundation models that
generate interactive 3D environments from text prompts. Backed by a
$13 million seed round, the company has assembled a team of former
Google and Meta researchers with 3D experience. SpAItial aims to build
realistic, responsive 3D worlds, with a long-term goal of enabling a
10-year-old to create a video game in 10 minutes using just text.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CONSISTENCY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Consistency in design is less about rigid sameness and more about
creating predictability, reliability, and familiarity that respects
users' time, aids usability, and scales effectively. Real consistency
comes from principles, not just patterns, allowing space for
innovation, clarity, and delight while building trust and identity
over time. 

 HOW TO CREATE A DESIGN SYSTEM CHANGELOG (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creating a design system changelog helps teams stay organized and
aligned by documenting updates, additions, and removals. It improves
communication and reduces errors for designers, developers, and
product managers. A structured format with categories like Added,
Changed, and Deprecated enhances usability, accessibility, and
consistency. Including templates and contextual links further
clarifies each change. 

 STRONGER DESIGN PRINCIPLES START WITH ONE QUESTION: ‘VERSUS WHAT?'
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 To write effective, enforceable design principles, they must be
opinionated and specific enough to spark meaningful debate early in
the process. Asking “versus what?” helps test whether a principle
is genuinely guiding or just a vague compromise, encouraging teams to
align around intentional choices rather than defaults.

 DESIGNING CALM: UX PRINCIPLES FOR REDUCING USERS' ANXIETY (12 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 User experiences can significantly affect emotional well-being. Poor
design can cause unnecessary anxiety. Thoughtful UX can ease stress
through clear feedback, intentional pacing, and subtle interface cues.
Reducing digital anxiety requires shifting focus from speed to clarity
and recognizing the emotional impact of design. By addressing
emotional friction, designers can build trust and boost user
confidence. 

 BEHIND THE SCENES: HOW WE ITERATE ON UI COPY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Automattic's designers treat UI copy as a core design element,
addressing it from the first draft through rapid iterations. They
improve user understanding and accessibility by prioritizing clear,
concise language. Their internal Figma plugin, Wordmattic, helps
explore text variations quickly without disrupting the design process.
Embracing the “write as you design” principle, they advocate for
writing as a tool to shape more effective interfaces. 

 CREATIVE BRANDING: BIKE FOR BRAIN HEALTH VISUAL IDENTITY (3 MINUTE

branding across posters, signage, and digital platforms create an

the cause.
