 JONY IVE AND SAM ALTMAN'S FIRST AI GADGET MAY TRY TO KILL AIRPODS (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Jony Ive and Sam Altman are reportedly developing an AI-powered audio
device that resembles an earpiece that sits behind the ear rather than
inside it. The gadget, expected around September, will feature a 2nm
chip and ChatGPT voice assistant capabilities to replace iPhone
actions through Siri commands. While details remain unclear, there is
skepticism about whether the device will be able to differentiate
itself from popular wireless earbuds like AirPods, which already offer
similar functionality.

 NEW GRAMMY CATEGORY TO AWARD CREATIVES BEHIND THE BEST ALBUM COVER OF
THE YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Grammy Awards introduced a new Best Album Cover category for
2026, honoring art directors rather than performers for their visual
work. This year's five nominees include Bad Bunny's Debí Tirar Más
Fotos, Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia, and three other albums, with

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNERS AS AGENT ORCHESTRATORS: WHAT I LEARNT SHIPPING WITH AI IN
2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI-assisted building in 2025 enabled designers to ship products
without extensive coding knowledge. Designers excel at orchestrating
AI agents because their core skills translate directly to effective
prompting and product development. The progression involves four
phases: moving from accepting all AI outputs to hypothesis-driven
debugging, then to systems thinking with comprehensive documentation,
and finally to knowing when to ship rather than endlessly optimizing. 

 AMBIENT AI IN UX: INTERFACES THAT WORK WITHOUT BUTTONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Ambient AI enables interfaces that operate proactively in the
background, using contextual signals like location, behavior patterns,
and time to anticipate user needs without requiring explicit commands
or button clicks. Unlike traditional reactive AI features that wait
for user input, Ambient AI continuously monitors and adapts. Designing
these systems requires balancing automation with user control,
maintaining transparency through subtle cues, and ensuring actions
remain predictable and reversible to build trust. 

 WHY PRODUCT PRIORITIZATION BREAKS — AND THE DIMENSION MOST TEAMS
MISS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Product teams get stuck on prioritization because they measure
customer impact well but treat OKRs as a weak proxy for business
impact, making trade-offs subjective when multiple initiatives look
equally valuable to users. A better approach is to score opportunities
on two independent axes—customer impact and business impact—and
prioritize where both are high, making strategic trade-offs explicit
and adaptable as company priorities change.

 I'M NOT A ROBOT: WHY SHOWING YOUR WORKINGS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE
IMPORTANT (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Audiences increasingly demand proof that creative work is human-made
rather than AI-generated, making behind-the-scenes content essential
for brands and creatives to demonstrate authenticity. This
transparency trend echoes the Arts & Crafts movement's response to
industrialization, as creators now showcase their manual processes,
labor, and decision-making to reclaim value in the AI age. Beyond
marketing, sharing creative processes educates audiences, builds
trust, fosters community among creatives, and validates that
meaningful work requires human judgment, experimentation, and care. 

 LEGO PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE 40+ YEAR JOURNEY OF APPLE CALCULATOR DESIGNS
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple's calculator designs evolved over 40+ years from the 1984
Macintosh GUI version to today's iOS interface, reflecting the
company's broader design journey through functionality, skeuomorphism,
and minimalism. A fan-made LEGO set with 821 pieces recreates four key
stages of this evolution, showing the transition from the
Jobs-approved black-and-white original, through OS X updates, to the
modern circular-button design influenced by Dieter Rams' Braun
aesthetic. The modular desk display concept is currently on LEGO
Ideas, where supporters can vote to turn it into an official product.

heritage that creates community, supports rotating merchants, and lets
independent identities thrive within a shared framework.
