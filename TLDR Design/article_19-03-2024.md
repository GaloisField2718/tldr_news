Headspace, Meta, and Nexus Studios. It targets Gen Z users to
strengthen their mind-body connection and alleviate loneliness.

 A DESIGNER‚ÄôS ROLE IS NOT ‚ÄúAT THE TABLE‚Äù (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 For decades, designers have asked for a seat at the table in the
boardrooms where decisions are made. Yet, this seems next to
impossible, given that the people sitting next to them often struggle
to understand their role. Instead of trying to prove their value and
explain design, designers should invite those who don‚Äôt understand
their role to experience design. 

 COLOR IS A FOUR LETTER WORD (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When used effectively, color has the power to capture a viewer's
attention. Today's software is mostly a canvas for displaying people's
(colorful) content, so you cannot rely on color alone to guide their
behavior. You should remove colors from interface design whenever
possible, treating them as part of a budget only used where it returns
the best results.

 PRODUCT TOOLS HAVE CREATED A LEADERSHIP CRISIS. ONLY TOOLS FROM THE
OUTSIDE CAN SOLVE IT (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tech has an unhealthy relationship with tools: we use them to define
our goals. However, the problem with most tools is that they succumb
to ‚Äúthe way of ways‚Äù and eventually replace the goal entirely. The
cause of the problem is the lack of leadership necessary to define
goals beyond ‚Äúfollow the book.‚Äù
