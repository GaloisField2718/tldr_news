 MIDJOURNEY DEBUTS NEW V1 VIDEO GENERATION MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Midjourney has launched its V1 video generation model, which creates
clips up to 21 seconds long by animating existing AI-generated images.
Users can customize video length, motion levels, and animation style
through prompts, with the service automatically extending initial
5-second clips. The company positions V1 as a building block toward
developing interactive 3D simulations following the recent release of
its V7 image generator. 

 WELCOMING PAYLOAD TO THE FIGMA TEAM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma acquired the team behind Payload, a popular open-source
headless CMS and application framework, to enhance developer tools
across both platforms. Payload will remain open-source while
contributing to Figma's upcoming CMS for Figma Sites, which will
combine powerful backend customization with intuitive content
management. The acquisition supports Figma's vision of becoming a
central hub for digital product creation, bridging the traditional gap
between design and development workflows. 

 SHUTTERSTOCK REBRANDS AS IT GOES ALL-IN ON GENERATIVE AI (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Shutterstock has rebranded to reflect its evolution from a stock
image provider into a full-scale creative partner, embracing roles in
ad production, generative AI, and model training for companies like
OpenAI and Google. The sleek new identity—featuring updated
typography, a broader color palette, and a redesigned
logo—underscores its growing ambitions and commitment to removing
creative friction for businesses through AI-powered tools like its new
Generative AI Pro tier.

 HERE'S WHEN YOU SHOULD CHANGE A LOGO, ACCORDING TO THE LEADER BEHIND
WALMART, BURGER KING, AND UBER REBRANDS (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Subtle rebrands are becoming increasingly popular as major brands
like Amazon, Walmart, and Adobe evolve beyond their original
offerings, focusing on refining brand systems and architecture rather
than overhauling core logos. These updates often involve just as much
strategic and creative effort as full rebrands, aiming to maintain
recognition while improving flexibility, consistency, and emotional
resonance across expanding touchpoints. 

 EVERYONE'S A 10X EMPLOYEE NOW. BUT AT WHAT COST? (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI tools have transformed workplace expectations, making "10x
employee" performance the new standard while eliminating traditional
learning opportunities for newcomers. Entry-level roles now require
senior-level judgment as companies automate foundational tasks,
leaving new designers with fewer chances to develop crucial
decision-making skills through gradual experience. While AI
accelerates output and capabilities, it cannot replace the slow,
iterative process of building creative judgment from hands-on practice
and proximity to experienced professionals. 

 WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU'D CHANGE ABOUT THE DESIGN INDUSTRY? (8

from ending free pitching and improving pricing frameworks to valuing
the design process and writing better briefs. Their visions emphasize
elevating design's strategic role, fostering kinder discourse,
encouraging creative risk-taking, and reclaiming space for
experimentation and meaningful work.

 DREAMY ANIMATED ARCHITECTURAL “SKETCHES” BROUGHT TO LIFE WITH AI
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 EMUNARQ architecture studio created an animated series called
"Fluidity in Form," featuring dreamlike architectural sketches that
blend polished areas with pencil sketch elements. The renderings
showcase organic, curved forms inspired by spatial harmony and
movement. These flowing designs control pedestrian traffic through
gentle walkways and appear influenced by Zaha Hadid's curved
architectural style. 

 BRAND BROTHERS' IDENTITY FOR MICRO-ROASTERY DATURA BLENDS TENSION,
INTUITION, AND TYPOGRAPHIC CHARM (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brand Brothers created a bold, typography-led identity that balances
sophistication with an alternative edge for Paris-based micro-roastery
Datura, intentionally avoiding literal visuals to preserve the brand's
mystique. Drawing on intuitive design processes and rhythmic
letterform experimentation, the branding combines a refined logo, the
rugged-yet-graceful Tor Grotesk Bold typeface, and a rich, organic
color palette, reflecting both creative freedom and a close, trusting
client collaboration. 

 AVOIDING UX MALPRACTICE (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 UX teams often treat symptoms—like low conversions or user
confusion—with their favorite tools without properly diagnosing the
true root of the problem. Using Jesse James Garrett's five-layer model
(strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface) as a diagnostic
framework helps identify where issues truly lie, ensuring the right
methods are applied to resolve them effectively instead of masking
deeper issues with superficial fixes.
