 GOOGLE LAUNCHES WORKSPACE STUDIO TO CREATE AUTOMATED GEMINI-POWERED
AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Workspace Studio is a no-code automation tool that enables
users to create AI agents powered by Gemini 3 to handle tasks across
Gmail, Chat, Drive, and other productivity apps. The agents use
natural-language prompts and can perform sentiment analysis, content
generation, and intelligent prioritization by reasoning through
problems rather than rigid rules. Workspace Studio is rolling out to
Business, Enterprise, and Education tier customers over the coming
weeks. 

 APPLE DESIGN BOSS ALAN DYE DEPARTING FOR META (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Alan Dye, Apple's Human Interface Design chief since 2015, is leaving
for Meta to lead a new design studio focused on hardware, software,
and AI. Apple veteran Stephen Lemay will take over his role. While
some commentators argue Dye's departure won't meaningfully affect
either Apple or Meta, it comes during a period of major leadership
turnover at Apple, including recent exits by key executives and
ongoing shifts as the Tim Cook era winds down.

 DIGITAL TWIN MODELING: A VISION OF AN AI FUTURE WITH UX AT THE HELM
(7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital twin modeling—systems that create real-time behavioral
models to predict and adapt to user actions—offers UX designers a
concrete framework for working with AI, addressing the current
confusion around "UX in AI." Unlike vague interpretations of AI design
work, digital twins enable continuous learning from user behavior
patterns. Learning digital twin modeling requires mastering
data-informed design fundamentals first, then progressively building
systems that identify behavioral patterns, automatically adapt
experiences, and eventually predict user needs before problems arise. 

 IN THE SEA OF SAMENESS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern digital design has become increasingly homogeneous due to
frameworks like Tailwind and design system templates, which prioritize
efficiency over creative authenticity. The shift from craft-focused
design to metrics-driven product development, combined with formulaic
portfolio structures that reduce design to "problem-solving," has
diminished the designer's role and unique voice. Designers need to
reconnect with personal taste and intuition, creating space for
authentic self-expression that goes beyond imitation and
trend-following. 

 THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 User research relies on human expertise, judgment, and
context-gathering skills that AI cannot replicate. While AI can assist
with tasks like pattern recognition or transcription, outsourcing
entire research plans, interviews, or synthesis risks producing
average results, devaluing the profession, and misleading
organizations into thinking they are truly user-focused. Maintaining
professional standards and preserving the uniquely human aspects of
research is essential, resisting the temptation to trade expertise for
efficiency or hype-driven AI adoption.

 TAKING STOCK AFTER A CHALLENGING YEAR: HOW CREATIVES PLAN TO MOVE
FORWARD IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 UK creatives reflect on a turbulent year marked by economic
uncertainty, sharing lessons from navigating inconsistent workloads,
self-doubt, and shifting expectations. Across designers, illustrators,
and strategists, common themes emerged: be proactive rather than
overthink, embrace slow periods for intentional growth, protect your
own pace, lead with authenticity, keep your work documented, and stay
connected to community. Ultimately, persistence, clarity, and
self-trust prove to be the most valuable takeaways heading into 2026. 

 STUDIO LOTTA NIEMINEN'S SOPHISTICATED BRAND IDENTITY FOR ERLY LEANS
ON EXQUISITE COLOUR COMBINATIONS AND A CONFIDENT LOGO (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 A decade after shifting from illustration to running her own graphic
design practice, Lotta Nieminen and her studio have created a refined
yet playful identity for Erly, a clean skincare brand focused on
personalisation. Centered on a logo inspired by the circular motion of
blending skincare products, the system uses soft, merging letterforms,
confident scaling, sophisticated muted tones paired with neons, and an
adaptable typographic toolkit to balance elegance with approachability
across packaging and digital touchpoints. 

 UNSPOKEN AGREEMENT DESIGNS SKINMETAL WITH YOUNG MEN AS CO-FOUNDERS (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Skinmetal's brand identity was co-created with teenage boys, who
acted as decision-making collaborators rather than traditional focus
group participants, shaping a product and messaging that genuinely
resonates with its audience. The packaging, colour palette, and
typography balance industrial functionality with emotional
authenticity, while campaigns focus on empowerment and everyday
relevance rather than fear-based health messaging, reflecting a design
process rooted in collaboration, respect, and real-world insight.
