 THE FUTURE OF UX IS HERE, AND IT'S FULL OF GENERALISTS (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The future of UX is shifting from specialization to resourceful
generalists, driven by shared human-centered culture, accessible
playbooks, AI-powered tools, and role consolidation. UX teams can lead
this transformation by fostering a learning, teaching, action, and
adaptation culture. 

 EIGHT DESIGN BREAKTHROUGHS DEFINING AI'S FUTURE (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Key AI design breakthroughs include conversational interfaces
(ChatGPT), source transparency (Perplexity), creative workflows
(Claude Artifacts), voice input, deep workflow integration, ambient
assistance (Grok Button), and process transparency (Deepseek). These
innovations redefine human-AI interaction, shaping more intuitive,
efficient, and trustworthy digital experiences for the future. 

 DO YOU TRUST DESIGN ADVICE FROM CHATGPT? (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ChatGPT confidently provides design advice but lacks context, nuance,
and rationale. Its suggestions prioritize aesthetics over usability,
making it unreliable for interface design. Instead, designers should
develop critical thinking, follow research-backed principles, and
recognize bad advice. Trusting informed sources and personal research
leads to better design decisions than AI-generated recommendations.
