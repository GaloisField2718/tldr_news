 FROM BETA TO BEDROCK: BUILD PRODUCTS THAT STICK (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Many financial products fail by adding features instead of delivering
clear, lasting value through a strong MVP. Success comes from
identifying "bedrock" tasks users care about and making those
experiences simple, dependable, and trustworthy. Long-term growth
depends on maintaining a clear mission, prioritizing simplicity,
iterating based on real feedback, and resisting the urge to
overcomplicate.

Colosseum to modern digital interfaces, always focused on enhancing
human experiences. In the digital era, UX became a strategic
discipline shaping entire products, emphasizing usability, emotional
impact, and business alignment. Yet, it often struggles in
organizations due to limited resources and misunderstandings about its
true value.

 WHAT DESIGNERS WISH THEY'D KNOWN ABOUT RUNNING A BUSINESS (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Starting a design business takes patience to find your voice, courage

 THE AI QUALITY COUP (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The rise of viral Ghibli-style AI art has sparked debate about what
defines quality art today. True artistry is about novelty, rarity, and
skill—not just copying. While AI offers personalization and new
ideas, lasting quality still depends on deep narratives, emotional
connection, and real human effort. Pushing creative boundaries beyond
what technology can easily replicate remains essential. 

 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS A CREATIVITY ENGINE (5 MINUTE READ) [14]

and inspiring ideas. If used wisely, AI can be a valuable
collaborator, not a threat, and has great potential in education,
design, and innovation. AI serves as a powerful accelerator of
creative processes. The human spark remains essential.
