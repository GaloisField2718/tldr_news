SCRAPING (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Over 400 UK creatives, including Paul McCartney and Elton John, urged
the prime minister to back an amendment requiring AI firms to reveal
which copyrighted works they used for training. They argue this would
prevent copyright theft. The government's opt-out proposal is seen as
too weak. Baroness Kidron says UK creative industries should not be
sacrificed to tech companies.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN OR DISAPPEAR (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In this era of fast AI growth, ecological crisis, and cultural
divides, thoughtful design is essential for survival. We face a clear
choice: embrace purposeful design that builds lasting connections or
fall into an “anti CRAFT” approach of complacency and apathy.
There is no middle ground - organizations and individuals must choose
design or risk irrelevance. 

 YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM ISN'T A COMPONENT LIBRARY (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems are more than just component libraries - they are
dynamic frameworks for building digital experiences. Like cities that
grow from essential infrastructure to vibrant neighborhoods, design
systems should provide a flexible, purpose-driven foundation that
encourages creativity and maintains cohesion. 

 WHAT IS THE DESIGN HILL YOU WOULD DIE ON? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A diverse group of designers shared beliefs ranging from user
clarity, emotional resonance, and trust to embracing chaos,
simplicity, and transformation. Each stands by a personal “design
hill,” like “print it out,” “make mistakes,” or “fight for
the guest experience.” These views show design as a craft and
mindset rooted in purpose, emotion, and human connection.
