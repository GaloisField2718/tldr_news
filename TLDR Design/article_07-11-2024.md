jobs, especially as generative AI grows, many clients still prioritize
original, high-quality, human-created work. AI's role in illustration

 GENTRIFIED BY DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The homogenizing effect of algorithms on culture influences what

prepares designers for real-world complexities and compromises in
professional settings.

 THE INTERSECTION OF DESIGN AND PSYCHOLOGY - CRAFTING USER-CENTERED
EXPERIENCES (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design goes beyond aesthetics. Designers can create intuitive,
meaningful experiences by using psychology - cognitive load, color,
typography, and Gestalt principles - to enhance usability. By
understanding user motivations, designers can create interfaces that
fulfill user needs and foster engagement.

Control is ideal for refining content display or navigating categories
within the same view. 

 DO PERSONAS HELP CREATE BETTER DESIGNS? (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 User personas oversimplify audiences, but they provide essential
audience insights. While personas help brands connect emotionally,
some see them as outdated and instead favor psychographic and
AI-generated data. Designers must balance detailed understanding and
flexible, real-world design approaches.
