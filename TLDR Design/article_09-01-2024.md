 CLICKS IS A BLACKBERRY-STYLE IPHONE KEYBOARD CASE DESIGNED FOR
CREATORS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new company called Clicks Technology has announced an iPhone case
with a built-in keyboard on the bottom. Clicks brings the tactility
and precision of a physical keyboard to the iPhone so people don‚Äôt
have to wait until they return to their desks to create or communicate
with the satisfying feedback only actual buttons can provide. 

 THIS CLAIMS TO BE THE ‚ÄòWORLD‚ÄôS MOST ADVANCED PEN‚Äô THAT
DIGITISES HANDWRITING (2 MINUTE READ) [6]

most advanced pen". The Nuwa Pen uses an inbuilt camera system, motion

and integrate them with various apps. 

 THE LEGACY OF INVISION APP (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Three lessons from InVision‚Äôs rise and fall: marketing hype can
only take you so far, teams need to prioritize small wins and
improvements before it‚Äôs too late, and acquiring great companies
instead of catching up with the paradigm shift doesn‚Äôt help.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN BETTER PAGINATION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pagination makes it easier for users to transverse many results by
presenting them in defined amounts per page. Designers should use
numbered representation, truncate page navigation, consider using
‚Äúfirst‚Äù and ‚Äúlast‚Äù buttons, show the count of items per page
on top of long lists, and consider using an infinite scroll. 

 CONSIDERING QUANTITY, QUALITY, AND STABILITY WHEN DELIVERING THE NEXT
GENERATION OF YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Feature quality‚Ää‚Äî usability, accessibility, performance, and
consistency‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästarts high and stays high. The quantity of
completed features resembles an ‚ÄúS curve‚Äù over time, accelerating
gradually before flattening as the launch approaches. Feature
stability‚Ääincreases throughout implementation, but reversals are
common and expected to refactor things already made based on what was
learned. 

 COMPETITIVE USABILITY EVALUATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A competitive usability evaluation looks at how competitors do
things, what's working, and what's not. With it, you can make
objective decisions, reduce risks, improve value-driven design, and
understand different approaches to similar design challenges. The two
methods of conducting these evaluations are competitive reviews, which
involves looking at a series of related products, and competitive
testing, which consists of testing your and your competitors' designs.
