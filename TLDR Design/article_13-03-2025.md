 CONNECTED PROJECTS IN FIGMA (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma's connected projects enable collaboration between separate
teams, like agencies and clients, using their own paid plans. Admins
manage access, security, and libraries, while each team covers its
seat costs. Projects can be connected, shared, or disconnected, with
plan limitations affecting features and the number of connected
projects allowed. Figma plans to launch the new capability in the
first half of 2025.

Using technology from Meta, OpenAI, and Sony's Mockingbird, the AI
replicates speech and expressions. The project remains a prototype,
with no plans for integration into games yet, amid concerns over
industry job impacts.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GREAT SOFTWARE DESIGN LOOKS UNDERWHELMING (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers can use AI to overcome imposter syndrome by generating
meaningful sample content, organizing positive feedback, and
understanding business needs. These approaches help build confidence,
improve iteration, and enhance communication of design impact. 

 AI CAN HELP DESIGNERS BUILD CONFIDENCE TO TACKLE IMPOSTER SYNDROME (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UX designers can tackle imposter syndrome by using tools to enhance
their work, refine ideas, and organize feedback. Instead of fearing
change, they can focus on problem-solving and communicating their
impact. Confidence comes from adapting, staying relevant, and proving
their value in the field. 

 THIS COMPETITION EXPOSED HOW AI IS RESHAPING DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A 45-minute design battle between pro designer Brett Williams using
Webflow and non-designer Henrik Westerlund using AI-driven Lovable
highlighted key shifts in design. Williams won, but Westerlund's
AI-assisted speed made it competitive. The match revealed how AI
impacts design workflows, accelerating production but lacking the
judgment and iterative decision-making of experienced designers.

MINUTE READ) [12]

co-founder James Sommerville featuring a redesigned logo, wordmark,
tagline, and style guide to highlight its mission and heritage. The

 YOU ARE HERE… OR THEY ARE HERE? (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design that prioritizes collective well-being over personal
convenience challenges hyper-individualism. Technology often centers
individuals, but a radical shift embraces diverse needs and community
input. Public services must move beyond personalization, fostering
collaboration for truly inclusive solutions. 

 QUALITY IS NOT MEASURED, IT'S FELT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design quality goes beyond metrics; it's felt through experiences.
Companies like Apple and Airbnb succeed by crafting emotional
connections, not just functionality. True quality arises when design
and strategy align, creating lasting impressions. When businesses
overlook design's long-term value, products may work but lack soul,
failing to build loyalty or connection.
