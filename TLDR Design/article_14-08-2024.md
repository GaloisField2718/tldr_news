 OPERA ONE WITH AI AND ENHANCED DESIGN LAUNCHES ON IOS (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Opera One has launched on iOS with a minimalist design that features
a full-screen browsing experience and an integrated Aria AI assistant
for quick search suggestions and voice input. The browser also
includes a built-in ad blocker, free VPN, customizable themes, and a

 MICROSOFT'S PAINT 3D WAS ONCE THE FUTURE OF MS PAINT, BUT NOW IT'S
GOING AWAY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft introduced Paint 3D in the Fall Creators Update of Windows
10, aiming to replace the classic MS Paint with advanced 3D editing
features. Due to user backlash, the older Paint app was retained and
enhanced with new features, while Paint 3D fell into obscurity. By
November 4, Paint 3D will be deprecated, with users directed to
alternative apps for 2D and 3D editing needs. This deprecation aligns
with Microsoft's recent trend of streamlining and refocusing its
built-in Windows apps.

controls.

 GROWTH AS A JUNIOR UX DESIGNER (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As a junior UX designer, consistently showing up, taking notes, and
following through builds trust while gaining exposure to multiple
projects and teams aids learning and networking. Expanding your role
by contributing to strategy, leading projects, and mentoring others
can help you develop managerial skills and progress in your career. 

 STOP INVENTING PRODUCT PROBLEMS; START SOLVING CUSTOMER PROBLEMS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Focusing on "product problems" instead of "customer problems" can
result in low-value features and poor user experience. To avoid this,
teams should prioritize solving customer problems and desired outcomes
rather than relying on vanity metrics or focusing solely on output
goals. 

 WE DON'T NEED A BOSS, WE NEED A PROCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Effective design does not require a single leader and a skilled,
collaborative team with a shared vision and process. While design by
committee often fails, it's due to the need for trained collaborators,
not the collaboration itself. With the right skills and practice,
teams can collectively create solid, cohesive designs.

MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fast food kiosks enhance the user experience by offering
customization, quick service, and autonomy in ordering. Poorly
designed kiosks can lead to frustration and long wait times. To ensure

 NEURODESIGN: THE SCIENCE BEHIND UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCES (7 MINUTE
READ) [16]
