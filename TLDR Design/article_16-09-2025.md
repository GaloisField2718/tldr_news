NEWS & TRENDS

 RUMOR: SMALLER DYNAMIC ISLAND BUT NO UNDER-SCREEN FACE ID FOR IPHONE
18 (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The iPhone 18 is rumored to debut a slimmer, narrower Dynamic Island,
marking its first design change since the iPhone 14 Pro. While it
won't yet adopt under-screen Face ID or a hidden front camera, the
refined shape would make the cutout less visually dominant. This
adjustment pushes Apple closer to its all-screen design goal and
offers a cleaner look that frees up more space for both the display
and status bar. 

 HIGGSFIELD: $50 MILLION SERIES A RAISED TO TRANSFORM AI VIDEO
CREATION (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Higgsfield.ai raised $50 million in Series A funding led by GFT
Ventures to advance its AI video creation platform. The company has
gained 11 million users and 1.2 billion social media impressions in
five months since launch, outpacing competitors with its
Click-to-Video technology that creates cinematic clips with a single
click. The funding will support enterprise platform expansion, team
growth, and accelerated market strategy in the $600 billion short-form
video market. 

 MIDJOURNEY'S STYLE EXPLORER V1 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Midjourney launched an early version of its style explorer that
features thumbnails that show prompts rendered with different SREF
codes sampling from the continuous latent space of styles. Users can
save their preferred styles, try out styles with custom prompts by
hovering, and use fuzzy search to find styles matching descriptors
like "photographic" or "anime." The tool allows rapid style
experimentation by applying different visual aesthetics to the same
prompt across multiple variations.

 EVERYONE WANTS A FASTER HORSE. WE AIM TO PLEASE (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perception often shapes value and experience more strongly than
objective improvements. Since user-reported data is biased and
incomplete, blending attitudes, behaviors, and latent knowledge offers
deeper insights. Examples like Starbucks' handcrafted image,
eco-friendly dish soap, and GE's playful MRI rooms show how subtle,
perception-driven design can create more meaningful and empathetic
outcomes. 

 WHY JAGUAR'S RIGHT TO STICK TO ITS CONTROVERSIAL REBRAND (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Jaguar's controversial rebrand, launched with bold concept cars in
striking colors, deliberately distanced the brand from traditional
buyers to target a younger, wealthier, design-focused audience. While
sales have dipped, Jaguar is embracing exclusivity with cars priced
over $130,000. It claims that rising interest among high-income and
younger consumers is proof that the polarizing strategy is working. 

 LESSONS LEARNED IN AI AND DESIGN WORKFLOWS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Dropbox product designer shares insights from experimenting with AI
tools like Figma Make and Cursor. They found that while these tools
show promise, the gap between design and engineering remains
significant. AI tools actually expose design system weaknesses rather
than hiding them, making strong foundational systems more critical for
successful implementation. The key to meaningful AI adoption lies in
having internal champions who provide resources and support for
experimentation. Critical thinking remains essential, as AI outputs
still lack crucial context about product strategy and user insights.

 SEVEN IPHONE AIR DETAILS YOU MIGHT'VE MISSED (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple's new iPhone Air pushes design into ultra-thin territory but
comes with notable trade-offs. Its Dynamic Island sits deeper into the
display to accommodate packed components, the USB-C port is
off-center, and the phone uses a single rear camera and mono speaker,
giving it a more minimal—but compromised—look. These changes
create a sleeker silhouette overall, but at the cost of symmetry,
audio fullness, and advanced camera design.

campaign proves that well-timed humor combined with genuine values can
turn a competitor's misstep into a major growth opportunity. 

 HOW LEADING AGENCIES ARE NAVIGATING THE NEW ERA OF BRAND STORYTELLING
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Three leading agency executives discussed how modern brand
storytelling has evolved beyond traditional content creation to become
an integral part of brand building across multiple channels and
formats. Agencies are evolving from simple content creators to
strategic partners, collaborating closely with increasingly capable
in-house teams. They focus on modular content systems that serve
business objectives rather than just creative expression. AI should be
embraced as a creative enhancement tool that accelerates ideation and
removes barriers, while agencies must also adapt their content
strategies for AI-powered search engines that prioritize clear,
authoritative answers to audience questions.
