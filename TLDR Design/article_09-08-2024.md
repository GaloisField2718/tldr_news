 MAINE'S PROPOSED FLAG LOOKS A LOT LIKE ONE OF ITS OLD ONES. THAT'S
INTENTIONAL (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Maine voters are deciding whether to adopt a redesigned state flag
created by Adam Lemire, featuring the eastern white pine on a buff
field with a navy star. This design, reminiscent of the 1901-1909
flag, symbolizes Maine's 16 counties and was selected from 400
submissions. Maine's current flag, adopted in 1909, displays the
state's coat of arms on a blue field. It is outdated by modern
vexillology standards, which favor simpler, more symbolic designs. The
new design aims to be a unifying symbol, avoiding political
controversy by reviving a historic flag.
