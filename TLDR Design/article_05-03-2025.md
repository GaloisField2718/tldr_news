 THE FIGMA DILEMMA: TOO MANY COOKS, TOO FEW DECISIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Figma made collaboration easy, but too much input can create chaos.
Unchecked editing turns polished designs into a mess, wasting time on
trivial debates. Setting boundaries, limiting editing rights,
structuring feedback, and organizing files restore order. Used wisely,
Figma enables excellent work, but without discipline, it becomes a
recipe for design frustration.

 AND THE BEST MOVIE POSTERS OF THE YEAR ARE... (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Great posters often align with great films, but the Oscars still lack
a Best Poster category. In this post, designers praise this year's
standout posters, including The Brutalist's Bauhaus-inspired design,

 ARRESTING REALITY (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The sublime emerges from vast scales, whether in Rothko's immersive
paintings, towering cities, or John Cage's overwhelming soundlessness.
It transcends visual experience, stirring emotions beyond
comprehension. Taste, shaped by culture and history, defines aesthetic
judgment, while AI challenges artistic originality. In an era of
algorithmic curation, creativity risks homogenization or reinvention.
