 TRIPADVISOR'S NEW LOGO REVEAL JUST MADE ME SPIT OUT MY COFFEE (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 TripAdvisor's new rebrand, created by Koto to mark the company's 25th
anniversary, revives its iconic owl mascot "Ollie" with a more
expressive, traveler-focused design and a warmer, photo-inspired color
palette to emphasize authenticity and emotional connection. Departing
from traditional rebrand announcements, TripAdvisor humorously
unveiled Ollie's redesign via Instagram using parody “cosmetic
surgery” language, successfully tapping into internet culture with a
self-aware, tongue-in-cheek tone. 

 GOOGLE'S NEW GEMINI LOGO FINALLY FEELS PART OF THE FAMILY (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google has updated its Gemini logo to better align with its core
brand identity, replacing the old blue and purple scheme with Google's
signature red, yellow, green, and blue gradient. The redesign retains
Gemini's star-shaped motif but introduces softer, curved points for a
more organic feel, helping it feel less like an isolated AI product
and more like an integrated part of Google Workspace. This subtle yet
impactful change emphasizes the power of color and consistency in
brand cohesion. 

 GOOGLE ROLLS OUT ITS NEW VEO 3 VIDEO GENERATION MODEL GLOBALLY (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has launched its Veo 3 video generation model globally.
Available in more than 159 countries for Gemini users, the model
allows paying AI Pro subscribers to create 8-second videos from text
prompts, with a daily limit of three videos. Google plans to expand
capabilities by adding image-to-video generation features to Gemini in
the future.

 BUILT TO BOUNCE BACK: WHY RESILIENCE IS THE REAL CREATIVE SUPERPOWER
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Resilience in creative work isn't just a personal trait but a
collective strength built through real-world challenges, supportive
leadership, and a culture that values process over perfection. Design
leaders emphasize that true resilience comes from embracing iteration,
making space for rest and perspective, welcoming honest critique, and
building environments where teams can adapt, collaborate, and grow
with purpose. 

 WHY YOU SHOULD STOP COMPLAINING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers should stop complaining about dysfunctional organizations
and leaders, since decades of complaints haven't solved these
problems. Converting complaints into actionable proposals proves more
effective, as well-designed complaints transform into pitches,
arguments, or plans that drive change. Instead of complaining,
designers should pursue three alternatives: seeking power to make
decisions, becoming influential advisors, or developing self-awareness
about their limitations. 

 JOBS-TO-BE-DONE: A STRATEGIC NORTH STAR (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Listerine dominates the mouthwash category by consistently focusing
on one clear Job-to-be-Done: "Kills Germs." Despite evolving from a
floor cleaner to a dandruff cure to a breath freshener, the brand
maintains this core message as its strategic anchor. Brands win when
buyers associate them with clear Jobs-to-be-Done.

 IPHONE 17 PRO MAX VS PRO: HERE'S HOW APPLE WILL DIFFERENTIATE MODELS
(2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max will further distinguish itself from the
iPhone 17 Pro this year by significantly increasing its battery life,
thanks to a thicker design that allows for a larger battery. While no
exclusive camera features are expected this time, the Pro Max's
battery advantage—which already outpaced the Pro—is set to grow
even more, making it the clear choice for users who prioritize
endurance. 

 HOW ATHLETICS DESIGNED A FLEXIBLE MOTION SYSTEM FOR NIKE'S INTERNAL
NORTH AMERICAN DOCUMENTARIES (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Athletics, in collaboration with North Sea Air and Revel, developed a
dynamic and cohesive visual identity system for a Nike film series
using color-coded, custom-doodled sticker tags to represent each
team's unique story while maintaining overall unity. The modular
system—with consistent typography, environment-inspired colors, and
reusable motion elements—enabled vibrant, flexible storytelling
across six diverse narratives, balancing individuality with brand
cohesion. 

 IF YOUR TEAM THINKS THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DESIGN, SAY IT BACK TO
THEM (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Designers can avoid building the wrong products by using "looping for
understanding", summarizing stakeholder requirements back to them in
their own words to confirm comprehension. This technique addresses the
emotional frustration that occurs when stakeholders feel unheard,
while also creating opportunities to identify and resolve
misunderstandings before design work begins. The approach can be
enhanced by framing requirements around user problems rather than
features, helping teams stay focused on solving actual user needs.
