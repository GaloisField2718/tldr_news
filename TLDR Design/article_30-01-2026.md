 NEW GLASS EFFECT UPDATES IN FIGMA (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma's Glass effect is now generally available with expanded
capabilities beyond frames, allowing users to apply it to any object,
shape, or text. The update includes non-uniform corner customization
with precise radius control, as well as a new Splay property for
adjusting light behavior around edges. Users can now apply variables

 HALIDE COFOUNDER SEBASTIAAN DE WITH JOINS APPLE'S DESIGN TEAM (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sebastiaan de With, co-founder of Halide and Lux, is joining Apple's
Human Interface Design team, returning after earlier freelance work on
products like iCloud and Find My. His hire comes during a wider design
reshuffle at Apple following Alan Dye's exit, with Stephen Lemay
stepping in to lead HIG and John Ternus now overseeing Apple's design
teams, prompting optimism about the company's renewed design focus. 

 ANDROID'S FULL DESKTOP INTERFACE LEAKS: NEW STATUS BAR, CHROME
EXTENSIONS, MORE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Android's desktop interface has leaked through a Google bug report,
which revealed a new status bar optimized for large screens with time,
date, battery, Wi-Fi, and other icons. The leak showed the interface
running on an HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook with Android 16, codenamed
"Aluminum OS" (ALOS). The status bar appears taller than in tablet
versions and includes features such as a notification bell, a keyboard
language indicator, a Gemini icon, and a screen recorder pill.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY SO MANY INFO TIPS ARE BAD (AND HOW TO MAKE THEM BETTER) (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Information tips—brief messages triggered by hovering or clicking
icons like "?" or "i"—should provide supplemental context without
hiding essential information or disrupting workflow. Common pitfalls
include wasting time with redundant content, hiding critical
instructions that most users need upfront, and interrupting tasks with
intrusive modals or page takeovers rather than inline guidance.
Well-designed info tips remain short, contextual, and accessible while
keeping crucial information visible at the primary interface level. 

 I TRIED APPLE CREATOR STUDIO TO SEE IF IT'S WORTH THE SUBSCRIPTION
(12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple Creator Studio is a $12.99/month ($129/year) subscription that
bundles ten pro apps for Mac and iPad—deeply discounted for
students—while still allowing one-off Mac purchases, but not on
iPad. The bundle targets serious creators who work across Mac and iPad
rather than iPhone-first editing, with refreshed apps like Pixelmator
Pro offering strong templates, AI tools, and logo/illustration
features, albeit with some brush and workflow limitations compared to
rivals. 

 SHOULD YOU BE PUBLICLY ANTI-AI? CREATIVES SHARE THEIR VIEWS (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Freelance creatives are split on whether speaking out against
generative AI helps or harms their business: some argue that openly
stating ethical concerns attracts like-minded clients who value human
creativity, while others caution that defining yourself as
“anti-AI” can oversimplify a complex issue and risk alienation.
Overall, there's no single right answer—many creatives reject
generative AI for core creative work but accept AI for menial tasks,
agreeing that the most sustainable approach is to act authentically,
clearly communicate what you stand for, and trust that the right
clients will follow.

 Figma now allows Make prototypes to be embedded directly into Figma
Design, FigJam, and Figma Slides, enabling teams to share interactive

 ILLUSTRATING THE GEMINI APP (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's Gemini app uses dynamic gradients, rounded shapes, and
intentional motion to make its constantly evolving AI assistant feel
intuitive and trustworthy. The design team drew inspiration from
Google's circular logo and Material Design elements, creating soft,
directional gradients that visualize Gemini's thinking process and
guide users through interactions. This fluid illustration system aims
to bridge conceptual gaps around AI while maintaining familiarity with
Google's established visual language.

heritage into a bold, geometric ship crest that balances history with
modern youth culture. The new system—spanning crest, typography, and
colors—emphasizes collective play, community pride, and

brand for the club's next generation.
