OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MERGING DESIGN AND COMPUTER SCIENCE IN CREATIVE WAYS (6 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 New projects at MIT explore how AI, AR, and robotics can streamline
design workflows, from voice-controlled furniture shopping to
gesture-based construction tools. These systems aim to make building
more sustainable, accessible, and responsive to real-world needs like
housing and renovation. 

 I HATE MY PORTFOLIO (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many designers find updating portfolios emotionally draining due to
perfectionism, unclear expectations, and self doubt. Balancing
conflicting advice like bold versus minimal, detailed versus concise,
and universal versus tailored makes the task feel endless. This
struggle shows the need for more empathy in the design community,
toward both ourselves and each other. 

 CRAFT AND SATISFACTION (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Satisfaction in craft grows from deep engagement with the process,
not just the outcome. Mastery often means obsessing over inputs. AI
tools risk reversing this, shifting focus to results and distancing
creators from materials. Whether using AI deepens or dilutes our
connection to what we're making is still to be answered.

 AI IS COMING FOR ADVERTISING... BUT IS IT COMING FOR US? (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 AI is reshaping advertising by shifting the focus from human
intuition to data-driven decisions. While it threatens creativity's
role, it also offers time and tools to enhance it. The industry must
apply AI intentionally—supporting, not replacing, human insight.
Creativity, storytelling, and cultural relevance remain irreplaceable
foundations that AI can accelerate but never replicate.
