 AI FOR UX: GETTING STARTED (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers can use AI to increase their productivity, improve the
quality of their work, and enhance their skills. An essential element
in getting full value from AI is to include a heavy dose of human
judgment in the workflow. This is for three reasons: humans must
select ideas suggested by AI, hallucinations can be convincing, and
bias lurks in the training data. To get AI working, designers should
provide ample context in their prompts, ask for multiple options,
iterate on the output, and build a prompt library. 

 5 TIPS FOR GIVING FEEDBACK TO YOUR DESIGNER‚Ä¶ THE CORRECT WAY (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Feedback in the design profession is crucial but often challenging
due to the reliance on remote communication methods like email and
messaging platforms. Constructive criticism requires clear, objective
language and thoughtful expression that cannot rely on tone or body
language, making it essential to choose words carefully. 

 BUILDING INTERACTIVE UX MAPS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Interactions can be applied to high-fidelity UX maps to showcase user
research and further engage with stakeholders. To make the UX maps
easier to consume and more engaging, start with consolidating findings
and data into a low-fidelity map. Then establish a visual design
system, group key elements of your map by theme or type (e.g., videos,
photos), create a structure using auto layout, add the content,
prototype the desired interactions, test, and troubleshoot.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DESIGN SYSTEM CHECKLIST (WEBSITE) [11] 

 With this open-source checklist, you can plan, build, and grow your
design system. 

 AUTOMATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR DESIGN TOKENS (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Specify works as a single source of truth for your design tokens and
assets to facilitate brand consistency and collaboration across teams
and products.

 IN SEARCH OF THE IDEAL PRIVACY ICON (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Icons are capable of enhancing the content that surrounds them, but
they have to be self-explanatory for that to happen. We have icons for
things we like (a thumbs up), things we can share (a box topped with
an up arrow), and even for protection against malicious online attacks
(a shield), but what are the options we have for representing
‚Äúprivacy?‚Äù A padlock, a detective, a Zorro mask, or a shield? 

 THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VISIONARY DESIGNERS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Among designers, a silent wave of standardization has been slowly but
steadily engulfing the essence of our creativity, leading to what has
been poignantly termed "The era of The Vanishing Designer." This
phenomenon encapsulates the systemic shift towards a rigid,
data-driven approach, overshadowing the whimsical charm of individual
creativity that once was the hallmark of the design ethos. 

 CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? DIGITAL DESIGN NOW HAS ITS OWN HISTORY (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Art and design historian Stephen J. Eskilson is releasing Digital
Design: A History, the first book to examine how computer-aided design
has impacted culture and society. Eskilson takes a broad view of
digital practice and outcomes, looking at games, UX/UI, digital
typography, prototyping, and more.

 HOW GRAPHIC DESIGNERS ARE CREATING THEIR OWN AI TOOLS (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Despite AI's ability to produce technically competent designs and
aesthetically pleasing images, it remains based on some median output
dictated by whichever visual data it's been trained on. For creativity
to indeed exist, it requires a greater degree of human involvement,
intent, and authorship on the creator's part. Six designers explain
how they built their own AI toolkits, their approach to using tech,
and how they keep humanity in their work. 

 BREAKING DOWN A DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Follow these patterns to make breaking down a design to get it ready
for development easier: be clear on the outcome and opportunity, do it
at the right moment, be clear on the end-to-end journey, work at the
right fidelity, accept the chunks of work, don‚Äôt get disheartened
when the design is being chopped to pieces, identify releases with
outcomes, design for interim releases, and be prepared to move on even
if the project is 80% complete.
