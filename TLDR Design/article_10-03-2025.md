 META RESEARCHERS GENERATE PHOTOREALISTIC AVATARS FROM JUST FOUR
SELFIES (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta's Avat3r generates photorealistic avatar heads in minutes using
just four selfies. Unlike previous methods, which required extensive
data and processing, it employs a large reconstruction model (LRM)
with a vision transformer to create 3D Gaussians. While not yet
real-time, it marks a step toward effortless avatar creation for VR
users.

phone yet, possibly as slim as 5.5mm. Renders from leakers like Ice
Universe and iDeviceHelp show a design with a 6.6 to 6.9-inch display,
a Google Pixel-style camera bar, and familiar features like Face ID
and a USB-C port. While these leaks provide insight into the potential
design, Apple's September launch event will likely reveal the official
details.

 SCOPE IN GENERATIVE AI FEATURES (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Broad-scope AI handles diverse tasks with flexible inputs and
outputs, like ChatGPT. Narrow-scope AI, such as Spotify's playlist
generator, serves specific functions and enhances usability. Users
often find narrower AI features easier to understand and use. Scope
impacts design, prompting guidance and user interaction, influencing
both functionality and accessibility across applications.

READ) [8] 

 Michael Graves Design champions accessibility, blending style and
functionality to create products for all. Rooted in empathy, it pushes
brands to prioritize universal design from inception, not as an
afterthought. Its “Delight for All” philosophy drives innovation,
proving inclusive design enhances lives while expanding market reach
and business growth. 

 CAN WE FINALLY ADMIT THE TESLA CYBERTRUCK WAS A TOTAL DESIGN FAIL? (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Tesla Cybertruck set out to be a bold, futuristic statement but
fell short as a functional design. Its sharp angles, oversized
proportions, and real-world usability issues like poor visibility and
difficult repairs make it more of a spectacle than a practical
vehicle. While some appreciate its uniqueness, many see it as an
overhyped concept that doesn't deliver on its promises.

 WHY EVERYONE CAN (AND SHOULD) BE A GREAT STORYTELLER (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Anyone can be a great storyteller because writing is just organizing
your thoughts—and like anything else, it gets better with practice,
feedback, and revision. Clear communication is more important than
ever, whether you're an engineer, designer, or product manager,
because good storytelling helps bring ideas to life and get people on
board. The key is starting messy, structuring your thoughts, and
refining until your message is clear and engaging.
