 Microsoft rebranded its office suite from Microsoft Office to
Microsoft 365 and now to Microsoft Copilot 365, which is confusing as
the old name is still referenced. Critics see the change as
unnecessary and part of a broader trend of companies making puzzling
rebrands.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGNING SERENDIPITY (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gesture-based navigation, enhanced by AI, is revolutionizing digital
interactions, reducing cognitive load, and offering personalized
experiences. Serenwikity, an app designed to browse Wikipedia through
AI-powered swipes, fosters serendipitous discoveries while balancing
user control and AI augmentation. This innovation highlights the
evolving intersection of design, development, and AI in modern digital
products. 

 THE GEOGRAPHY OF INTERFACE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Spatial metaphors deeply influence how we navigate and understand
digital spaces by borrowing from physical concepts like desktops and
folders. While these metaphors initially aided digital adaptation,
they may now limit innovation. We can develop more intuitive,
non-physical navigation patterns, enhancing user experience by
learning from game design and creating meaningful digital landmarks
and hierarchies. 

 STOP BUILDING PRODUCTS FOR YOUR IMAGINARY USERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Focus on real users by talking to them, testing frequently, and
solving actual problems rather than relying on abstract personas.
Embrace the chaos of user behavior and iterate based on genuine
feedback to build a product that truly meets their needs.

 TURN ON THE WATER WORKS: WHY EMOTION FUELS CREATIVE BRILLIANCE (11
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 "Forward Thinking 2025" is a manifesto that emphasizes the emotional
depth behind creativity, advocating for human-centered creative
processes amid a data-driven landscape. Lucy Bourton highlights the
importance of emotional connections in artistic endeavors, drawing
from examples like Keith Brymer Jones and Molly Lewis, who integrate
heartfelt expression into their work, enhancing audience engagement. 

 BEYOND ALT TEXT: OVERLOOKED ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES YOU SHOULD BE
USING (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Accessible design goes beyond basics like alt-text and color
palettes. It involves straightforward navigation, color contrast, and
multimedia for inclusivity. Using ARIA roles, captions, and improved
forms enhances user experience. Implementing accessibility features
early in the design process, using checklists, and conducting regular
audits ensures compliance and broader audience reach. 

 THE UX RECKONING: PREPARE FOR 2025 AND BEYOND (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The UX job market has declined, with job postings down to 70% of 2021
levels and regression in UX maturity as businesses undervalue the
field. To adapt, UX professionals should be flexible, build
stakeholder relationships, and balance user and business goals while
embracing AI responsibly.
