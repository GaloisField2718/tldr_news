 JONY IVE'S LOVEFROM REINVENTS THE BUTTON WITH MONCLER (5 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 LoveFrom, founded by Jony Ive, partnered with Moncler on a modular
shell jacket collection featuring a down-filled vest with
interchangeable outer layers. The key to this design is the innovative
"duo button," which uses magnets to seamlessly swap jacket layers,
eliminating the fuss of traditional fasteners. The partnership is also
symbolized in the duo button's design, which features logos of both
brands and fun, cartoon-inspired details inside the jacket. 

 WHY THE DUOLINGO OWL SUDDENLY LOOKS ‚ÄòDISGUSTING' (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Duolingo's owl mascot, Duo, has undergone a controversial redesign.
The owl appears sick with a runny nose, drooping eyes, and sweaty
face. This change is a marketing strategy intended to boost user
engagement by grabbing attention. Despite the alarming new look, the
app and Duo's in-app appearance remain unaffected. Users have had
mixed reactions - some find the latest look creative, while others are
disturbed or confused by the sickly appearance. 

 CONTROVERSIAL OAKLAND AIRPORT REBRAND SEEMS TO BE CONFUSING
PASSENGERS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The rebranding of Metropolitan Oakland International Airport to San
Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport needs to be clarified, as
some passengers are mistakenly heading to San Francisco International
Airport (SFO) instead. Since the name change, SFO has recorded several
incidents of confusion between the two airports, leading to a legal
dispute over trademarks between the two rival hubs. The Port of
Oakland has countersued, arguing that SFO itself isn't technically in
San Francisco, further complicating the situation.
