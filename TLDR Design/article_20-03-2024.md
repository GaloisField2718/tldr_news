AQUARIUM (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Pentagram rebranded Monterey Bay Aquarium for its 40th anniversary.
The rebranding effort created a cohesive new identity that honors the
institution's past and looks to the future with an updated kelp
symbol, typographic harmony, and a broader ocean-inspired color
palette. It streamlined the iconic kelp symbol for scalability,
incorporated typography that echoes the kelp's dynamics, and expanded
beyond traditional blue to include a range of oceanic colors.

 HOW INSIGHT FROM NETFLIX PROFILES DOUBLED OUR CONVERSIONS (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A UX case study of how Gett, a taxi booking platform, leveraged
insights from Netflix to implement a profile selection feature,
significantly improving user experience and doubling business
conversions. The critical takeaway is not solely to seek inspiration
from obvious sources but instead to think outside the box, even within
everyday products that may not be directly related to your product‚Äôs
natural field of activity. 

 INCONSISTENT CONSISTENCY WITHIN DESIGN SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The backbone of design systems consists of coded components, design
libraries, design tokens, and guidance documents, which ensure visual,
behavioral, and semantic consistency. However, consistency outside the
product regarding the user's ecosystem is also possible. Problems can
result when the user's ecosystem is unbalanced against internal
consistency, especially for systems still at an early stage of
maturity. 

 BUSINESS DESIGN SCHOOL: QUESTION STORMING (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Like its more popular counterpart, brainstorming, question storming
revolves around group collaboration to explore a topic from various
angles with one goal ‚Äî generating as many questions as possible.
This technique harnesses the power of curiosity to promote critical
thinking, gain deeper insights, and uncover hidden dimensions of a
problem or topic.

 ARTISTS SELL THEMSELVES SO CHEAP (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Creative people just want to create and don't want to deal with
business, contracts, or lawyers, which makes them especially
vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation. It is precisely because
of this that they get into trouble. 

 PORTFOLIO PRESENTATIONS & DESIGN WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Getting design done requires cross-team coordination, resource
management, and buy-in. However, these aren't things you should focus
on when building a portfolio. Show off the concrete things you've done
and how you did them in your portfolio. Provide insight into how you
make design decisions with a couple of examples. Go through the why at
a high level and then the how at a low level.
