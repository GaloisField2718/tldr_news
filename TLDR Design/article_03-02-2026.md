NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE INTRODUCES PROJECT GENIE VIRTUAL WORLD GENERATOR (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Google's Project Genie is a tool that generates interactive 3D
virtual environments from text prompts using the Genie 3 world model.
Currently available to US subscribers of the $250-per-month Google AI
Ultra plan, the tool renders environments at 1,280x720 resolution and
24 frames per second for up to 60 seconds. Users can customize
avatars, camera angles, and rendering styles. Google has planned
international expansion and potential API access for developers in the
future. 

 THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX—WITH CLAUDE AND FIGJAM (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Figma and Anthropic have integrated Claude into FigJam, enabling
designers, developers, and product managers to generate editable
diagrams directly from AI-generated responses to text prompts, PDFs,
images, or screenshots. The integration helps teams visualize user
flows, system architectures, and project timelines without
copy-pasting, allowing collaborative refinement on FigJam's shared
canvas. Claude can suggest various diagram types—including decision
trees, Gantt charts, and sequence diagrams—making AI a thought
partner that transforms conversations into visual artifacts for
strategic planning and execution. 

 APPLE PLANS CLAMSHELL DESIGN FOR SECOND FOLDABLE IPHONE (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly exploring a second foldable iPhone—a clamshell
“flip” model—to complement an internally prototyped book-style
foldable, following a dual-track strategy already used by rivals. The
flip iPhone would emphasize portability and mainstream appeal,
potentially offering a more accessible entry into foldables while
Apple quietly tests designs, pricing, and iOS adaptations before
committing to release.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 'THE AMOUNT OF AI SLOP WE'RE SERVED IS INCREDIBLE': 5 QUESTIONS WITH
TOM ALLEN (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tom Allen, co-founder and creative director of Buff, explains how B
Corp certification formalized the studio's people-first values and why
thoughtful, brand-specific motion design matters more than ever amid
generic trends and noisy AI use. He sees AI as a double-edged sword
that can elevate craft when used responsibly, and believes staying
relevant comes from clarity of positioning, community presence, and a
distinct, human creative voice. 

 ELIZABETH GOODSPEED ON THE LIMITS OF IMPERFECTION AS A DESIGN
STRATEGY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The current “analogue revival” in design is less about genuinely
handmade processes and more about using the idea of imperfection to
signal authenticity in an era where AI and digital tools make polish
cheap and ubiquitous. Real analogue value wouldn't come from simulated
textures or trend aesthetics, but from changing the conditions of
making—slower timelines, material engagement, and systems that
actually reward visible human labour rather than its performance. 

 WHEN DESIGN STOPS ASKING WHY AND STARTS ASKING, “CAN AI DO IT?”
(9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-driven design workflows are flipping decision order, putting
polished artifacts before strategy and causing designers' core
work—questioning intent, assumptions, and user value—to be seen as
friction rather than leadership, even as speed is rewarded. Data from
Figma shows that while AI boosts efficiency, successful teams are
those that pause after generation to exercise judgment, explore
alternatives, and decide what's worth building at all.

 APPLE'S UNRIVALLED COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE IS FADING – A DESIGNER
EXPLAINS WHY (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Apple's Liquid Glass design faced widespread criticism for poor
usability, including difficult-to-read transparency effects, confusing
animations, and inconsistent visual elements. The problematic rollout
coincided with key leadership departures, including design VP Alan Dye
leaving for Meta, suggesting deeper cultural issues at a company
historically defined by design perfectionism. While fixes are expected
in the March OS 27 update, the pattern of underwhelming user
experience signals Apple's luxury brand status is eroding as it loses
the uncompromising design ethos established under Steve Jobs. 

 RECORDED DESIGN WALKTHROUGHS: THE BEST WAY TO GIVE YOUR DESIGN A
VOICE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Recorded video walkthroughs of prototypes provide crucial context
that design links alone cannot convey, addressing challenges such as
limited meeting time, asynchronous team collaboration across time
zones, and stakeholders' unfamiliarity with design tools. This
approach allows designers to articulate their rationale clearly while
giving stakeholders time to absorb information at their own pace.
Recording walkthroughs also serves as valuable presentation practice
and creates a cohesive narrative that highlights essential details
stakeholders might otherwise overlook. 

 WHY CREATIVE EDUCATION NEEDS A BAUHAUS-SIZED RESET (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Creative education requires a fundamental reset, akin to the Bauhaus
movement, in response to today's systems collapse driven by AI,
climate breakdown, and pervasive anxiety. This shift positions
creative education as society's operating system rather than an
optional extra.

 THE TURING REEL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Runway released research showing that over 90% of 1,043 participants
could not reliably distinguish five-second videos generated by their
Gen-4.5 AI model from real footage, with overall detection accuracy at
just 57.1%. 

 BRAVE NEW WORLD? NEW REPORT WARNS GENERATIVE AI IS ALREADY COSTING
CREATORS THEIR LIVELIHOODS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Association of Illustrators and other creator-led groups have
released “Brave New World?”, a major UK report warning that
unregulated generative AI is already eroding creative livelihoods
through job losses and unlicensed data use, and urging urgent
government action via a new CLEAR framework to protect creators'
rights and ensure fair, ethical AI innovation. 

 APPLE LOSES MORE AI RESEARCHERS, SIRI EXEC TO GOOGLE AND META (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple has lost several more AI researchers and a senior Siri
executive to rivals like Meta and Google DeepMind amid ongoing
internal AI restructuring.
