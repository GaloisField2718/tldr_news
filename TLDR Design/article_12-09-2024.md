 FIGMA HAS ADDED A PDF & JPEG EXPORT QUALITY SELECTOR (1 MINUTE READ)

 Figma has introduced a new export quality setting to give users
greater control over file size and image quality when exporting frames
and images as JPEGs or PDFs. The updated quality menu lets users
choose between High, Medium, or Low quality for JPEG or PDF exports.
Low-quality compresses images the most, resulting in the smallest file
size, while High quality avoids any compression.

ships in an unfolded state, boasting a thinness of 3.6mm at its
slimmest point and a folded thickness of 12.8mm. Hands-on reviews have
highlighted its ability to simultaneously display multiple app windows
and its accompanying phone case, which doubles as a stand. Some videos
reveal visible creases on the display hinges at certain angles, a
common issue with current foldable screens.

education maintain a balance between innovation and sustainable
management.
