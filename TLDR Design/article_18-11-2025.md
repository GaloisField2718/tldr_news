NEWS & TRENDS

 SMITH & DICTION REBRANDS SUPERHUMAN, FKA GRAMMARLY (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Grammarly's rebrand into Superhuman grew from a simple AI-agent brief
into a full transformation after major acquisitions and the launch of
its AI assistant. Smith & Diction created Hero, a simple
character-based logo whose expressive motion helps convey intelligence
and adaptability across the product ecosystem. This flexible identity,
supported by customised typography and deep product integration,
unifies the previously separate brands and strengthens Superhuman's
shift from a writing tool to a broad AI productivity platform, helping
align teams and attract renewed interest. 

 SERVICENOW AND FIGMA LAUNCH STRATEGIC COLLABORATION TO TURN DESIGN
VISION INTO ENTERPRISE TRANSFORMATION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ServiceNow and Figma have launched a strategic collaboration
utilizing MCP technology, enabling developers to transform Figma
designs directly into enterprise-ready applications through
ServiceNow's Build Agent. The integration automates the path from
design to deployment with enterprise-grade security, reducing initial
UI and data model implementation time by over 80%. Users can now
provide a Figma design link as a prompt to the Build Agent, which
interprets layouts and components to automatically generate fully
functional, secure, and scalable applications within minutes. 

 OPENAI IS LAUNCHING GROUP CHATS IN CHATGPT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has introduced group chats for ChatGPT, allowing up to 20
people to collaborate with the AI in a shared conversation. Initially
rolling out in Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, the
feature supports planning and decision-making while keeping group
chats separate from private memory, adds new social behaviors like
emoji reactions, and includes participant and notification controls.
Broader expansion is planned for after the pilot.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FIGMA JUST PROVED EVERYONE (INCLUDING ME) WRONG (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma's 2025 Schema Conference introduced nine major updates,
including extended collections for multi-brand systems, slots for
component customization, and AI-powered design checking, addressing
long-standing design system needs. The announcements mark a
significant shift from previous concerns about Figma neglecting its
design system features, with improvements spanning performance, code
integration through MCP servers and GitHub connections, and native
variable import/export. Variable composability still requires further
development for advanced authoring patterns. 

 HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH AN EXECUTIVE DEMANDING FEATURES? CREATE A
HYPOTHESIS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When executives demand features based on trends, designers should
respond with strategic curiosity rather than compliance or refusal,
using a stakeholder-as-user approach to understand motivations and
context. Designers can justify their questions by estimating the
likelihood that design decisions will impact user behavior, much like
engineers provide development time estimates. Summarizing ideas into
testable hypotheses—"If we [change feature], users will [behavior]
because [rationale], achieving [goal]"—helps expose logical
inconsistencies and may lead executives to reconsider poor decisions
themselves. 

 AFFINITY BY CANVA REVIEW: FREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Affinity by Canva is now a single, completely free app that merges
Designer, Photo, and Publisher into one interface with Vector, Pixel,
and Layout modes, plus optional Canva AI tools for paid users. Setup
is simple and the software retains its strong tutorial support, robust
vector and photo-editing features, non-destructive workflows, and
comprehensive PDF export, while adding downloadable on-device ML
models for tasks like object selection. Despite its refreshed
packaging, it's largely the same Affinity suite users know, with no
major losses, though it still lacks photo cataloguing tools and older
Affinity files convert to a new .af format that legacy apps can't
open.

 BLOOD SUGAR BATTLER: BUILDING A REAL GAME AS A DESIGNER USING AI (19
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Alex Pierce built Blood Sugar Battler, a mobile diabetes education
game, over the course of three months, utilizing the AI tool
Lovable.dev for coding while hand-crafting all visual and audio
elements. The retro-styled game challenges players to tap falling
foods within 60 seconds, managing both score and a blood sugar meter
that reacts differently to healthy versus processed foods. Pierce
handled all creative decisions—pixel art sprites, vintage macOS
interface design, sound effects, and gameplay balancing—while using
AI to translate design intent into functional code. They learned that
AI excels at technical scaffolding but cannot replace artistic
direction or critical thinking. 

 SOL DUSTS OFF THE ARCHIVES IN SUNNY REBRAND (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sol has launched a refreshed identity aimed at young adults, blending
its Mexican heritage with a modern, energetic aesthetic. Created by
LOVE with illustrator Tobias Hall, the rebrand introduces a
revitalised wordmark, custom typography, updated historical elements,
and a brighter palette featuring elevated reds, golds, and new teal
accents. Together with an uplifted sun icon and more confident
attitude, the redesign delivers a “newstalgic” brand experience
that feels both authentic and contemporary. 

 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A UX RESEARCHER STARTS USING AI? (8 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 AI has become a practical companion rather than a replacement,
helping structure plans, speed up analysis, automate workflows, and
present findings more engagingly. It streamlines tasks, generates
guided insights, and boosts company-wide engagement while still
grounding everything in real user data. The result is faster research
cycles that free up time for the human essentials of the
job—judgment, creativity, and empathy.
