DISAPPEAR INTO THE BACKGROUND' (7 MINUTE READ) [7]

 HOW TRAUMA-INFORMED DESIGN CAN IMPROVE USER EXPERIENCES FOR ALL
AUDIENCES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trauma-informed design prioritizes safety, empathy, and empowerment,
enhancing user experiences by creating secure, inclusive environments.
Implementing this approach in research and design supports
participants with clear communication, sensitivity, and safeguarding
practices. This method benefits all users, promoting thoughtful,
accessible, compassionate digital interactions that build trust and
reduce stress. 

 BALANCING TEXT IN CSS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CSS text-wrapping features include `text-wrap: balance`, which
distributes space evenly across lines, and `text-wrap: pretty`, which
balances text only for orphan words. While `text-wrap: balance` has
been supported in all major browsers since May 2024, `text-wrap:
pretty` is limited to Chromium, with balancing effective for up to six
lines due to performance constraints. These features are ideal for
headlines, card content, and other text-heavy designs, with
alternatives like `br` elements and max-width adjustments offering
additional flexibility.
