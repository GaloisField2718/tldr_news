 APPLE‚ÄôS AI PROBLEM IS A UX PROBLEM, TOO (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is considering using Baidu's Ernie and other third-party AI
engines to enhance its capabilities. This could lead to challenges in
consistency and privacy concerns due to cloud reliance and Ernie's
alleged ties to the People's Liberation Army cyber warfare division.
It could also pose a significant hurdle in delivering a unique user
experience in the competitive AI market.

GENERATIVE AI APPLICATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

 SUPERCHARGE YOUR RESEARCH IMPACT: 10 SECRETS TO SUCCESS YOU WON‚ÄôT
LEARN IN SCHOOL (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Starting a career in user experience research poses challenges. This
article shares ten crucial steps to enhance research impact, from
using "risk" as a research guide to ensuring stakeholder alignment. 

 PROMPTS SHOULD BE DESIGNED ‚Äî NOT ENGINEERED (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI technology necessitates deliberate design rather than being
perceived as magical, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful
implementation. Prompt engineering involves programming a versatile
model for specific tasks, requiring comprehension of user requirements
and iterative refinement based on insights from both users and the
model. 

 EARN THE RIGHT TO ABSTRACT (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Like great artists, you must embrace the journey of abstraction and
systematically refine and distill an artifact down to its purest
essence. Move incrementally towards meaningful simplicity rather than
jumping straight to the end, as Picasso did. This iterative process
benefits you because you're gaining a deeper understanding of your
work and the audience. After all, it's not jarring at the end and
feels more natural.

 REINFORCING THE VALUE OF WEB DESIGNERS IN THE AGE OF AI (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 AI won‚Äôt replace designers. However, it may be time for designers
to reinforce the message of who they are and what they do. Unlike AI,
designers offer personal service and better communication and pay

 HOW WE REDESIGNED THE LINEAR UI (PART ‚Ö°) (12 MINUTE READ) [15]

 ENHANCING FIGMA TEXT STYLES WITH INTEGRATED COLOR VARIABLES: A CASE
STUDY (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Figma lets designers set text styles and color variables separately
without a direct link between them, which can be a problem. This
article proposes a seamless integration of color variables into text
styles, allowing designers to assign specific color variables to text
styles directly within Figma. Color variables in text styles improve
consistency and adherence to color guidelines, streamline design
tasks, and free up time for creativity.
