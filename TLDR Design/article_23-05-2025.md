NEWS & TRENDS

 JONY IVE'S AI GADGET RUMORED TO BE ‘SLIGHTLY LARGER' THAN HUMANE'S
AI PIN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Jony Ive and Sam Altman are reportedly developing a wearable AI
device slightly larger than Humane's AI Pin but designed to be as
compact and elegant as an iPod Shuffle. The device may lack a display
and rely on built-in cameras and microphones for environmental
awareness. It will potentially connect to smartphones and PCs for
processing and display. 

 APPLE WWDC 2025 PREPARES TO REDEFINE VISUAL DESIGN ACROSS IOS, MACOS,
AND BEYOND (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's WWDC 2025 will center on iOS 19 and unified design principles
expected to create visual consistency across iOS, macOS, iPadOS,
watchOS, and visionOS. Developer sessions will include over 100 video
presentations, labs, and direct access to Apple engineers. Focusing on
interface design and system integration, the conference will emphasize
software innovation rather than hardware announcements, positioning
design as central to Apple's platform evolution. 

 FIGMA SITES ACCESSIBILITY UPDATES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figma Sites introduced several accessibility improvements to help
users create more inclusive websites. The updates include semantic
HTML tags like 'button' and 'a' for interactive elements, enhanced
keyboard navigation, and automatic 'p' tags for text layers.
Background images no longer generate unnecessary announcements, and a
text rendering bug that separates final letters into separate spans
has been resolved.

 ANDREW “BOZ” BOSWORTH'S 10 RULES FOR NAVIGATING THE NEXT DESIGN
PARADIGM (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth shared 10 rules at Figma Config 2025
for navigating design's next shift. He urged starting with human
problems, questioning old constraints, and rethinking current
interaction models. Key points: know when to invent vs. optimize,
build many prototypes, and design complete systems, not parts. He
envisions disappearing interfaces and tools with a theory of mind and
uses iteration in products and personal growth. 

 DESIGN LEADERS MUST MANAGE THE INVISIBLE CLIENT – TIME (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Badberries' first year underscores the importance of managing the
“invisible client”—the internal demands of running a business
that compete with client-facing work for time and focus. Time should
be treated as a strategic investment, with intentional tracking,
thoughtful outsourcing, and focusing on projects that build long-term
value rather than immediate revenue. Sustaining business and creative
growth requires balancing daily execution and strategic planning. 

 WHY AI INTERVIEWS COULD BE BAD NEWS FOR HONEST DESIGNERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Though technically strong, a demo of an AI interview tool underscored
issues with design interview questions that assume ideal conditions
like full research support. Designers face tight budgets, limited
time, and little influence, making these questions unrealistic.
Interviews should reflect real-world constraints and value
adaptability, strategy, and quality work in imperfect systems.
