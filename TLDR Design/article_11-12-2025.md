NEWS & TRENDS

 GOOGLE PHOTOS LAUNCHES NEW VIDEO EDITING TOOLS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google Photos has introduced new video editing features, including
specialized templates with preset music and text overlays for quick
highlight reel creation on Android devices. The update features a
redesigned video editor with a universal timeline and an adaptive

templates, add their chosen photos and videos, and Google Photos
automatically generates a video synchronized to the music's beat. 

 INSTAGRAM'S DESIGN TWEAK OPENS A MASSIVE CAN OF WORMS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Instagram's first navigation update since 2022 has sparked strong
backlash, not because of the buttons themselves but because users feel
it reflects a deeper problem: the platform keeps drifting toward a
TikTok-style algorithm of viral videos instead of prioritizing posts
from accounts people actually follow. Many see the changes as part of
a broader trend of social platforms homogenizing around short-form
viral content, leaving users nostalgic for Instagram's earlier,
photo-focused, community-driven era.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW “SAVING TWO MINUTES” AS A DESIGNER CAN BE HUGE, DEPENDING ON
SCALE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Lead UX Designer streamlined a B2B workflow, saving employees 2
minutes per task, which translates to 500,000 hours saved monthly
across 10,000+ users completing the task 50 times daily. Designers
often miss how scale amplifies impact—a medium-priority issue
affecting one million users on a homepage typically warrants higher
priority than a critical issue affecting only 800 users in profile
settings. Mapping user workflows as funnels helps designers identify
where problems occur in the user journey and calculate which fixes
deliver maximum business value when resources are limited. 

 THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR ALL DESIGNERS (3 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Scott Berkun reflects on his books How Design Makes the World and Why
Design is Hard, sharing five core lessons that underpin both. These
lessons include: someone must pay for quality improvements, discussing
"quality" resonates better with leaders than "design", decision-makers
with power ultimately determine project outcomes, good design depends
entirely on context and constraints, and products are often designed
primarily for sale rather than use, creating a tension that explains
pervasive UX problems. 

 PANTONE'S NEW COLOUR OF THE YEAR IS GIVING ME EXISTENTIAL DREAD (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Pantone's 2026 Colour of the Year is “Cloud Dancer,” a soft white
meant to symbolize calm, reflection, and mental clarity. Many
designers are unimpressed, finding the choice bland, bleak, or even
recession-like. While Pantone frames it as a serene reset amid digital
chaos, online reactions mock its emptiness, arguing that instead of
inspiring optimism for the year ahead, the selection feels more like
an emblem of uncertainty and creative fatigue.

 IT'S TIME TO MOVE TO EXPERIENCE FIRST (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Organizations should adopt an "Experience-First" mindset that
integrates business strategy, technology, and design from the outset,
rather than treating them as sequential or siloed functions. Previous
approaches like Technology-First, Mobile-First, and Design-First each
offered valuable lessons, but ultimately remained limited by focusing
on individual aspects rather than the holistic customer journey. This
integrated approach requires structural alignment across people,
business models, processes, and technology, treating the complete
experience as the business strategy itself rather than an
afterthought. 

 GRILLI TYPE'S GT ERA BRINGS AN EARLY BAUHAUS CHIC BACK TO THE SANS
SERIF (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Grilli Type's new release, GT Era, is Thierry Blancpain's modern
reinterpretation of early, characterful pre-modernist grotesks like
Venus and Akzidenz Grotesk, designed to balance their warmth and
eccentricity with contemporary functionality. After extensive study
and refinement of historical curves and quirks, the typeface now works
across text and display sizes, with streamlined forms in smaller
weights and expressive details in heavier ones, launched alongside a
vibrant demo site that helped shape final adjustments, and ultimately
intended as a richer, more flavorful alternative to today's overly
uniform modernist sans-serif branding. 

 HOW TO SURVIVE INSTAGRAM'S ALGORITHM AS A CREATIVE (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Creator struggling with Instagram's collapsing reach aren't
alone—many artists say the algorithm now prioritizes engagement,
virality, and even selfies over actual work, leaving creators feeling
invisible despite loyal followings. Contributors stress that this drop
in visibility isn't personal: Instagram has shifted toward pay-to-play
dynamics and unpredictable recommendations, making it a poor source of
creative validation. Detach self-worth from metrics, treat Instagram
as a simple tool or portfolio, focus on real relationships with
clients and peers, and keep creating without letting fluctuating
numbers define your talent or future.
