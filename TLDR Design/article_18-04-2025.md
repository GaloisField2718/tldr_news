 NEW IPHONE 17 PRO RENDER SHOWS WHAT UNIBODY REAR DESIGN MIGHT LOOK
LIKE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A new render offers a closer look at the iPhone 17 Pro's unibody
rear, which showcases a sleek ‘camera bar' design with a uniform
color across the back. Unlike previous models, there's no two-tone
finish. The camera bump may include a larger Xenon flash, a
higher-resolution LiDAR scanner, or an additional sensor. This
redesign is part of Apple's iPhone 17 lineup, which is expected to
debut this fall. 

 CHATGPT INTRODUCES AN IMAGE LIBRARY TO STORE YOUR GENERATED PHOTOS (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has added an image library to ChatGPT that allows users to
easily access AI-generated images via a sidebar. Available on both web
and mobile platforms, it supports all users. Though simple, it could
signal OpenAI's push toward a social platform for image sharing,
boosting visibility, and gathering real-time user data for future
developments. 

 THE 2026 WINTER OLYMPIC TORCHES LET THE FLAME STEAL THE SHOW (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The 2026 Winter Olympic torches, called Essential, feature a
minimalist, open-top design that emphasizes the flame over the torch
itself. Designed by Studio Carlo Ratti Associati and made with
recycled materials and renewable fuel, the torches are lightweight,
reusable, and produce a warm, dynamic flame. The design reflects
Italy's modern design legacy and sets the tone for the Games' overall
aesthetic.

 OUR VISION FOR ACCELERATING CREATIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY WITH AGENTIC
AI (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe plans to integrate agentic AI across its tools to boost
creativity and productivity. These AI agents will assist with tasks,
offer suggestions, and streamline workflows, empowering users at all
skill levels. From Acrobat to Photoshop and Premiere Pro, Adobe
envisions agents that enhance human imagination, reduce tedious work,
and accelerate high-impact content creation. 

 CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS OFTEN A WAY TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF DESIGN (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Customer support is a key measure of design's impact, especially in
reducing complaints and improving user experience. UX designers can
better understand user pain points and improve designs by working with
support and content teams, which could lead to cost savings. This
collaboration helps create more intuitive experiences and lowers the
need for support. 

 FOSTERING AN ACCESSIBILITY CULTURE (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Facing job uncertainty, an accessibility team worked to embed
accessibility into their organizational culture by building lasting
habits and systems instead of chasing short-term compliance. They
focused on early integration, smart resource use, community building,
and leadership support to make accessibility a shared responsibility.
This approach promotes resilience and shows that small, consistent
efforts can drive meaningful, long-term change.
