 LOVABLE'S CEO TARGETS ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS AS THE ‘VIDE-CODING'
UNICORN DOUBLES ITS ANNUAL REVENUE TO $200 MILLION IN JUST FOUR MONTHS
(4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Swedish AI startup Lovable doubled its annual recurring revenue to
$200 million in just four months. The company's "vibe-coding" platform
allows users to describe desired apps in plain language, with AI
generating the actual code, targeting both non-technical users and
developers. Lovable is now focusing on enterprise customers while
expanding with senior hires from Notion, Dropbox, and Meta, having
raised over $225 million at a $1.8 billion valuation. 

 ALTMAN DESCRIBES OPENAI'S FORTHCOMING AI DEVICE AS MORE PEACEFUL AND
CALM THAN THE IPHONE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's forthcoming Jony Ive–designed device is a simple,
screenless, pocket-sized gadget meant to contrast sharply with today's
noisy, notification-heavy technology. Sam Altman says it will act as a
calm, context-aware assistant that filters information, knows when to
surface things, and becomes something users trust over long periods of
time. The goal is a product that feels as peaceful as “a cabin by a
lake,” despite being highly sophisticated under the hood. Ive has
confirmed it should arrive within two years. 

 AROUND 100 IPHONE FOLDS MADE AFTER ‘BREAKTHROUGH' IN ELIMINATING
THE CREASE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's long-rumored iPhone Fold has advanced to engineering
validation testing after a reported breakthrough that removes the
visible crease common in foldable displays. Although Samsung
manufactures the screen, Apple redesigned the panel structure,
materials, lamination process, and hinge system to achieve a
“crease-free” result. Foxconn has now set up a dedicated
production line as the device moves into pre-production. The foldable
iPhone—possibly called iPhone Ultra—is rumored to launch next year
at a very high price, potentially around $2,400.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 UX WON'T BE ABOUT HUMANS FOR LONG (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI agents will soon become the primary users of websites and apps,
requiring brands to redesign their user experience strategies
fundamentally. Unlike human browsers, agents arrive with specific
missions. They won't respond to traditional upselling tactics,
requiring changes such as enhanced SEO/GEO practices, enriched product
metadata, more precise navigation language, and behavioral data
analysis to distinguish between human and agentic visitors. While this
transformation won't happen overnight, brands should begin optimizing
their digital platforms now to prepare for an age of agency-first. 

 DEAR LLM, HERE'S HOW MY DESIGN SYSTEM WORKS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It's possible to achieve production-ready AI-generated code by
structuring Figma files with semantic naming, Auto Layout, design
tokens, and clear component architecture, then connecting them to
codebases via tools like Figma's Model Context Protocol and Code
Connect. Creating dedicated AI "cheat sheet" files can establish
coding standards, component usage rules, and specific Figma-to-code
workflows the AI must follow. This approach transforms design systems
into structured sources of truth that both humans and AI can interpret
consistently, reducing the trust gap developers have with AI-generated
code. 

 “THE EYE OF THE STORM” – AN AI EXPERT'S ADVICE FOR DESIGN
LEADERS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Generative AI is a transformation on the scale of the internet. Many
design agencies are underestimating how fundamentally it will reshape
their services, workflows, and business models. Leaders must move
beyond basic AI tricks, upskill their teams, organise their data, and
build structured AI programs to stay competitive. AI brings a new,
engaging form of craft. Studios that embrace it can unlock new value
and avoid falling behind.

 EVOLVE OR BECOME IRRELEVANT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 UX design has become the critical factor separating successful
digital products from failures, bridging complex technology with human
behavior through principles rooted in psychology and empathy. From
startups to enterprises across regions, organizations face mounting
pressure to prioritize UX-first approaches, as users now expect
enterprise tools to match the fluidity of consumer apps. As interfaces
evolve beyond screens into voice, wearables, and immersive
environments, companies must integrate cultural sensitivity and
behavioral understanding into their design. 

 THE FUTURE OF CREATIVITY (5 MINUTE READ) [14]

UK, showcasing over 300 films, immersive VR experiences, live music,

Summit, attracting 150 industry leaders from BBC, Film4, and major
production companies. Through its multidisciplinary programming and
partnerships with UNESCO Creative Cities and cultural institutions,
Aesthetica positions York as a creative hub driving national
conversations outside London. 

 ARCHITECTS AND DESIGNERS MOVING INTO UX, SAY RECRUITERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 More architects and industrial designers are shifting into UX/UI
design because it offers higher pay, better conditions, and more
opportunities. Their human-centred training makes the transition
fairly natural. However, despite strong long-term growth forecasts for
UX roles, the market is currently saturated, with far more designers
than available jobs—especially at junior levels—making entry into
the field increasingly competitive.
