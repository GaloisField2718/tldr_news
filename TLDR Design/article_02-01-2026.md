NEWS & TRENDS

 LEAKED PROTOTYPES REVEAL APPLE ONCE TESTED PINK AND YELLOW AIRPODS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Newly leaked photos from prototype collector Kosutami show that Apple
tested first-generation AirPods in bright pink and yellow, with
colored charging cases matching the iPhone 5c palette, while the
earbuds remained white. The prototypes indicate that Apple seriously
considered launching colorful options alongside the iPhone 7 before
ultimately choosing the iconic all-white design. While AirPods Max
later introduced color variants, standard AirPods and AirPods Pro have
maintained their white-only appearance across all generations,
prioritizing brand identity over personalization. 

 GOOGLE SANS FLEX IS NOW ON GOOGLE FONTS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Sans, Google's proprietary brand font, was developed over
years with advanced variable features like weight, grade, and optical
size. Until now, it hasn't been available outside the company. Google
has made it available to everyone through Google Fonts. 

 QWEN-IMAGE-EDIT-2511: IMPROVE CONSISTENCY (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 introduces several enhancements over its
predecessor, including improved character and multi-person
consistency, integrated LoRA capabilities, and stronger geometric
reasoning for design applications. The model can now perform
identity-preserving edits, merge multiple portraits into coherent
group photos, and generate industrial designs with realistic lighting
and material variations. Users can access the model through Qwen
Chat's Image Editing feature, though local deployment via ModelScope
is recommended for optimal performance.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO DESIGN TO ALERT USERS WITHOUT OVERWHELMING THEM (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Effective alert design requires managing user attention as a scarce
resource by distinguishing between alarms (which require immediate
action) and anomalies (which invite investigation). The Yerkes-Dodson
law demonstrates that both too little and too much stimulation harm
performance, making it critical to create clear visual hierarchies.
When everything appears equally urgent, users experience alarm fatigue
and miss critical information, so designers must prioritize creating
systems that instantly signal what demands action now versus what can
wait. 

 THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL REBRANDS AND LOGO REDESIGNS OF 2025 (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 2025 proved to be the most perilous year yet for rebrands, as social
media backlash turned even routine logo updates into controversies and
pushed some brands to reverse decisions, like Cracker Barrel and
McDonald's. High-profile redesigns from media networks, global
corporations, transport bodies, luxury carmakers, sports teams, and
cultural institutions showed that public reaction is now as
influential as design strategy itself. 

 DESIGN IS MORE THAN CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The debate around designing with code overlooks a deeper concern: as
tools and AI evolve, the risk is devaluing designers' core
contribution of defining problems, intent, and vision. Design is
presented as a non-linear practice where conceptual thinking must come
before execution, regardless of medium, or else products risk becoming
efficient to build but poorly considered.

 TOP 10 DESIGN OBJECTS AND MATERIALS OF 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This roundup highlights ten design projects from 2025 that
prioritized sustainability, sensory interaction, and material
innovation through biology and technology. Featured works include a
biodegradable gaming controller, a fungi-based prosthetic organ that
digests microplastics in the body, and Yamaha's digital piano made

microalgae pigments for sustainable color, touch-responsive sonic
furniture, tableware designed to enhance taste perception through
gastrophysics research, and a modular pen with textured grips to
stimulate creative thinking. 

 INCREASE YOUR VALUE WITH SYSTEMS THINKING (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Systems thinking in design means looking beyond isolated tasks to
understand products as interconnected ecosystems, ensuring you
identify the real problem before designing solutions that balance user
needs, business goals, and technical constraints. By considering
dependencies, consequences, feedback loops, and multiple perspectives
early, designers produce higher-quality, more resilient solutions and
increase their overall value.
