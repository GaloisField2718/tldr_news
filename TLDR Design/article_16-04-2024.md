NEWS & TRENDS

 OREO RECKONS IT INSPIRED THE DESIGN OF AN UBIQUITOUS UI ICON (1
MINUTE READ) [3] 

 McDonald's claims in a mockumentary that the Big Mac inspired the
hamburger menu icon in UI, but Oreo challenges this by humorously
suggesting the icon is actually two stacked Oreo cookies, even
offering a discount on biscuits for adopting this theory.

 CODEGEN PLUGINS (AND OTHER TIPS) FOR AUTOMATING DESIGN TO CODE (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Codegen automatically generates code based on a defined set of rules
or specifications. Although Figma's Developer Mode streamlines a
considerable portion of design implementation, an entire plugin
ecosystem can further speed up your design-to-development workflow.
Figma's team recommendations include Anima, Builder, Figma to Code,
Locofy.AI, and Replit. 

 AI UX-DESIGN TOOLS ARE NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME: STATUS UPDATE (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI tools won't replace UX designers soon as the currently available
LLM-based tools are not shortcutting steps in the design process yet.
Designers should avoid using AI to generate user data or research
findings due to ethical concerns and shouldn't expect significant
value from AI tools. 

 BE ANTI-ABLEIST (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Accessibility doesn't just happen in an ableist world. The mechanisms
and automatisms are not tuned to produce accessible content, code, or
designs. As a designer, developer, project manager, or in any role,
you must focus on accessibility and do it intentionally. It will not
happen automatically every day of the week.

creativity, and effective time management. It often requires working

 WHY ARE UX PROFESSIONALS ON SOCIAL MEDIA THIEVES OF JOY? (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 UX professionals often feel the need to jump on their accessible
white horse and yell at the world about their high moral standards for
what good UX is supposed to be, how a company should invest its
resources, what a product's roadmap should be, and how we should all
look at them as the last standing heroes that separate us from a world
of unusable products.
