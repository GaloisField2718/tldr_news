 MICROSOFT TEASES THE FUTURE OF WINDOWS: 'THE COMPUTER WILL BE ABLE TO
SEE WHAT WE SEE, HEAR WHAT WE HEAR, AND WE CAN TALK TO IT' (5 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Microsoft's VP for OS Security, David Weston, envisions Windows 2030
featuring multimodal AI interactions with voice commands. Computers
will see what users see and hear what they hear, enabling
sophisticated natural communication beyond traditional
mouse-and-keyboard interfaces. The author questions whether such
dramatic changes will realistically occur by 2030, suggesting the
timeline may be overly ambitious. 

 PIXEL BUDS 2A LEAK REVEALS REFRESHED DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Leaked renders reveal Google's redesigned Pixel Buds 2a with a
refreshed case featuring unified colors matching the earbuds. The
budget-friendly A-series model comes in Iris purple and other colors,
including black, Hazel, and Fog Light. Leaked specifications show
Active Noise Cancellation, Spatial Audio, and a seven-hour battery
life ahead of the Made by Google event.

UI elements like toggles and tab bars. While no major design reversals
are expected before launch, these tweaks make the new look feel more
polished.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 OUTCOMES OVER OUTPUT: DESIGN SYSTEMS AND AI (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design system practitioners surveyed show cautious optimism about
AI's impact, rating their future confidence 3.3 out of 5. Leadership
seeks quick AI integration to avoid falling behind, but practitioners
emphasize gaps between AI hype and practical workflow improvements.
Design systems should serve as AI training infrastructure rather than
focusing on output, requiring evolution toward strategic roles. 

 IT'S 2025. WHY DOES UX STILL SUCK? (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Digital user experiences remain fundamentally flawed despite decades
of research and established best practices. Three potential causes
include underinvestment in UX, inexperienced practitioners, and talent
being excluded from critical technical decisions. A trillion-dollar
opportunity awaits companies willing to differentiate through
genuinely delightful user experiences. 

 CONFESSIONS FROM A SELL OUT DESIGNER (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A designer's perspective shifted from pure user advocacy to embracing
business priorities such as ROI, strategic focus, scope control,
technical feasibility, and balancing speed with quality. The evolution
reframed “selling out” as learning the business's language. It
enabled the designer to gain influence, secure resources, and deliver
greater impact for both users and the organization.

 IN USER RESEARCH, DON'T STOP AT “YES” OR “NO” (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Product stakeholders frequently seek binary validation from user
research rather than using it for discovery and insight generation.
Simple yes/no responses prove unreliable and misleading, as
participants often provide socially desirable answers without genuine
feedback. Research delivers greater value when capturing nuanced
insights about solution strengths and weaknesses rather than just flat
validation. 

 AI WON'T KILL UX, OUR HABITS WILL: WHY DESIGNERS MUST STAY
INTENTIONAL (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI tools aren't destroying UX design—designers' unintentional
habits of prioritizing speed over thoughtful, human-centered processes
are the real threat. Machine learning replicates existing patterns
rather than innovating, creating efficient but soulless experiences
when designers rely on automation without reflection. Maintaining
curiosity, intentional research practices, and human empathy remains
crucial as teams must use AI to support rather than replace critical
thinking. 

 STUDIO KILN REFRESHES VINTED'S BRAND WITH A CONFIDENT, FLEXIBLE
IDENTITY ROOTED IN ITS COMMUNITY SPIRIT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Vinted's refreshed identity, developed with Studio Kiln, modernises
and unifies the brand while preserving its recognisable handwritten
logo and signature Calypso green. The update introduces a flowing line
graphic, refined colour palette with added Mint accents, custom VC
Honey typography, tactile imagery, and motion design, creating a
flexible, globally adaptable toolkit that strengthens brand
recognition, celebrates its circular economy mission, and stands out
in a competitive resale market.
