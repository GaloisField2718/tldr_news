 SPOTIFY'S LATEST UI DESIGN CHANGE IS DRIVING PEOPLE CRAZY (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Spotify recently introduced a ‘Create' button to facilitate
playlist creation. The button replaced the traditional ‘Library'
button, leading to user frustration. The change appears to be an
attempt to promote Spotify's AI playlist feature, but many users find
it disruptive to their navigation habits. The backlash highlights the
importance of user-centered design and the risks of implementing
features without considering user preferences.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE MAKING OF THE FIGMA PATTERN LIBRARY (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Figma Pattern Library (FPL) was rebuilt from the ground up to
unify a fragmented design system. Using a collaborative
design-engineering approach to bridge design intent and technical
implementation, the Figma team leveraged automation and Figma's REST
API for syncing design tokens and variables, achieving improved
consistency, accessibility, and adoption across the system. 

 THE 5 MOST DANGEROUS (AND EXCITING) IDEAS FOR DESIGNERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Embrace creativity, take risks, and recognize that good ideas can
come from anyone, regardless of training or experience. Success in
design involves persuasion, influence, and the courage to champion
ideas while fostering collaboration across diverse perspectives. 

 COGNITIVE BIASES IN UX DESIGN (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts we use to simplify
decision-making. Using these shortcuts can lead to errors.
Understanding bias helps UX designers predict behaviors and improve
user experiences. Examples of biases include negativity bias, peak-end
rule, and anchoring bias. Biases influence memory, perceptions, and
decisions. By recognizing these patterns, designers can create more
intuitive, engaging, and effective interfaces.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OVERFLOW CLIP (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The overflow: clip property offers a precise way to hide the
limitations of overflow by restricting clipping to a single axis
without creating scrollable containers. This method is useful for
layouts that require single-direction clipping, scroll-driven
animations, or decorative effects. It is supported by major browsers,
with some variations in handling overflow-clip margin. 

 DESIGN SYSTEM: FROM SCRATCH OR FROM THE SHELF? (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Whether you choose between custom-built or off-the-shelf UI component
libraries for design systems should depend on project needs,
frameworks, and resources. Off-the-shelf options save time and
resources but may lack flexibility. Styled components enable quick
prototyping, while unstyled components offer customization. A blend of
libraries or custom solutions is often used to balance efficiency and
design flexibility.
