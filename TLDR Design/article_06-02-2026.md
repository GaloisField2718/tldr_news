 AN ARTIST BACKLASH JUST SAVED ADOBE ANIMATE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe sparked backlash by announcing—with just a month's
notice—that it would discontinue the 30-year-old Adobe Animate
(formerly Flash), cutting off future downloads and access to users'
work, despite the software's ongoing popularity and historic
importance. After intense outcry from artists who warned of job losses
and cultural damage, Adobe reversed the decision within 24 hours. 

 TIM COOK REVEALED STANDOUT AI FEATURE FOR USERS, AND IT'S RUMORED TO
GET EVEN BETTER (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tim Cook says visual intelligence is one of the most popular Apple
Intelligence features, evolving in iOS 26 from a camera-only tool into
a system-wide AI that works on screenshots to translate text, create
links, and take actions across apps. He likely highlighted it because
Apple plans to expand visual intelligence beyond the iPhone into
future wearables like camera-equipped AirPods Pro and Apple Glasses,
making it a core AI feature across devices.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DOES EVERY DESIGNER ULTIMATELY HAVE TO MANAGE PEOPLE? THE IC PATH (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The IC (Individual Contributor) path allows designers to advance
their careers and increase their organizational impact without moving
into people-management roles. Career progression typically follows
Junior → Mid-level → Senior → Staff → Principal →
Distinguished, with the path focusing primarily on craft and design
problem-solving skills. As designers advance along the IC path, they
tackle increasingly complex problems and gain greater independence. 

 HOW TO USE CLAUDE CODE FOR UX WRITING (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Claude Code is an AI tool that runs on your computer and can directly
access and edit your files, unlike the web version, which only works
with copy-pasted content. UX writers can use it to audit content,
check consistency, and make text changes across multiple files using
plain English commands without needing coding skills. The tool reduces
dependence on developers for routine content updates and offers safety
features, such as "Plan Mode," which prompts for permission before
making changes. 

 THE AI DELEGATION MATRIX: WHAT PARTS OF YOUR UI SHOULDN'T EXIST? (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI product design needs a clear, systematic way to decide when humans
should lead, when AI should assist, and when tasks should be fully
delegated, instead of vaguely adding AI everywhere. Using simple
scores for risk and payoff, teams can map workflows to the right
control mode to balance speed, safety, accountability, and real user
value.

 LOST FOR WORDS: WHY TEXT IN AI IMAGES STILL GOES WRONG (9 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AI image generators struggle with text because they pattern-match
visual shapes rather than understanding language, treating letters as
pixels. While text generation accuracy has improved significantly in
newer models like Ideogram and Recraft V3, editing existing text
remains challenging because models must preserve surrounding context
while modifying specific regions. Designers currently work around
these limitations by using text-focused generators, adding typography
in traditional design tools after image creation, or employing hybrid
workflows across multiple platforms. 

 HERE'S HOW APPLE MAY PROTECT THE DISPLAY OF THE IPHONE FOLD (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Apple is reportedly taking extra steps to avoid past foldable-phone
failures by exploring a tougher built-in screen protector for the
upcoming iPhone Fold, alongside design changes to reduce internal
cable damage. Unlike Samsung's PET film, Apple may use a more
scratch-resistant (but pricier) transparent polyimide layer to better
protect the ultra-thin folding glass.
