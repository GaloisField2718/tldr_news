 MICROSOFT IS TESTING A "LIVE" INTERFACE FOR COPILOT (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Microsoft is testing a new visual interface for Copilot featuring an
animated droplet character that responds with real-time expressions.
The experimental feature is available to limited Windows 11 testers
who have enabled voice interaction settings. Microsoft aims to make
digital assistants more expressive and human-like through nonverbal
communication enhancements. 

 ANNOUNCING WEBFLOW'S AEO MATURITY MODEL (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI engines are increasingly rewriting brand narratives for potential
customers, often incorrectly describing companies and omitting key
differentiators. Webflow's Answer Engine Optimization Maturity Model
provides a four-category framework helping marketers regain control
over their brand stories. Brands must act quickly to shape how AI
discovers and presents them before competitors gain an advantage in
this emerging landscape. 

 WHY IS EVERYONE SO ANGRY ABOUT INSTAGRAM'S NEW FONT? (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Instagram's new font, Rosalía—named after the Spanish pop star and
based on her handwriting—was introduced to inspire creativity, but
has sparked a strong backlash from users who find it messy, hard to
read, and aesthetically irritating. While Meta promotes it as a fun,
expressive option for Stories and Reels, many users have compared it
to a design disaster, proving once again that fonts can provoke
surprisingly emotional reactions.

 A QUICK PRODUCT SIMPLICITY TEST: REMOVE ALL THE EXPLAINERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A product simplicity test involves removing all explainers and seeing
if users can still navigate intuitively. The New User Experience (NUX)
often serves as a crutch rather than addressing underlying design
clarity issues. This mental exercise of eliminating explanatory
content makes products more usable even when users skip through
tutorials. 

 INTERFACES THAT AUGMENT OR REPLACE? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Complementary interfaces strengthen cognitive abilities. Competitive
interfaces replace functions without revealing their logic. Recent MIT
research suggests frequent ChatGPT use can impair memory, original
thinking, and idea generation over time. Interface designers should
create tools that help users grow rather than just complete tasks
efficiently. 

 WHAT ON HOLY TERRA HAPPENED TO THE GAMES WORKSHOP LOGO? (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Games Workshop has quietly adopted a new, clean sans-serif logo on
its corporate materials, separating its identity further from its
consumer-facing Warhammer brand, which still uses the iconic hammer
symbol. While longtime fans may lament the loss of the old
fantasy-inspired wordmark, the rebrand reflects the company's
evolution into a modern, highly profitable business — one that now
prioritizes versatility and corporate presentation over nostalgia.

 HOW FORMATTING TEXT IN WEB DESIGN INCREASES CONVERSIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Strategic text formatting techniques like bold emphasis and short
sentences can significantly boost website conversion rates. Making
content scannable through subheadings, bullet points, and proper
whitespace helps users quickly find key information. Adding
high-quality images, videos, and interactive elements further enhances
user engagement and drives conversions. 

 IMPLEMENTING ACCESSIBLE SVG ELEMENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SVGs offer superior accessibility compared to bitmap images through

proper accessible markup. Best practices include ensuring sufficient
contrast, keyboard accessibility for interactive elements, and
thorough testing with real assistive technologies.
