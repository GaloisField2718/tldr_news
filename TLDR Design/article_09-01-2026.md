 UPDATED LEFT NAVIGATION BAR IN FIGMA DESIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The new left navigation bar in Figma Design, Draw, and Dev Mode
improves navigation between library assets, variables, and search with
toggleable labels available in the View menu. A redesigned variable
authoring experience now offers an edge-to-edge full-screen view that

 GMAIL DEBUTS A PERSONALIZED AI INBOX, AI OVERVIEWS IN SEARCH, AND
MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is rolling out a new AI Inbox for Gmail that surfaces
suggested to-dos and grouped updates, adds natural-language AI
Overviews to inbox search, and introduces a Grammarly-like Proofread
tool, while keeping the traditional inbox optional. Many AI features
previously limited to paid tiers are expanding to all users, with
advanced tools like AI search overviews and Proofread initially
available to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. 

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY TESTING CHATGPT ADS SOON (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is reportedly testing advertisements within ChatGPT using
internal employee-only chat models. The company has been exploring ad
layouts and sponsored response disclosures despite CEO Sam Altman
telling employees in December that public-facing app advertising plans
were on hold. OpenAI aims to create a new type of digital advertising
that maintains user trust while providing stable funding for the
company.

 THE 90% PROBLEM: WHY OTHERS' AIS' DESIGNS MAY BECOME YOUR PROBLEM (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI tools now enable non-designers to create visual designs that
appear 90% complete, commoditizing what was once a designer's
exclusive superpower: visualization. However, these AI-generated
designs still require the critical 10% of iterative refinement that
only trained designers can provide by understanding and articulating
the "why" behind design decisions. Designers' evolving role centers on
bridging user needs, business goals, and technical constraints while
justifying design choices that AI cannot yet evaluate or explain. 

 FROM 0 TO MINIMUM LOVABLE PRODUCT (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MTCHMKR is a consumer SaaS platform that connects brands for creative
partnerships that addresses the disjointed process across Slack
communities. It is a polished product with subscription management,
AI-assisted matchmaking, and mobile functionality. The team launched a
beta at $1/month to overcome the cold-start problem, gathering
waitlist users through social media. It has planned future AI agents
for deeper brand research and partnership strategy. 

 SAME, BUT NEW: UX RESEARCH IN THE AGE OF LLMS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX research isn't becoming obsolete in the age of AI - it's shifting
upstream to define what meaningful, high-quality AI outputs look like
by grounding prompts, formats, and evaluation criteria in real user
needs and context. Researchers play a strategic role in shaping,
guiding, and holding LLM-based systems accountable for delivering
genuine value by translating human expectations into clear quality
signals and rubrics.

 DON'T SHIP ANOTHER CHAT UI. BUILD REAL AI WITH AG-UI (14 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 AG-UI (Agent User Interaction Protocol) provides an event-driven
framework for building AI applications beyond basic chat interfaces,
standardizing communication between agents, tools, and UIs through
structured events. The protocol enables developers to create reusable
agent logic that streams responses, handles tool calls, and manages
state across multiple client types (web, CLI, and mobile). 

 YOUR LOGO WORKS HARD. HOW ABOUT YOUR MOTION? (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A study of 1,300+ brand professionals found that while 81% recognized
Disney's motion design, only 14% identified Uber's, indicating that
brands invest in motion without making it strategically distinctive.
Effective motion identity requires connecting movement to core brand
strategy through systematic principles that scale across touchpoints.
Consistency and time build recognizable motion signatures. Clear rules
enable creative flexibility while maintaining brand authenticity
across all contexts and teams.

READ) [14]

by food editorial and cookbooks, shifting away from convenience-led
meal-kit tropes toward quality, provenance, and the joy of cooking.
Spanning typography, photography, motion, layout, and tone of voice,
the update positions healthy eating as an everyday luxury that feels
warm, chef-led, and genuinely desirable across all touchpoints.
