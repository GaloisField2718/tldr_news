 JONY IVE'S LOVEFROM HELPED DESIGN RIVIAN'S FIRST ELECTRIC BIKE (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 LoveFrom, a creative firm led by former Apple designer Jony Ive,
collaborated closely with Rivian's skunkworks team for about 18 months
to help develop its first electric bike. The firm contributed to
design, UI/UX, and packaging before concluding its role in late 2024.
This secretive micromobility project later spun out into a startup
called Also, which has received $105 million in funding and plans to
unveil its first “bike-like” product later this year. 

 IOS 26 REVAMP DETAILED IN NEW REPORT: ‘DIGITAL GLASS' DESIGN WITH
BIG CHANGES FOR SAFARI AND MORE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iOS 26 will feature the most significant redesign since iOS 7.
Heavily inspired by visionOS, with a focus on glass-like elements,
transparency, and redesigned icons, widgets, and interface components,
such as Safari and the Phone app, the update will also introduce the
macOS Preview app to iPhone and iPad, alongside other enhancements,
including a revamped CarPlay, new Messages features, and a dedicated
Apple Games app. 

 GOOGLE INTRODUCES SMALL WATERMARK TO VEO 3 VIDEOS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Google has quietly added a small, visible watermark to videos created
with its new Veo 3 AI model. The pale white "Veo" watermark appears in
the bottom right corner but is barely noticeable to casual viewers
scrolling through social media. This visible watermark supplements the
invisible SynthID watermark already embedded in all Google
AI-generated content. Experts warn the tiny watermark can be easily
cropped out and may not effectively prevent AI-generated
misinformation from spreading.

 I TRIED THREE WAYS TO SHIP A DESIGN SYSTEM. HERE'S WHAT ACTUALLY
WORKED (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Rolling out a new design system is typically an 18-month effort.
Success hinges more on strategic implementation than visual design.
Projects that focus on iterative rollouts, anchored in real feature
development, tend to outperform both complete redesigns and gradual
component swaps. The most effective systems are designed in context,
built to scale, and judged by adoption rather than aesthetic
perfection. 

 HOW TO MULTIPLY YOUR VALUE AS A DESIGNER IN THE AGE OF AI (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Growth Product Designers combine design skills with data analysis,
user research, and prioritization of business impact. Principles for
multiplying designer value include starting with data-driven
hypotheses, iterating quickly through experiments, applying cognitive
psychology principles, optimizing for learning speed over polish, and
demonstrating measurable business impact. This approach transforms
designers from product creators into essential business partners who
can deliver ROI in an AI-driven economy. The shift requires designers
to connect user needs with business goals while maintaining speed and
accountability.
