MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Discord just refreshed its desktop app, bringing it more in line with

full dark mode called Onyx. There are now four theme options: better
spacing, a resizable channel list, and a clearer call bar to see if
your mic or camera is on quickly. The game overlay is faster,
customizable with widgets, and won't mess with your frame rate or get
flagged by anti-cheat systems.

leader in personalized digital discovery.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 "Beigeification" in design refers to the growing homogenization of
brands and products driven by a fear of appearing tacky or unpolished.

highlighting the need for more originality and innovation. 

 NAMING THINGS IN DESIGN SYSTEMS–AND WHY IT'S THE WORST (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 In design systems, naming can be either essential or frustratingly
convoluted. Clear, concise names improve communication, while overly
creative or abstract names create confusion. Balancing clarity and
flexibility is difficult, especially for design tokens. Consistency,
simplicity, and avoiding acronyms help maintain usability. 

 DECLINING ROI FROM UX DESIGN WORK (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX design has steadily improved, making major usability gains less
frequent and reducing its return on investment. Early UX efforts fixed
glaring usability issues, delivering high returns. By 2020, most
designs followed established best practices, requiring costly
refinements for marginal benefits.
