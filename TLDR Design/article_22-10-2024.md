 WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BE TOO EAGER TO SHARE YOUR WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Restraint is key in design, especially at senior levels.
Overproducing too quickly can harm outcomes. Designers must manage
visuals strategically, resisting demands for instant results.
Communicating processes, chunking tasks, and using visuals wisely help
balance quality and speed. This approach empowers designers to
understand problems and create effective solutions. 

 YES, DESIGN CAN SAVE YOU MILLIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Poor design in critical systems can cause costly errors and is often
undervalued in complex systems like FinTech. The "canvas-based node
system" offers a more interactive approach to payment routing,
simplifying decision-making and reducing errors compared to
traditional static methods. 

 TIME FOR A MORE PROGRESSIVE DESIGN MODEL (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Agile methodology, which emphasizes outcomes and rapid
innovation, has replaced the Waterfall model. Designer-developer
handoffs need to be more efficient. The Progressive Design Model (PDM)
streamlines the design process by integrating code-based deliverables
and aligning with Agile principles, emphasizing iteration, precise
planning, and AI tools.
