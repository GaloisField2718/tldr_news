 FIGMA‚ÄôS ONLY INTEREST IS REVENUE, AND IT‚ÄôS GOING TO ERODE THE
DESIGN CULTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma never cared about the design community. By ignoring its own UX
problems for years, it normalized ignorance towards customers‚Äô needs
and bad design patterns, spreading its bad influence on a whole
generation of designers. 

 IN PRAISE OF BUTTONS ‚Äì PART TWO (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple started the ‚Äútouch = good‚Äù trend with the iPhone in 2007.
Makers of all sorts of devices started replacing physical buttons with
touchscreens or touch-sensitive elements. This trend led to thousands
of products being made, including some that were simply unpleasant or
outright infuriating to use. 

 CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE 3.0 IS HERE (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GenAI can build a synthetic partnership layer into every
product/service by mimicking the human support layer that the digital
transformation removed. Rather than being alone on their journey,
customers will be continuously assisted by an AI partner. A company
seeking differentiated value for customers will have to increase the
capabilities of its AI agents to solve more customer problems.

 INTERVIEW WITH ARIEL SALMINEN, NORD'S DESIGN SYSTEMS ARCHITECT (10
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nordic's Design Systems Architect Ariel Salminen discusses the
challenges of building a design system, the importance of
collaboration, and how design systems affect the organization and its
people. According to Salminen, we should focus less on tools and
processes and more on the people involved and how our design system
affects them. 

 WHICH IS BETTER; ZOOM, TEAMS, OR MEET? (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 When it comes to Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, the person
who creates the meeting decides which tool to use, subjecting every
person they meet to a ‚Äúguest experience‚Äù that is often dire.
Random updates, installations, errors, account creation, and gear
setup are just a few things that users have to go through. 

 THE THREE SECRETS TO FONT PAIRING (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Good graphic design is mainly about a solid typography foundation,
which is incredibly challenging with font pairings. This 3-step
framework makes pairing a breeze. Start by finding the best anchor
font you can find. Next, find a typeface in the sweet spot of
similarity and contrast it with your anchor font. Lastly, aim for the
right amount of personality without compromising functionality.

 WHY HAND-DRAWN DESIGNS ARE RISING IN THE DIGITAL AGE (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Hand-drawn work's rough charm and human touch are increasingly
attracting audiences because of its high level of personality in a
world of sleek sterile pixels. In contrast to algorithmic-driven
design trends, hand-drawn designs evoke warmth and authenticity, add a
human touch, and convey care, thoughtfulness, and uniqueness. 

 EMBRACING ‚ÄúGOOD ENOUGH‚Äù IN DESIGN: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The temptation to polish everything to perfection is natural - and a
mistake. "Good enough" does not mean mediocre - it means meeting the
user's needs and attaining the business objectives with efficient and
practical work. 

 ACCLAIMED ARTIST SACHA JAFRI BELIEVES AI ART "IS VERY DANGEROUS" TO
HUMANITY (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Sacha Jafri sold his painting 'Journey of Humanity' in 2021 for $62
million, the third-highest sum ever for a living artist. The
Dubai-based painter uses art to connect with and understand the world
