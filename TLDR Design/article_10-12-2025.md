NEWS & TRENDS

 FACEBOOK'S REDESIGN IS MAKING IT MORE LIKE INSTAGRAM (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Meta is redesigning Facebook to feel more like Instagram, introducing
grid layouts for multi-photo posts and double-tap likes to create a
simpler, more immersive feed. The update also streamlines tools for
Stories and posts, enhances search with an immersive grid, and lets
users give clearer feedback to shape their algorithmic feed.
Additional tweaks to menus and comments signal a broader push to make
Facebook cleaner and easier to use heading into next year. 

 DESIGN CHIEF GERRY MCGOVERN DEPARTS JAGUAR (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gerry McGovern, Jaguar Land Rover's chief creative officer for 21
years, has reportedly left the company following his controversial
rebranding of Jaguar and the unveiling of the radical Type 00 concept
car. His departure comes months after the appointment of a new chief
executive, PB Balaji, though specific details remain undisclosed and
the company declined to comment. McGovern, an OBE recipient recognized
for transforming brands like Defender and Range Rover, described the
Type 00 as a foundation for reimagining Jaguar's identity. 

 IPHONE 18 LEAK SAYS FACE ID MOVING UNDER-DISPLAY NEXT YEAR (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly planning to introduce under-display Face ID in
the iPhone 18 lineup using new “micro-transparent glass panels,”
which would allow the Dynamic Island to shrink noticeably. Early
models next year—the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max, and the foldable—are
expected to get this first, while the base iPhone 18 and iPhone Air 2
will arrive months later, giving Apple time to decide whether the
technology can expand to the full lineup.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 SILICON CLAY: HOW AI IS RESHAPING UX DESIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Academic research from the past five years reveals AI's most
significant impact on UX design occurs during testing and discovery
phases, with 58% of studied usage concentrated there, though
practitioners actively employ AI tools like ChatGPT across all design
stages. The technology delivers clear efficiency gains and cost
reductions while lowering skill barriers, but researchers warn against
over-reliance that can produce generic designs, stifle innovation, and
impede junior designers' skill development. Studies emphasize that
successful AI integration requires human-in-the-loop validation,
organizational policies for ethical use, and specific training in
prompt engineering. 

 CRITIQUE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design critiques are structured sessions where designers
pressure-test assumptions through constructive friction, not to seek
approval but to identify flaws before they become costly. Unlike
reviews or brainstorming, critiques help designers decouple their
self-worth from their work while building communication skills and
executive presence through controlled vulnerability. Effective
critiques require skilled facilitation, balance highlighting successes
with addressing weaknesses, and embracing discomfort as evidence of
appropriate risk-taking rather than playing it safe. 

 VIBE CODING IN STYLE.MD (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Evil Martians developed a style guide that encodes engineering best
practices into a reusable file for AI code generation tools. The guide
emerged from comparing a hastily AI-generated Rails app with its
expert-refactored version, capturing patterns such as domain-specific
naming, enum usage, and the extraction of logic into namespaced
classes. This approach transforms expensive code cleanup into a
scalable asset that helps non-engineers produce more maintainable
AI-generated code.

 ROYAL ALBERT HALL GETS A BOLD VISUAL OVERHAUL THAT UNITES ITS
ARCHITECTURE AND REPUTATION (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Royal Albert Hall has unveiled a confident new identity by Brandpie
designed to shift recognition back to the venue itself and reflect the
unique, iconic experience it offers. Centered on a domed wordmark
inspired by the building's architecture, a unified type system, and a
bold signature red, the rebrand modernizes the Hall while amplifying
its historic character and giving its internal team a clearer, more
flexible system to use across all touchpoints. 

 SAY HELLO TO AGUZZO, DISPLAAY'S CARVED SERIF INSPIRED BY ITALIAN TYPE
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Aguzzo is a new typeface that builds on a few eccentric cues from the
Italian engraver's classic Augustea but ultimately becomes something
far more original, blending sharply carved geometric forms with
unexpectedly calligraphic, steep italics for a flexible, hybrid voice.
Developed through a Danish–Czech collaboration between Kasper
Rasmussen and Displaay, the project refines quirky letterforms,
embraces European typographic heritage, and expands into a robust
family of seven weights and 14 styles, resulting in a distinctive yet
highly usable type system defined by sharpness, craftsmanship, and
character. 

 GREAT BRITISH RAILWAYS GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE WITH NEW BRANDING (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The UK has revealed the first branding and livery for Great British
Railways, a new national rail body meant to unify the fragmented
system under one public-facing organisation. Designed in-house, the
identity combines the classic 1965 double-arrow symbol and Rail
Alphabet 2 with a sharpened red-white-blue palette and angular,
Union-Flag-inspired graphics. Early reactions range from cautious
praise to criticism of the designs as fussy or retro-modern. The true
test will come when the branding rolls out across trains, stations,
and digital platforms ahead of GBR's full launch in 2027.
