 TOP 10 MISTAKES WHEN CREATING USER JOURNEY MAPS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A user journey should have clear objectives, rely on user research to
avoid making false assumptions, and understand how emotions affect
users' decisions. A compelling user journey considers the context

journey maps require a balance between simplicity and complexity and
their design needs to be revisited periodically.
