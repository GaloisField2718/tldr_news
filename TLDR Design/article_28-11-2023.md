 Power distance (PD) is the extent to which the less powerful members
of institutions and organizations within a country expect and accept
that power is distributed unequally. High PD cultures prefer
established brands, rely more on structure, and are slower to adopt
new technology ‚Äî all this needs to be taken into account when
choosing the correct tone of voice in UX writing or using photography
or correct translations in UI. 

 ARE DESIGN ETHICS USELESS? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 With so many companies disrespecting the needs and rights of users, a
lot of it has become a sort of standard practice. There are three key
reasons for that: Designers are not really in control, everyone has an
ethic (even criminals) so it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good because of
them, and good design requires design organizations so individual
designers can‚Äôt be blamed for an organization‚Äôs poor choices.

its strategic approach.
