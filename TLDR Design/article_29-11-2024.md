 ARTISTS SAY THEY LEAKED OPENAI'S SORA VIDEO MODEL IN PROTEST (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's unreleased text-to-video model, Sora, faced controversy
after beta testers leaked early access. They criticized the company
for exploiting artists as unpaid testers and accused OpenAI of
prioritizing “art washing” over meaningful artist support. OpenAI
defended the voluntary program, saying it was working to balance
safety and creativity. Sora's release has been delayed due to
technical and ethical considerations. 

 FIGMA'S FIRST DRAFT AI FEATURE IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Figma's First Draft offers AI-powered design by assembling
pre-existing components from libraries like the Simple Design System.
It generates clean, detailed screens but struggles with cohesive
multi-screen flows. The tool highlights the importance of mastering
design principles, user flows, and strategies to complement
AI-generated designs. 

 PIXEL STUDIO IS THE EASIEST (IF NOT THE BEST) WAY TO MAKE AI ART ON
YOUR PIXEL 9 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pixel Studio on the Google Pixel 9 lets users create AI art with
prompts and preset styles. However, it lacks advanced customization
and cannot generate images of people, making tools like Google Gemini
or ChatGPT with DALL-E 3 better for detailed creations.

 4 PRACTICAL STEPS TO RECOVER YOUR LOST CREATIVITY (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Creativity thrives on mindful, intentional practices that nurture
problem-solving. It takes care and preparation to overcome blocks.
Pausing, defining, being mindful, and making positive changes can help
cultivate optimal conditions, clarify goals, stay present, and align
with your creative practice. 

 UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS OF DESIGN SYSTEMS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems offer consistency and efficiency but come with
challenges. Accessibility isn't automatic and unique components may
not fit. Not everyone adopts or uses systems effectively. Overwhelming
options and complex features can hinder usability. Iteration,
training, and balancing functionality with user experience are crucial
for success and fostering broader adoption. 

 DATA-INFORMED, NOT DATA-DRIVEN (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Relying solely on data for decision-making can sometimes end badly
due to inherent data collection and interpretation biases. Adopting a
data-informed approach, which combines data with human judgment and
experience, leads to more balanced and effective decision-making. This
method encourages critical thinking, cross-functional collaboration,
and awareness of biases, enhancing overall decision quality.
