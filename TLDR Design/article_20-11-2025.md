OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 GOOD VISUAL DESIGN, EXPLAINED (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Appealing visual design relies on four core principles: aligning
elements to a grid for cohesive layouts, establishing clear
typographic hierarchy through strategic sizing, using intentional
color palettes (often monochromatic for accessibility), and employing
purposeful imagery that conveys brand identity without clutter.
Real-site examples from Seed.com, Flamingo Estate, and Figma Shortcut
demonstrate how limiting designs to three type sizes and two main
colors creates balance and visual hierarchy. These deliberate
choices—not chance—form the foundation of beautiful, usable
interfaces. 

 SLOTS IN DESIGN SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design systems benefit from slots—designated areas within
components where custom content can be inserted—which balance fixed
constraints with flexible customization options. Slots enable
designers and developers to compose content within components like
Modals, Cards, and Rows while maintaining consistent surrounding
layout and styling, and they can nest across multiple levels from
small UI elements up through entire page templates. As Figma adds
native slot support, teams face architectural challenges around slot
depth, quantity, code alignment, and permissiveness, but thoughtful
implementation promises improved flexibility without sacrificing
system consistency. 

 THE LIFE CYCLE OF AN IDEA (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The life cycle of an idea isn't a linear pipeline but a dynamic,
cyclical process shaped by context, organizational climate, and
constantly changing inputs. Success depends less on rigid frameworks
and more on preserving the idea's story, letting learning guide
decisions, and accepting that some ideas must die. Clarity, evidence,
and adaptability should be maintained across teams, even as AI and
other forces accelerate change.

 DAVID KELLEY'S BRIEF BUT SPECTACULAR TAKE ON CREATIVITY AND DESIGN (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 David Kelley, founder of Stanford's d.school and design pioneer,
built his career helping people rediscover their innate creativity.
His approach centers on removing psychological blocks rather than
teaching creativity, believing everyone has creative capacity that's
often suppressed by discouraging experiences. Now considered essential
to solving major problems alongside business and technology,
human-centered design has moved from "the kids table to the adult
table."
