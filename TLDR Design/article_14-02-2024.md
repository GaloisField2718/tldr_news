 CREATING VARIATIONS OF ICON STYLES (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mastering the conversion from line icons to solid icons contributes
significantly to the versatility of a system. When converting line
icons to solid icons, designers should increase the thickness of lines
inwards to maintain the size of the icon, turn inner lines into gaps,
reduce the visual weight, distribute spaces evenly, and keep some
shapes outlined. 

 THE CASE FOR DESIGN ENGINEERS, PT. II (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pixels are static representations of a dynamic form. Therefore, we
are not delivering the actual product. Code-based design is superior
in that sense. It doesn't result in one artifact that approximates the
final deliverable that then requires translation into the deliverable
itself. Instead, the artifact is the deliverable. 

 SHAPING THE FUTURE OF DESIGN (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Technology changes too fast for designers to ground their work on
current interaction paradigms. Human nature remains remarkably stable,
regardless of how we interact with each other and the world. When
considered together, it‚Äôs possible to develop timeless design skills
by focusing on something other than UI.

 HOW TO CREATE THE PERFECT ICON (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When evaluating existing icons, designers should consider whether
they‚Äôre recognizable, consistent with style, and legible at all
sizes. In this article, the design team behind Streamline shares its
meticulous design process for icons with us. 

 A 4-STEP FRAMEWORK FOR CRAFTING MEANINGFUL DESIGNS (7 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Meaningful design starts with content, considers structure or how the
content will be organized and grouped, defines the layout, and adds
style ‚Äî colors, typography, and images. 

 NAMES ARE COMPLEX: DISPLAYING INITIALS FOR AN AVATAR COMPONENT IN A
DESIGN SYSTEM (19 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Avatar components are not designed with people with two names or
non-Latin characters in mind. Potential solutions for these edge cases
and others include allowing a maximum of three initials, taking the
last word for the last name, and disregarding numbers, non-Latin
characters, and emojis.
