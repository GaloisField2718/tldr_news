 YOUTUBE TURNS 20 AND UNVEILS A NEW GLOBAL MARKETING IDENTITY (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a new global
marketing identity designed in-house to unify its expanding ecosystem
across Shorts, Music, TV, Premium, and Kids. The refresh centers on
making the brand feel "alive" through a reactive, dynamic system that
responds to real content and culture, featuring a new custom typeface,
bespoke illustrations, and motion behaviors. Rather than reinventing
the platform, the identity evolves familiar elements like the
red-white-black palette and UI cues to feel more expressive while
maintaining consistency across global markets. 

 OPENAI TEASES HARDWARE UNVEIL THIS YEAR AS JONY IVE'S TEAM HIRES MORE
APPLE ALUMNI (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI plans to unveil its first hardware product in the second half
of 2026, though it may not go on sale until later, aligning with
expectations of a 2027 launch. Meanwhile, Jony Ive's “io” team at
OpenAI has hired Apple veteran Janum Trivedi, strengthening its design
talent as it works on a likely audio-focused AI device. 

 NETFLIX IS ROLLING OUT A LIVE VOTING FEATURE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Netflix is introducing a live voting feature that lets viewers
interact with livestreamed programming in real time, launching with
the debut of its talent show Star Search on January 20. Viewers can
vote using a TV remote or the Netflix app through multiple-choice
selections or five-star ratings, with votes counted instantly and
limited to the live broadcast window. The rollout builds on earlier
tests and signals Netflix's continued push to merge live content with
interactive, cross-device experiences.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WITH APPLE CREATOR STUDIO, ARE MAC ICONS GETTING WORSE? (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Apple's increasingly minimal Mac icons, especially the new Apple
Creator Studio set, are being widely criticized as confusing and
meaningless, with many arguing they've lost clarity as they moved from
skeuomorphism to abstraction. The author disagrees, saying icons
rarely make sense without prior knowledge anyway, and that what really
matters is visual distinctiveness—something the new, colorful ACS
icons do well while also looking more aesthetically pleasing. 

 AI MODEL COLLAPSE IN DESIGN TOOLS: WHY YOUR BACKGROUND REMOVER IS
GETTING WORSE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When machine learning systems are trained on AI-generated content,
quality deteriorates within 5 training cycles, leading to worse
outputs over time. As a result, background removers, image generators,
and writing assistants now produce inconsistent results, homogenized
outputs, and increased artifacts. Designers must implement multi-stage
quality checks, version-pin reliable tools, maintain human-curated
reference libraries, and build manual fallbacks since AI outputs can
no longer be trusted by default. 

 FOCUS ON QUALITY INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN VOLUME (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An introverted senior designer in Jakarta struggles to communicate
and delegate to a younger Gen Z team, worrying about causing stress
and feeling blocked by age and interest gaps. The advice: understand
and share your own communication preferences, ask your manager to help
reset inclusive team communication norms, lean on written channels and
structured agendas, and focus on quality, thoughtful interactions
rather than forced small talk.

 INTRODUCING TASTE 1.0: A MODEL FOR DESIGNERS (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Taste 1.0 is a design system model consisting of structured markdown
files that encode organizational design decisions, token rules, and
component conventions to guide AI-generated outputs. The approach
shifts the focus from selecting better AI models to building
intelligent routing systems that leverage specialized agents and
shared knowledge graphs, with task-specific guidelines to maintain
consistency. Organizations should start with core foundation files
that define tokens, patterns, and governance rules, then route design
tasks to appropriate specialists while validating outputs against
documented standards. 

 DESIGN IN CODE, GET PRAISE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A designer working on a large government case-working system redesign
demonstrated new flows to product managers using an HTML prototype
built with the GOV.UK Prototype Kit instead of Figma. The interactive,
browser-based prototype allowed stakeholders to experience the
end-to-end user journey, including transitions, loading states, and
error handling, which static design tools can't effectively
demonstrate. Product managers praised the functional prototype for
helping them better understand the designs and for providing clearer
guidance to developers than traditional design presentations. 

 BEYOND CHAT: 8 CORE USER INTENTS DRIVING AI INTERACTION (15 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Most AI products still default to chat, but this breaks down for real
work. Instead, teams should design around clear user intents and match
each to the right UI, not bolt chat onto everything. The article
defines eight core intents (Learn, Create, Delegate, Oversee, Monitor,
Find, Play, and Connect) plus “meta-intent” behavior sliders,
arguing that great AI products are purpose-built for these workflows,
with transparent, safe, and reversible design.

 RETHINKING “PIXEL PERFECT” WEB DESIGN (12 MINUTE READ) [17]

accessibility needs constantly change.
