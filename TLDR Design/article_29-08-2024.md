 THE MOST EXPERIMENTAL LOGO OF THE YEAR WAS GROWN FROM LIVE BACTERIA
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crucible's innovative new logo, designed by Madalena Studio, was
grown from live bacteria using natural processes. Developed in a
makeshift incubator, the evolving design reflects Crucible's
experimental approach to drinks and brand identity. The result
features a variety of unique, organic options that capture the brand's
dynamic and unconventional nature. 

 GOOGLE MAPS ROLLING OUT REDESIGNED PIN SHAPE AND COLORS (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google Maps has updated its pin design with shorter, more rounded
shapes and a white background. The category icon is housed in an inner
circle, replacing the traditional pointy-bottom pins. Most pin colors
remain the same, though some categories, like museums, now use purple
instead of teal. These design changes, including softer color tweaks,
aim to improve map visibility and functionality. This server-side
redesign is rolling out across Android, iOS, and the web,
complementing previous updates like the simplified bottom bar and new
map colors. 

 DONALD TRUMP'S NFT TRADING CARDS ARE BACK AND CRINGIER THAN EVER (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Donald Trump has launched a series of digital trading cards that
place him in various hyper-patriotic and exaggerated scenarios. The
design of these cards, which resemble outputs from a basic AI image
generator, offers an over-the-top and amusingly self-flattering
portrayal of Trump. These new 'America First' edition NFTs have
garnered attention, continuing the odd trend since their initial
release in late 2022. Despite their peculiar design, there remains a
surprising demand for these Trump-themed NFTs.

 THE 80/20 RULE IN DESIGN JOB INTERVIEWS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 How can designers perform exceptionally well in design job
interviews? The key word is ‚Äúpreparation.‚Äù They should use the
80/20 rule to put 80% of their effort into preparing for the case
study presentation (20%) and the remaining 20% for the other 80% of
questions, which aren't trivial and shouldn't be neglected. 

 PRACTICAL DESIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Good design improves everyday items by making them more functional.
For instance, placing expiration dates on food packaging enhances
convenience, reduces food waste, and improves customer satisfaction.
Despite resistance due to aesthetics, examples like Muji show that
practical design changes can be effective and visually appealing. 

 WHY AREN'T THERE MORE UX SOCIOLOGISTS OUT THERE? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX design often emphasizes individual psychology but can benefit from
incorporating sociological insights to understand broader societal
forces. Balancing psychological and sociological perspectives can lead
to more effective, socially meaningful designs, especially as digital
products increasingly impact society.
