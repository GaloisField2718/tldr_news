NEWS & TRENDS

 DOMINO'S SERVES UP A FRESH SLICE OF BRANDING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Domino's has unveiled its first rebrand in over a decade. Featuring
brighter red and blue colors, a custom Domino's Sans typeface,
simplified packaging, and a new jingle by Shaboozey, the update
modernizes the brand while keeping its familiar logo, blending bold
visuals and sound to refresh its identity without losing its core
appeal. 

 IMPROVING ACCESSIBILITY ACROSS FIGMA (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma introduced over 15 accessibility improvements across its design
tools, expanding keyboard-only controls for tasks like rotating
objects, managing comments, and adjusting FigJam elements. The updates
enhance screen reader reliability with clearer announcements, richer
object descriptions, and better support for formatted text. New
toggles enable users to customize shortcut behavior and auto-follow
settings during work. 

 JAPANESE GOVERNMENT CALLS ON SORA 2 MAKER OPENAI TO REFRAIN FROM
COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Japan's government formally requested OpenAI to stop copyright
infringement after Sora 2 generated videos featuring characters from
anime, manga, and games like Pokémon and Mario. Minister Minoru
Kiuchi called these characters "irreplaceable treasures" and warned
that Japan's AI Promotion Act could be invoked if the issue persists.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promised to give rightsholders more control over
character generation, but no formal response to Japan's request has
been issued yet.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW MANY DESIGNERS START PRESENTATIONS OFF ON THE BACK FOOT (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Designers often fail in presentations by treating them like
old-fashioned car sales, expecting stakeholders to make costly
decisions within minutes without proper preparation or context.
Success requires pre-meeting groundwork: sharing agendas or executive
summaries beforehand, understanding each stakeholder's motivations,
and clearly prioritizing which issues matter most when resources are
limited. Major decisions aren't made during presentations but through
extensive preparation that helps executives feel informed rather than
pressured, similar to how modern car buyers research thoroughly before
visiting dealerships. 

 THE IMPORTANCE OF TASTE, AND OTHER LIES WE TELL OURSELVES (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 “Taste” is the wrong word to describe what truly separates human
creativity from AI. Instead, what matters is judgment—a skill
developed through time, experience, and critique. Drawing from art
school lessons and years in design quality comes from effort and
reflection, not instant output or surface-level style. AI can assist
like a tool, but only human judgment—shaped by hours of
practice—defines what “good” looks like. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HOT STREAK GAME DESIGN: HOW TO KEEP PLAYERS COMING
BACK EVERY DAY WITHOUT SHAME (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Game designers can keep players engaged through streak mechanics by
leveraging psychological principles like loss aversion and dopamine
anticipation, but success requires ethical implementation with
flexible recovery systems rather than exploitative pressure tactics.
Duolingo's approach demonstrates that lowering barriers to consistency
increases long-term engagement by 40% while supporting genuine habit
formation. The key distinction between helpful and harmful design lies
in prioritizing user autonomy and sustainable habits over pure
engagement metrics, using collaborative social features and
transparent recovery options instead of guilt-driven dark patterns.

 THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO THE CONTENT DESIGN PROCESS (7 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Content design involves understanding user needs and creating
appropriate content solutions, primarily through writing but also via
charts, videos, and other formats that best communicate information. A
structured content design process ensures designers collaborate from a
project's beginning, integrating words and messages with visual design
rather than cramming content into predetermined boxes late in
development. The seven-step process involves understanding the
problem, defining user needs, mapping user journeys, collaborative
drafting, iteration, testing, and finalization for implementation, all
supported by tools like Figma, Notion, and AI assistants. 

 COM­PRESSED FLU­ID TYPOGRAPHY (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Fluid typography on the web typically assumes a 16px base font size,
but when users increase their browser's default font size for
accessibility, headlines can become disproportionately large and break
the design hierarchy. A new experimental approach introduces a
"compressed" typographic scale using a CSS calc() factor that divides
the assumed base by the actual base font size, dampening the ratio as
font size increases. This compression prevents oversized headings
while still allowing body text to scale appropriately. 

 DESIGNERS MUST SPEAK UP TO CHANGE UNFAIR IP LAWS (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 The UK government's consultation on updating design law aims to
modernize protection and enforcement, but leaves uncertainty about
whether it will truly help independent designers facing copycat
issues. Advocates argue for stronger unregistered design
rights—potentially including criminal penalties for intentional
infringement—and better alignment of policy with the creative
sector. The review seeks to simplify and future-proof the system while
excluding AI-generated designs, but critics warn that without real
deterrents and accessibility, large companies will continue to exploit
smaller designers unchecked.

 DESIGNERS MUST SPEAK UP TO CHANGE UNFAIR IP LAWS (4 MINUTE READ) [15]

over individual creators.
