NEWS & TRENDS

 TRUMP SELECTS AIRBNB CO-FOUNDER JOE GEBBIA AS INAUGURAL US CHIEF
DESIGN OFFICER (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a
National Design Studio and selected Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia as
the inaugural US Chief Design Officer. The three-year initiative,
called "America by Design," aims to modernize federal services by
improving usability, visual design, and overall user experience across
government websites and physical locations. Gebbia will coordinate
with federal agencies, recruit design experts, and standardize design
practices to reduce duplication while ensuring compliance with digital
experience requirements. 

 META PARTNERS WITH MIDJOURNEY ON AI IMAGE AND VIDEO MODELS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Meta partnered with Midjourney to license the startup's AI image and
video generation technology, with Meta's research teams collaborating
to integrate it into future AI models and products. The licensing deal
helps Meta compete with leading AI visual models like OpenAI's Sora
and Google's Veo, marking another strategic move in Meta's aggressive
AI expansion following major talent acquisitions and investments.
Midjourney remains independent despite the partnership, maintaining
its position as a leading AI image generator that has never taken
outside funding. 

 FOLDABLE IPHONE COMING NEXT YEAR TO FEATURE FOUR CAMERAS, TOUCH ID,
APPLE CELLULAR MODEM (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's first foldable iPhone, coming in 2026, will open like a book
with an 8-inch inner display, feature four cameras, use Touch ID on
the side button instead of Face ID due to thinness limits, and include
Apple's C2 modem without a SIM slot. It is expected to launch in black
and white only and priced above $1,800. A redesigned all-glass Pro
iPhone is planned for 2027.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 USING DAILY QUESTS WITHIN YOUR PRODUCT DESIGN TO BOOST RETENTION (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Zeigarnik effect, where people remember unfinished tasks better
than completed ones, creates mental tension that drives users to seek
closure and return to incomplete activities. Companies like Apple
Watch, Duolingo, TikTok, and meditation apps successfully leverage
this through features like fitness rings, daily streaks, social
notifications, and progress trackers that maintain a sense of
incompleteness. 

 ARE AI-GENERATED SYNTHETIC USERS REPLACING PERSONAS? WHAT UX
DESIGNERS NEED TO KNOW (29 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-generated personas offer speed and cost efficiency but lack the
depth and accuracy of research-backed personas built from real user
insights. While synthetic users can serve as useful proto-personas for
initial exploration and desk research, they rely on assumptions and
averaged internet data that miss the messy complexity of actual human
behavior. The Nielsen Norman Group's testing confirmed that AI
personas provide shallow, overly positive responses compared to real
participants who reveal critical nuances, barriers, and authentic
usage patterns that prevent design failures. 

 RAYCAST FOR DESIGNERS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Raycast is a powerful productivity launcher for Mac and Windows that
streamlines workflows with features like advanced window management,
clipboard history, quick links, notes, snippets, and AI presets. Its
extensive ecosystem of native and third-party extensions (for Slack,

indispensable for designers, developers, and product managers who want

READ) [13] 

 Strategic color and typography pairings create cohesive website

 WHAT MAKES A GOOD LOGO? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A logo serves as visual shorthand for a brand, deriving meaning from
the quality of what it represents rather than the mark itself.
Compelling logos require strategic alignment with brand goals and must
be distinctive, visible, adaptable, memorable, universal, timeless,
and simple, prioritizing clarity over complexity. Most logo failures
stem from a lack of brand clarity, leading to overdesigned marks that
try to communicate everything instead of distilling the brand's
essence with confident restraint.
