 Google's Material 3 Expressive redesign of the Clock app has leaked
ahead of I/O 2025. The leaks show a cleaner modern interface made with
Jetpack Compose. Updates include a new bottom bar, renamed tabs,
bigger text buttons, and simpler alarm and timer layouts. While
navigation has been improved, features like the Stopwatch's large
buttons have received mixed early reactions.

 APPLE'S NEW WEB PAGE LEAVES USERS BAFFLED (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has launched Snapshot, a minimalist web feature that showcases
brief celebrity bios and links to related content across Apple's apps.
Users and critics have found it underwhelming, criticizing its lack of
functionality, impersonal feel, and limited scope. Many view it as a
superficial attempt at promotion rather than innovation, drawing
comparisons to past features Apple released without clear user demand.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BIG TECH (23 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agile methods are often misunderstood and oversimplified as they
spread beyond engineering. When scaled across whole organizations,
they can blur strategy and ignore core business needs. In today's
startup culture, this often leads to skipping deep market research and
expert insight, both key to understanding customers and making smart
decisions. 

 YOU CAN BE A GREAT DESIGNER AND BE COMPLETELY UNKNOWN (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 True creative greatness is often seen as rare and tied to fame, but
many outstanding designers work quietly, solving problems so well they
go unnoticed. In a recognition-driven world, this skews our idea of
success and overlooks quiet excellence. Real design greatness lies in
impact, integrity, and usefulness, not visibility. 

 UNDERSTAND YOUR IMAGINATION GAP (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers often face a gap between their ideas and what organizations
can actually do, which can be frustrating but shouldn't be taken
personally. Every workplace has limits on change and decision-making,
no matter how good the ideas are. Instead of seeing this gap as
negative, designers can view it as a natural part of the creative
process and value their role.

 SERGEANT WALNUTS' NEW MANCHESTER BUILDING SOCIETY IDENTITY IS ROOTED
IN ITS HOME CITY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Manchester Building Society's bold new rebrand by Sergeant Walnuts
features a colorful Greater Manchester map and a modern ‘M' logo. It
reflects local pride, breaks from generic banking, and marks a fresh
start after the 2023 merger with Newcastle Building Society. With a
flagship branch and expansion ahead, it stresses accessibility and
regional focus. 

 DESIGNING THROUGH UNCERTAINTY (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Uncertainty isn't a problem in design but the reason it exists. When
embraced, it opens space for growth, creativity, and change. Designers
aim for clarity through research and testing but must accept that full
certainty is impossible when serving evolving human needs. Seeing
uncertainty as part of the process builds resilience, adaptability,
and focus. 

 PROMPT SUGGESTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Prompt suggestions in AI tools guide users, show capabilities, and
ease the "blank page" problem. There are three types: use-case prompts
that show what the AI can do, autocomplete prompts that speed up
input, and follow-up questions that keep the chat going. Well-designed
suggestions lower mental effort, spark ideas, and improve prompt
quality, but must stay relevant to work well.
