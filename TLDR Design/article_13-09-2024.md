 MEET VERSE, AN AI-POWERED CREATIVE APP THAT HELPS GEN Z DESIGN AND
PUBLISH EXPRESSIVE CONTENT (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Verse, an iOS app, enables Gen Z to create hyper-visual content on an
interactive canvas with AI. It enables users to design mini websites
for mood boards, invitations, storefronts, and fan pages. Founded by
Bobby Pinckney and Michelle Yin, the app launched in June and has
amassed over 200,000 creations. An Android version and web tools are

 APPLE PARTNERS WITH THIRD PARTIES, LIKE GOOGLE, ON IPHONE 16'S VISUAL
SEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Introduced at its "It's Glowtime" event, Apple's new "Visual
Intelligence" feature enhances visual search via the iPhone 16's
Camera Control button. It enables access to Google's search engine and
other third-party tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, directly from the
camera interface for varied tasks. 

 FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM ARE MAKING AI LABELS LESS PROMINENT ON EDITED
CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is revising how it labels AI-edited content on Instagram,
Facebook, and Threads. The new "AI Info" tag will now be within a menu
in the top-right corner of AI-edited images and videos instead of
beneath the user's name, allowing users to check for AI adjustments
using industry signals like Adobe's Content Credentials and Google's
SynthID digital watermarks. This change aims to reflect the extent of
AI usage better while addressing previous criticism for mislabeling
genuine photos as AI-generated. The adjustment will start next week.

 WHY ANTICIPATORY DESIGN ISN'T WORKING FOR BUSINESSES (18 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Anticipatory design, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine
learning (ML), and Big Data (BD), promises to transform user
experiences by predicting and fulfilling needs before users even
express them. While this proactive approach seems revolutionary, many
businesses struggle to meet the high expectations it sets. 

 USE BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS DATA TO MAKE YOUR SITE MORE EFFECTIVE (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Behavioral analytics provide insights into user behavior on websites
or apps, helping identify engagement patterns, prioritize content or
features, and improve user journeys. Although they don't explain why
users behave a certain way, these analytics offer a quick,
cost-effective way to understand user actions, enhancing engagement
and conversions. 

 HAPPY SELLING! (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Innovation designers can boost sales and refresh go-to-market
strategies by using advanced technologies to create customer-focused
solutions, enhancing client relationships and satisfaction.
Integrating designers into sales teams improves sales effectiveness by
making complex technologies user-friendly. They address real customer
needs with empathy, aligning sales with customer priorities and
fostering long-term client retention through lean research,
collaborative design, and storytelling.
