 GOOGLE'S AI MODE GETS BETTER AT UNDERSTANDING VISUAL PROMPTS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's AI Mode now better understands visual search prompts through
an enhanced "query fan-out" technique, which runs multiple background
searches to interpret complex requests, such as "moody but maximalist"
bedrooms. The update makes the chatbot multimodal, allowing users to
initiate conversations with images or videos and receive more visual
responses rather than text-heavy answers. These improvements
particularly benefit shopping searches, enabling AI Mode to handle
nuanced queries such as "barrel jeans that aren't too baggy" with
refinable follow-up questions. 

 APPLE GLASSES ARE COMING: HERE'S EVERY RUMORED NEW FEATURE (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple is developing AI-driven Apple Glasses expected in 2026, with
release likely in 2027. The first version will lack a display or AR
features, focusing instead on visual intelligence, Siri voice control,
multiple cameras, health tracking, and deep iPhone integration.
Powered by a low-power chip and built-in speakers, the glasses will
function as an iPhone accessory, with a future model reportedly
planned to include a display. 

 META PLANS TO SELL TARGETED ADS BASED ON DATA IN YOUR AI CHATS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta will use data from user interactions with its AI
products—including Meta AI chatbot conversations, Ray-Ban smart
glasses recordings, and AI-generated content—to sell targeted ads on
Facebook and Instagram starting December 16. The policy applies
globally except in South Korea, the UK, and the EU, with no opt-out
available for affected users. While Meta claims conversations about
sensitive topics won't influence ads, the company acknowledges that
it's still developing systems to leverage this AI data for its
advertising business.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHERE'S THE AI DESIGN RENAISSANCE? (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Despite 2.5 years of intense AI hype, there's no evidence that
current AI tools are making design faster, eliminating designer jobs,
or enabling the promised software renaissance—metrics like new app
releases and domain registrations remain flat. AI struggles with
designs that require tight constraints, novelty, or complexity because
its architecture is based on training data, making it best suited for
average designs rather than bold, opinionated work that stands out.
Designers should focus on out-of-training-data skills, such as
pixel-perfect UI and novel interactions, while using AI primarily for
small personal projects, internal prototypes, and simple public tools
where security and complexity are minimal. 

 BORING IS GOOD (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI language models should focus on "boring" tasks, like proofreading
and summarizing, rather than attempting high-level thinking, where
hallucinations and faulty reasoning can lead to failures. Small
language models (SLMs) are sufficient for these modest language tasks,
offering benefits such as easier ethical training and lower costs. The
industry has been using LLMs backwards by trying to automate complex
tasks from the top down instead of augmenting simpler tasks from the
bottom up. 

 HOW DO GOOD DESIGNERS GET STUCK? THEY WASTE TIME TRYING TO MIND-READ
THEIR TEAM (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Good designers often get stuck by attempting to mind-read their
team's intentions when designs are rejected, creating false narratives
like "they don't value UX" instead of addressing the real issue. This
"LoserThink" pattern prevents designers from asking whether they're
solving the actual problem their stakeholders need solved. The
solution is to replace assumptions with direct questions about success
criteria and understanding team pressures through brief conversations.

 HOW DESIGN RADICALLY TRANSFORMED A DYING INDUSTRY (6 MINUTE READ)

 Jacek Utko, a former architect turned newspaper art director,
transformed struggling newspapers into award-winning successes through

Eastern Europe boosted circulation by up to 100%, increased ad
revenue, and earned multiple international design awards, proving how
strategic design can drive both innovation and measurable business
growth.
