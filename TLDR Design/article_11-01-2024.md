(7 MINUTE READ) [14]

apologized on Sunday after using an ad with AI-generated elements. 

 TO LEAD DESIGN, YOU MUST HAVE AN AGENDA (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Agendas don't have the baggage of "vision". They also make clear that
you have a political point of view and a cause for which you're
advocating as a leader. You can share an agenda with your team or keep
one for yourself. Making this concrete will enable you to make better
decisions throughout the year since you'll have a clear organizing
principle to follow.
