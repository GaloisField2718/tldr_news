 NIKE DEVELOPING AI MODEL AS PART OF DESIGN "STEP CHANGE" (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Nike is developing a generative AI model to design products using its
vast bank of athlete data. Athlete Imagined Revolution (AIR) is a
project that saw the design team create prototype shoes for 13 of
Nike's top athletes based on their requests. Their preferences were
translated to prompts for the generative AI models, which made
hundreds of images that Nike designers then rapidly honed into single
concepts using other digital fabrication techniques.

 DESIGNING DESIGN SYSTEMS: HOW TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK THAT DRIVES
DECISION MAKING (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe's Spectrum design system is shaped by thousands of designers,
engineers, and product managers who work on one of the most complex
software portfolios on the planet. Comprehensively changing it
requires a lot of effort and coordination. In this article, Adobe's
team shares its framework for defining its evolution. The framework
includes building a community of advisors to give feedback, writing
documents to explain decisions and communicate where the design is
going, and developing principles to guide decisions. 

 WHY GOOD UX IS NO UX (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Invisible UX allows users to concentrate on what's beyond the
interface and how technology makes their lives easier. Designers
should strive for this attribute because it represents the best user
experience design and is crucial to enduring products. Create tools
that integrate seamlessly with your customers' lives by understanding
how your interface aligns with their existing behavior and knowledge,
designing maintenance-free solutions, and ensuring the product does
more work than your users. 

 USING AI TO PREDICT DESIGN TRENDS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Predictive analytics is a machine learning method for tracing
patterns in datasets and anticipating future pattern changes. The
maturation of AI will allow these processes to be automated, improving
the accuracy and actionability of trend forecasts in the design
industry. This article gives you a glimpse of how predictive analytics
will be used shortly, explaining how it works, its main strengths, and
how it will impact the design practice.

 WEB ACCESSIBILITY IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS (5 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 A close inspection of the accessibility of the 2024 US presidential
campaign sites reveals that the sites for both Biden and Trump are
better than average pages found in the WebAIM Million. Still, both
could improve significantly with simple changes that would not require
throwing out an entire widget or design. Biden's site scored 7.2 while
Trump's was rated a 6.6. 

 USE BOTH RATINGS AVERAGE AND NUMBER OF RATINGS WHEN SORTING BY USER
RATINGS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Many users sort product lists by ratings to compare items. Still, 64%
of sites neglect to include the number of ratings in sorting
algorithms, leading to distrust in highly ranked items. Combining
ratings average and number of ratings will improve sorting accuracy
and match users' preferences. 

 THE AGENTIC ERA OF UX (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The future of AI UX should prioritize holistic transformation of user
experience over addressing individual user needs, while AI agents
embedded in large language models facilitate complex tasks
autonomously. Agentic workflows, epitomized by AI models, dissect
intricate tasks into manageable steps, enhance reasoning capabilities,
and have capabilities for vastly improving the user experience.
