(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tubi's new logo keeps its purple aesthetic but swaps out the orange
and red hues for neon yellow. The new color palette aims to give
viewers a "bold and mischievous" experience. Gone is the black
background on the app's home screen display, replaced by the bright
signature purple that's part of the original design accented with
white and yellow.

 HOW TO CREATE A MEMORABLE LOGO IN 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Good design begins in your mind. To arrive at the best solution,
start by collecting and analyzing all the available info on the brand,
product, competitors, and target audience. Similar companies often
copy one another‚Äôs designs, so studying the logos from related
business sectors makes sense. 

 EXPERIENCE, NOT TECHNOLOGY (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The power of combining proactive and reactive AI lies in their
complementary abilities to anticipate and respond to needs. This
framing shifts away from AI technology mechanisms, instead emphasizing

different ways to do things within established and new categories.

 RETHINKING THE STARTUP MVP: BUILDING A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT (10 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The concept of the Minimum Viable Product has evolved. Today, it's
about refining and differentiating a product within a saturated market
by iterating based on user feedback rather than simply validating new
ideas quickly. Linear's journey in establishing its MVP illuminates
the importance of focusing on a specific user base, leveraging
waitlists to engage early adopters, and using customer feedback to
know when a product is ready for a public launch. 

 SHOW, NOT TELL: HOW TO MAKE USE OF RESTRICTED OR SCRAPPED DESIGN WORK
(7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Most working relationships involve NDAs. Remote jobs cut off access
to all documents as soon as you're laid off. You don't want to have to
beg your former colleagues for screenshots of your work. Ensure you
constantly grab copies of ongoing projects, anonymize them if
necessary, and even consider transforming them. Practicing in Public
also offers an exciting alternative where you write articles or create
YouTube videos showcasing your knowledge and experience.
