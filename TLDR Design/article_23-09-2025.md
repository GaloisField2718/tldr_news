NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA RENDERING: POWERED BY WEBGPU (11 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma upgraded its rendering engine from WebGL to WebGPU to unlock
new performance optimizations, requiring significant changes to its
graphics interface and shader processing systems. The transition
involved creating explicit draw-call arguments, implementing uniform
buffer batching, and building a dynamic fallback system to handle
device compatibility issues. After extensive testing across multiple
device types and careful rollout monitoring, Figma successfully
deployed WebGPU while maintaining performance baselines and enabling
future optimizations like compute shaders. 

 FRAMER DESIGN PAGES (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Framer's Design Pages transforms the platform from a web builder into
a comprehensive design tool with features like vector editing, P3
colors, and advanced masking. The new freeform canvas allows designers
to experiment without worrying about responsiveness, then convert
iterations into web pages with one click. Design Pages are completely
free with unlimited projects and pages, and integrate with Wireframer
for generating layouts. 

 CHROME IS GOOGLE'S FIRST IPHONE APP WITH LIQUID GLASS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google Chrome 141 for iOS introduced Liquid Glass design updates,
including a refreshed Tab Grid, modernized context menus, rounded
corners in sheets and settings, a new pinwheel-style tab loader, and a
floating keyboard shortcut bar. The changes highlight Chrome's unique
iOS interface. Most other Google apps remain split between older
Material Theme and newer Material 3 designs.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 RIP DESIGN AGENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI has fundamentally broken the traditional design agency model by
enabling cheap, fast, and high-quality work simultaneously for the
first time. The proposed "Anti-Design Agency" approach embraces AI
tools, works transparently in public, and charges lower prices due to
increased efficiency. Traditional agencies that ignore AI will become
irrelevant as designers who leverage AI can deliver faster results at
more accessible price points. 

 THE RIGHT SIZE PROJECT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Freelancers and small agencies should focus on "right-sized" projects
rather than chasing big jobs they're not ready for. The key is
delivering 10× ROI by charging clients 10% of the value created—for
example, charging $1,000 for work that generates $10,000 in revenue or
savings. Success comes from starting with smaller projects where you
can guarantee outsized results, then gradually scaling up as you build
proof and confidence in delivering larger value. 

 WELCOME TO THE ENTRY-LEVEL VOID: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN JUNIOR DESIGN JOBS
DISAPPEAR? (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Entry-level design jobs are disappearing as AI, budget cuts, and
remote work erode traditional apprenticeships, leaving newcomers to
rely on unpaid gigs, cold outreach, and self-driven projects. What
emerges is an uneven system where only the well-connected or
persistent succeed, while AI accelerates learning but risks weakening
creative foundations—pushing originality, peer networks, and
self-started paths to replace the old career ladder.

 CHAMPIONING QUALITY THROUGH CULTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Quality emerges from well-designed systems and processes rather than
being added at the end of projects. When systems enforce excellence
and collaboration, teams can move quickly without sacrificing
standards because clarity becomes built into every checkpoint.
Building this culture requires long-term investment in feedback loops
and accountability, making quality a natural byproduct rather than a
competing priority with speed. 

 DESIGNING LOOPS, NOT PATHS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Traditional workflow-based design is too rigid for real-world
unpredictability, while loop-based systems use continuous feedback to
sense, decide, act, and adapt. By keeping humans in the loop and
enabling nested layers of oversight, these systems build resilience,
foster trust, and support smarter, more flexible collaboration between
people and AI. 

 "SOME UK BRANDS ARE DEFINITELY TIRED," KOTO'S JAMES GREENFIELD ON THE
STATE OF BRANDING TODAY (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Koto's James Greenfield argues that strong branding requires
discipline, distinctiveness, and context—work should feel
“uncopyable,” evolve or revolutionize depending on a brand's
state, and reflect real consumer experiences. From lessons in Amazon's
refresh to critiques of UK legacy brands, he stresses that creativity
with attitude, long-term thinking, and storytelling rooted in culture
and business realities are what make brands memorable and trusted.
