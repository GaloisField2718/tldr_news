 GOOGLE PHOTOS AND MAPS LOGOS ARE REPORTEDLY CHANGING. SEE THE NEW
ICONS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google is reportedly updating the logos for Google Maps and Google
Photos with a new gradient color scheme. The changes are subtle,
maintaining the familiar logos while introducing smooth gradient
colors that mirror Google's recent rebranding effort, which highlights
AI capabilities. Google previously updated its main logo in September
with similar gradient styling, stating the brighter design reflected
"the surge of AI-driven innovation" across its products. 

 TEMPO'S $5M SEED TO EMPOWER THE DESIGN ENGINEERING MOVEMENT (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Tempo raised $5 million in seed funding from Golden Ventures, Y
Combinator, Box Group, and other investors to build a design tool that
enables designers to work directly with production codebases. The tool
addresses the disconnect between design and engineering by providing
an infinite canvas where teams collaborate on real production code
using actual design system components, eliminating traditional
hand-offs. Tempo aims to empower the emerging design engineer role
while maintaining precision and manual control that professional
designers need beyond AI prompting alone. 

 OLED MACBOOK PRO REDESIGN MAY BE EXCLUSIVE TO M6 PRO AND M6 MAX
MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is planning a redesigned MacBook Pro with OLED, touch support,
and a thinner chassis, but it will only come to the higher-end M6
Pro/Max models expected between late 2026 and early 2027. The base
14-inch MacBook Pro will stick with the current design for at least
another year, meaning buyers who want the redesign must choose a
higher-end model.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WE MADE DESIGN EFFICIENT AND KILLED THE MAGIC (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Visual design in tech has become standardized and soulless, with most
products adopting the same safe aesthetics—clean layouts, sans-serif
fonts, rounded corners—because efficiency-driven workflows
prioritize repeatability over creative exploration. A new generation
of companies, such as Framer, Linear, and Notion, is rediscovering
that a visual identity creates a competitive advantage, investing in
distinctive aesthetics that communicate personality and maturity. The
future belongs to designers who use taste and conviction to create
products with character, not just polish, making visual design a
strategic differentiator rather than decoration. 

 "HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?" AFFINITY REVEALS HOW IT'S ABLE TO GO
100% FREE FOREVER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Affinity's three creative apps have been merged into one free,
permanently available app, resulting in over a million downloads in
the first week. Canva says there's no catch—no data selling or AI
training on user files. Wider pro adoption of free Affinity will
ultimately drive more designers toward Canva, making the move a
long-term bet on creative freedom rather than a subscription-driven
model. 

 IS FIGMA IN ITS ACCESSIBILITY ERA? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most design tools remain inaccessible—even to the users who rely on
them—because they were built around outdated assumptions that users
are able-bodied, well-sighted mouse users. Figma is breaking that
pattern by adding enhanced contrast modes and real keyboard
navigation, proving that meaningful accessibility retrofits are
possible, while highlighting how inaccessible tools limit who can
design, reinforce exclusion, and hinder the industry's ability to
produce inclusive products.

 YOU'RE NOT BAD AT PRESENTING; YOU JUST HAVEN'T MASTERED THE RIGHT WAY
(YET) (31 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Presenting is a learnable skill, not an innate talent, and most
professionals struggle with it because they've been taught
surface-level tips rather than tools for managing nerves and building
genuine connections. The real fear isn't public speaking itself, but
losing control and being misunderstood. Confidence emerges when
presenters shift from self-monitoring to actively listening to their
audience, using the same conversational instincts they already possess
in everyday interactions to create meaning and drive action. 

 LOS YORK'S PIXEL-BASED SYSTEM GIVES NETFLIX'S EYELINE A BOLD NEW
VISION (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The new Eyeline identity centers on the pixel as the core building
block—a metaphor for creativity and technology—forming a modular
grid system that scales seamlessly across its VFX, Studios, and Labs
divisions, each distinguished by RGB color coding. With a typographic
mix of Netflix Sans and ITC Garamond and a clean, minimal visual
approach, Los York created a flexible, future-ready brand that avoids
VFX clichés while unifying Eyeline's global teams and celebrating
both its technical precision and cinematic creativity.
