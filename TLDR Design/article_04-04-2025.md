[7] 

 Adobe GenStudio streamlines performance marketing by integrating
creative and marketing workflows. Its success relied on a robust
design strategy, aligning stakeholders through research,
visualization, and strategic facilitation. Understanding business
goals, technology, and future trends helped create an intuitive
product. Conviction-building, clarity, and collaboration were
essential in driving adoption and innovation. 

 A SPIRITED DEBATE AROUND AI (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style images have flooded social media,
but like all internet trends, this will pass. The real issue lies in
copyright debates, intent, and commercialization. AI challenges
artistic norms, sparking discussions on monetization rather than bans.
Artists must engage as AI-driven creativity reshapes the economy and
artistic value. 

 DESIGN AT THE SPEED OF THOUGHT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-powered coding has transformed design by removing technical
friction, shifting the focus from execution to clarity of thought.
Designers must now refine their vision, articulate intent precisely,
and embrace a new role as conductors of creativity rather than mere
tool operators.

 BADGES VS. PILLS VS. CHIPS VS. TAGS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 UI design relies on both static and interactive components. Badges
