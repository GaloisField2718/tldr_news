 GOING FROM DESIGNER TO DESIGN MANAGER IN AN ORGANIZATION WITH A LOW
DESIGN MATURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Transitioning from a designer to a design manager in organizations
needing more design maturity presents challenges. Designers often
defend their decisions, while managers must justify the team's
fundamental value. These struggles are observed in organizations
categorized at lower levels of design maturity, suggesting underlying
cultural issues rather than solely communication or strategic
shortcomings.

trendy aesthetics and flashy packaging, the essence of design as a
problem-solving process is overlooked in pursuit of profit. This piece
emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in design. It
encourages designers to contribute positively to pressing global
issues and outlines resources for those seeking to make an impact
through their work.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DECLARATIVE DESIGN (31 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Design tools are typically imperative, allowing us to create
pixel-perfect interfaces. In contrast, CSS is a declarative language
that sets boundary conditions and lets the browser handle the details.
Some designers avoid CSS at all costs, while others jump into
designing in the browser. However, an exciting alternative is to use
the browser to make design decisions instead of creating on it. 

 KEEP IT TOGETHER: 5 ESSENTIAL DESIGN PATTERNS FOR DEV TOOL UIS (10
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tabs must be distinct, flexible, and intuitive for multitasking,
while toolbars should prioritize common actions without overcrowding
or inconsistency. Navigation sidebars should be well-organized,
collapsible, searchable, and customizable. Properties panels need to
be clear, concise, and easily accessible for attribute editing. 

 TRANSPARENT BORDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Removing borders with CSS can pose accessibility issues, especially
in high contrast mode. Setting border color: transparency enables
changing border color without affecting the box model. It is helpful
for hover effects without layout alterations. This approach also aids
in themeable design systems by offering flexibility for various brands
and themes, reducing misalignment and unexpected behavior caused by
different border widths, and minimizing QA efforts.
