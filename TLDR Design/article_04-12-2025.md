NEWS & TRENDS

 DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING WITH INTERACTIVE IMAGES IN GEMINI (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Gemini introduced interactive images that let users tap or click on
parts of diagrams to access definitions, explanations, and deeper
content about complex academic concepts. This feature transforms
studying from passive viewing into active exploration, allowing
learners to gain more information and ask follow-up questions. The
capability makes learning more visual, dynamic, and accessible by
moving beyond simple text and static images. 

 ANIMATED FLOW DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ARRIVED ON MOBBIN (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Mobbin has launched animated interface previews, giving UX/UI
designers the ability to view interfaces as interactive flows rather
than static screenshots. The new feature shows real motion and
behavior—transitions, button states, message animations, and
navigation responses—making it easier to understand how an
experience truly works, not just how it looks. While the animations
are heavier to load and not every flow is available yet, the update
offers designers far more realistic, “live” references for shaping
smoother, more user-friendly products. 

 APPLE'S NEW FONT BOOK ICON IS UPSETTING DESIGNERS (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Apple's new Liquid Glass design language has sparked major debate in
the UI community, marking the biggest visual shift since iOS 7
abandoned skeuomorphism. While Liquid Glass reshapes icons across
macOS and iOS, designers are particularly frustrated by the simplified
Font Book icon, which now shows a single sans-serif “a” instead of
multiple typefaces, making the app's purpose feel less clear. Critics
say the change hurts usability and removes personality, while
supporters argue it's cleaner and fits the new aesthetic. Overall, the
update reflects Apple's ongoing move toward a sleeker but less playful
visual style, distancing itself from the more characterful designs of
the 2000s.

 THE UX SKILLS GAP AND WHY EMPLOYERS NEED DESIGN THINKERS, NOT JUST
DEVELOPERS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UK organisations face a critical UX skills gap, with teams rich in
technical talent but lacking professionals who can connect digital
systems to actual user needs through design thinking. The Design
Council reports that firms that integrate design into business
processes grow twice as fast, yet many digital transformation projects
fail due to poor user experience rather than technical shortcomings.
Apprenticeships in UX and digital design offer employers a practical
solution for developing design thinkers internally, building a
workforce capable of combining analytical skills with human-centered
problem-solving. 

 HOW TO REWILD YOUR CREATIVE PRACTICE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A writer and artist who relocated from NYC to Upstate New York
discovered that gardening transformed her creative approach and helped
combat digital burnout. Through years of cultivating her yard, she
learned six transferable lessons: embrace creative ecosystems through
collaboration, start projects with available resources, ruthlessly
edit ideas like pruning plants, experiment abundantly without knowing
the outcomes, accept slow, nonlinear progress, and celebrate completed
work. The practice of working with soil, plants, and natural cycles
rewired her into a happier person while grounding her predominantly
digital creative life.

 THIS THING IS KILLING YOUR CREATIVE MOMENTUM (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Designers often scatter their creative energy across multiple complex
problems in a single day, believing this multitasking reflects
productivity, but each creative challenge demands its own distinct
mental space. The most effective creative work happens when someone
commits to solving one substantial problem per day, allowing their
mind to fully enter that world and make meaningful progress rather
than hovering superficially across several tasks. This isn't about
doing less work overall—smaller tasks and refinements can still
happen—but about recognizing that quality creative output requires
choosing which single problem deserves full attention today. 

 MENTIMETER INTRODUCES PLAYFUL NEW ILLUSTRATION SYSTEM BY LOEK VUGS AS
PART OF ITS GLOBAL REBRAND (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mentimeter's rebrand adds a new hand-drawn illustration and animation
system by Dutch designer Loek Vugs, blending the platform's clean UI
with lively, sketchbook-style visuals. Built through broad early
sketch exploration, the single-colour drawings balance minimalism with
realistic human movement and span both expressive spot illustrations
and a clear icon set—producing memorable concepts like the
half-horse “error” costume. Designed with motion in mind, the
artwork animates with simple, satisfying loops that enhance small UI
interactions, giving Mentimeter a more playful and distinctive
personality as the update rolls out. 

 NEW REPORT SHOWS DESIGN AGENCIES' INCOME UP BUT PROFITS FLAT (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new report shows UK design and branding agencies stabilizing after
a difficult period, with fee income rising 5.5% (3% after inflation)
and strong growth in retail, packaging, and brand identity work.
However, profitability remains weak: margins are flat at 6.9%,
employment costs keep climbing, and both income and profit per head
have fallen. Group-owned agencies now outperform independents. The
report warns that AI is pressuring fees while demanding new
investment, pushing agencies to shift gradually toward value-based
pricing to stay competitive.
