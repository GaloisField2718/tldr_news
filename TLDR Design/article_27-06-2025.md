 CREATIVE COMMONS DEBUTS CC SIGNALS, A FRAMEWORK FOR AN OPEN AI
ECOSYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Creative Commons' CC Signals is a new framework that allows dataset
holders to specify how their content can be used for AI training. It
aims to balance internet openness with growing AI data demands. The
project addresses concerns that continued data extraction could prompt
websites to implement paywalls or access restrictions to protect their
content. CC signals will offer legally enforceable tools with ethical
weight, similar to existing CC licenses. An alpha launch is planned
for November. 

 BRING A CONSISTENT LOOK AND FEEL TO YOUR FIGMA MAKE PROTOTYPES AND
WEB APPS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma Make now allows users to import styling context from published
libraries, enabling the extraction of color palettes, typography with
custom fonts, and core styling elements. Users can also establish
manual guidelines through a guideline.md file to direct how the model
creates their Makes. This feature bridges existing design systems with
Make's creation process, ensuring consistency across generated
content. 

 GOOGLE REDESIGNED THE PHONE APP WITH THE MATERIAL 3 EXPRESSIVE STYLE
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has redesigned its Phone app with a cleaner, more expressive
Material 3 look, simplifying navigation to just three tabs: Home,
Keyboard, and Voicemail. Visual updates include larger buttons,
smoother shapes, and a new gesture-based system for answering calls. A
full rollout is expected in September.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHEN AI HAS BETTER TASTE THAN YOU (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI is rapidly surpassing human capabilities across domains, from
physical to analytical to creative skills, challenging the belief that
taste remains humanity's unique advantage. While great taste involves
pattern recognition that AI could replicate, the highest form of taste
requires cultural courage to champion unfamiliar work and shape new
movements. Human agency, the will to act on values and direct AI
toward meaningful purposes, is the most distinctly human moat in an
age of commoditized capabilities. 

 THE BROKEN RHETORIC OF AI (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The current discourse around AI in design is dominated by fear,
status anxiety, and performative noise, turning what could be a moment
of shared learning into a toxic race for attention, dominance, and
validation. Instead, we need to shift toward healthier conversations
grounded in curiosity, nuance, humility, and community — ones that
invite reflection, experimentation, and collective growth rather than
exclusion and anxiety. 

 IS THIS THE TWILIGHT OF THE SMARTPHONE? (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The dominance of the smartphone, largely unchanged since the first
iPhone in 2007, is being challenged by AI-driven concepts from tech
leaders like Jony Ive and OpenAI, aiming to create more intuitive,
screenless, and ambient computing experiences. While some believe we
may soon shift to new AI-powered devices like smart glasses or
wearables, widespread adoption faces hurdles such as public distrust,
privacy concerns, and the lack of a unifying cultural shift,
suggesting we may be entering a fragmented tech era rather than a
single, revolutionary replacement.

 STORY-BASED SOCIAL POSTS: DESIGNING NARRATIVES FOR SWIPEABLE CONTENT
(5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Story-based swipeable content transforms social media engagement by
breaking information into digestible, sequential frames that guide
users through structured narratives. These multi-image formats, such
as Instagram carousels and LinkedIn document posts, achieve
significantly higher engagement rates than single posts by tapping
into our natural storytelling instincts. Compelling swipeable stories
follow a five-part structure supported by consistent visual design and
precise pacing: hook, context, main content, climax, and
call-to-action. 

 A UX REVIEW OF PEUGEOT'S NEW INTERIOR: WHEN DESIGN AMBITION MEETS

bold dashboard redesign with a beautiful display. However, after a
week of use, it became clear that the software couldn't match the
impressive hardware.
