NEWS & TRENDS

 APPLE TESTING NEW ‘DEEP RED' COLOR FOR IPHONE 18 PRO, NO ‘FUN
COLORS' FOR IPHONE FOLD (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Rumors suggest Apple is testing a new deep red color for the iPhone
18 Pro, potentially giving users the first red “Pro” model, though
it's unclear whether it will replace or join the popular Cosmic Orange
option. Meanwhile, the upcoming iPhone Fold is expected to launch in
more conservative colors like black or silver, likely to simplify
manufacturing for Apple's first foldable device. 

 A NEW WAY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF: GEMINI CAN NOW CREATE MUSIC (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Google has launched Lyria 3, its most advanced music generation
model, in the Gemini app in beta, letting users create 30-second
tracks from text or image prompts. The model generates lyrics
automatically, offers control over style, vocals, and tempo, and
produces more musically complex results than previous Lyria versions.
Available to users 18+ in eight languages, all generated tracks are
watermarked with SynthID to identify them as AI-created content. 

 REDDIT COLOR CHANGES GO LIVE WITH OPT-OUT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Reddit is rolling out community color theming, which lets each
subreddit choose an accent color that appears across buttons, links,
and headers to create stronger visual identity. It's enabled by
default but can be turned off globally in settings. The update aims to
improve recognition and navigation without the complexity of old
custom skins, though some users have raised accessibility and contrast
concerns and mixed reactions to the sudden color changes.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HORROR MOVIE POSTER DESIGN HAS A PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Horror movie posters have increasingly fallen into a repetitive
black-and-red minimalist formula—featuring eerie imagery and bold
sans-serif titles—that once felt striking but now feels
oversaturated and uninspired. Although the color scheme remains
psychologically effective at evoking fear, the genre's history of
inventive, diverse designs shows there's plenty of room for more
creative and risk-taking approaches. 

 DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR FUTURE AI (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Carnegie Mellon product design team developed 17 principles for AI
design over the next five years to address four core tensions between
AI capability and human agency. As AI shifts from reactive tools to
persistent, ambient systems, the central challenge moves from
technical performance to preserving cognitive sovereignty, meaningful
creativity, and institutional accountability. The principles call for
designs that keep humans as intentional participants rather than
passive consumers of automated outputs. 

 THIS IS FIGMA'S "MAKE" OR BREAK MOMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figma's Make tool offers a fast path to interactive prototypes by
leveraging existing design context, components, and collaboration
surfaces teams already use. Its biggest constraints — one-way GitHub
export, enforced AI credit limits coming in March, and generic code
quality — keep it firmly in the prototyping phase rather than
production. With competitors like Lovable, v0, and Cursor operating
closer to real engineering pipelines, Make's most likely fate is
becoming a solid interactive prototyping layer, not a full software
creation tool.

 AGENTIC UX: 7 PRINCIPLES FOR DESIGNING SYSTEMS WITH AGENTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 As products adopt agentic AI—systems that plan, use tools, and act
toward goals—designers must move beyond interface polish to
structure the underlying systems, data, and workflows that enable
agents to work reliably and transparently. Effective Agentic UX
focuses on strong foundations, invisible and contextual automation,
proactive but non-intrusive assistance, familiar UI patterns,
well-timed data collection, and clear human control, ensuring agents
accelerate work without eroding trust or disrupting flow. 

 CONSISTENCY IS PRIMITIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI-enabled instant software creation eliminates the economic need for
standardization, making bespoke software as viable as uniform
products. Design and consistency, long treated as marks of
technological maturity, are reframed as constraints imposed by
manufacturing costs. This shift raises unresolved questions about
knowledge-sharing, agency, and human identity in a world where
artifacts are generated rather than made. 

 THE LATEST DESIGN PROBLEM? GETTING A JOB (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Despite widespread layoffs and a brutal job market, demand for
designers is actually rising, especially at high-growth companies that
treat design as a competitive edge. The skills now being screened for
are product sensibility, the ability to prototype mid-conversation,
impeccable craft, and AI fluency. Paradoxically, AI making execution
trivially cheap has made taste and judgment scarcer, turning this into
a strong moment for designers who can make things matter.
