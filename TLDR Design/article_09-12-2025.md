NEWS & TRENDS

 THE NEW CNBC LOGO IS ALREADY CONTROVERSIAL (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CNBC is set to retire its iconic peacock logo in favor of a
minimalist wordmark with a fused N and B and a blue upward arrow,
reflecting the network's financial focus and design language. The
redesign, launching December 15, has sparked criticism for appearing
disjointed, personality-free, and confusing. It has been compared to
controversial rebrands like Cracker Barrel and the GAP logo,
highlighting the risks of extreme minimalism in logo design. 

 ADOBE AND AMAZON FORGE DEEPER AI PARTNERSHIP TO TRANSFORM CREATIVITY
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe and Amazon are deepening their partnership. AWS infrastructure
will be used to power AI features across Adobe Express, Acrobat
Studio, and Firefly. The collaboration extends to marketing through
Adobe Experience Platform on AWS and GenStudio integration with Amazon
Ads, enabling faster campaign launches and real-time customer
personalization. Both companies are also developing autonomous AI
agents through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to manage content creation and
marketing workflows independently. 

 AI FINDS ITS WAY INTO APPLE'S TOP APPS OF THE YEAR (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Apple has announced its 2025 App Store Award winners. Visual AI
planner Tiimo was named iPhone app of the year, and Pokémon TCG
Pocket won iPhone game of the year. While Apple avoided naming a
dedicated AI app or chatbot as the top winner, AI features were
prominent across several honorees, including iPad app Detail's
auto-editing and Apple Watch app Strava's workout insights. The 17
winners span iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and
Apple Arcade categories, plus Cultural Impact awards for apps that
promote inclusivity and offer helpful tools.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 HOW TO REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD IN UX (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reducing cognitive load in UX isn't about oversimplifying complex
interfaces. Expert software must match real-world complexity to be
effective. Designers should break tasks into smaller steps, avoid
forcing users to remember information across screens, and support
decision-making through chunking options and clear labeling. The key
is understanding how users actually work with a product rather than
judging interfaces by appearance alone. 

 DESIGN TOKENS GOVERNANCE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design tokens require careful governance since designer-led
approaches preserve brand intent but may miss technical constraints,
while developer-led approaches optimize for performance but can lose
design meaning. The biggest challenge is keeping design tools and code
in sync, mainly when emergency fixes, platform-specific adjustments,
or technical constraints create a gap between what designers envision
and what ships in production. A bidirectional sync strategy using
CI/CD pipelines, drift detection, change classification, and regular
audits can help mature teams maintain consistency while letting each
side work in their preferred tools. 

 WHY YOU NEED DESIGN MATURITY IN A PRODUCT ORGANISATION, AND HOW TO
GET IT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design maturity is key for high-performing product organizations,
enabling them to navigate uncertainty and create future value rather
than just manage usability. Narrowly focused design limits creativity
and strategic impact, while mature design surfaces opportunities,
translates insights into experiences, and complements product
management, engineering, and other disciplines. By involving design
early and strategically, teams can explore multiple futures, iterate
effectively, and operate as adaptive, innovative systems capable of
shaping what comes next.

 USABILITY TESTING PROCESS EXPLAINED IN COMIC STRIPS (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Jakob Nielsen created three comic strips using Nano Banana Pro to
illustrate his systematic 12-step usability testing process, applying
it to different product types: a plant care app, a grocery e-commerce
site, and a toaster. Each strip uses a distinct visual style—from
the default comic style to a realistic digital airbrush approach with
character sheets, to a children's comic featuring animal characters.
Nielsen recommends following all 12 steps for teams new to user
research, though experienced teams may shorten some steps depending on
their project. 

 PUBLIC DESIGN SYSTEMS ARE WORTH IT (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Public design systems serve as a "marketplace of ideas" that benefits
the entire community, with each shared system raising the bar and
helping others learn. Closing these systems is shortsighted, as public
visibility acts as a quality forcing function, aids recruiting, boosts
team morale, and trains future designers. Despite the challenges of
maintaining public systems, the trend toward privatization threatens a
valuable shared resource that the design systems community has taken
for granted. 

 THINGS I REPEAT OFTEN ENOUGH ABOUT SURVEYS THAT IT WAS TIME TO WRITE
THEM DOWN (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Well-designed surveys are powerful research tools when done
thoughtfully, but they require practice and attention to the
respondent's experience. Avoid asking for information you already
have, unnecessary or required questions, ambiguous phrasing, lengthy
or matrix-style questions, and predictions about future behavior.
Always explain the survey's purpose, write clearly and
conversationally, provide inclusive and edge-case answer choices, and
include a catch-all question for additional insights. Surveys work
best to signal trends, recruit people for deeper research, and foster
team collaboration, rather than as a replacement for direct user
engagement.
