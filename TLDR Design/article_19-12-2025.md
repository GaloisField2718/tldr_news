 APPLE'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY IPHONE MAY FEATURE A BOLD DESIGN YOU'LL
EITHER LOVE OR HATE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple has reportedly planned a special-edition iPhone for fall 2027
to mark the device's 20th anniversary. Featuring a curved display that
wraps around the front and back edges while eliminating the
traditional black frame, the design would resemble curved-display
Android phones from Samsung, Motorola, and Xiaomi. Such displays have
faced criticism for accidental touches, durability concerns, and
issues with screen protector compatibility. With two years until
release, Apple has time to address these common problems associated
with curved-display smartphones. 

 ADOBE FIREFLY NOW SUPPORTS PROMPT-BASED VIDEO EDITING, ADDS MORE
THIRD-PARTY MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe's Firefly AI video app now features prompt-based video editing,
allowing users to modify specific elements like colors and camera
angles without regenerating entire clips. The update includes
integrating third-party models, such as Black Forest Labs' FLUX.2 for
image upscaling and Topaz Astra for video upscaling to 4K. Adobe is
offering unlimited generations to premium subscribers through January
15 as competition intensifies in AI-generated video. 

 OLED IMAC IN THE WORKS, SAYS REPORT – WITH TWO CATCHES (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple is reportedly exploring an OLED iMac for the first time.
Early-stage discussions are underway with Samsung and LG about a
24-inch OLED panel that will offer 600 nits brightness and the same
resolution as today's model. However, the project is at a very
preliminary RFI stage, meaning an OLED iMac likely wouldn't launch
until 2027–2028 or later, and Apple's preferred OLED technology
currently can't support larger 30–32-inch iMac displays.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BRETT WESTERVELT ON WHY CRAFT, COLLABORATION AND THE PAST FUEL THE
FUTURE OF CREATIVITY (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Instagram's role as a creative platform requires the design team
itself to embody creativity through collaboration, diverse
perspectives, and meticulous craft. Unlocking creativity demands both
excellent tools and an audience to share with. The team draws
inspiration from past design principles, like Charles Eames' "innovate
as a last resort," applying this philosophy to products like the Edits
app, which simplifies video editing based on creator feedback rather
than pursuing novelty for its own sake. 

 STOP ASKING USERS WHAT THEY WANT — AND START WATCHING WHAT THEY DO
(7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Product teams often rely on user opinions from surveys and
interviews, but research shows that people's stated preferences rarely
align with their actual behavior due to cognitive biases and limited
self-awareness. Opinion-driven development leads to fragmented
experiences, wasted resources, and reactive roadmaps filled with minor
tweaks rather than meaningful solutions. Instead, teams should observe
real user behavior through analytics and usability testing, treat
feature requests as signals of problems requiring deeper
investigation, and anchor decisions in measurable outcomes. 

 WHY 2025'S BEST REBRANDS MOSTLY HAPPENED WHILE WE WEREN'T LOOKING (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The most impactful rebrands of 2025 weren't the loud, controversial
ones like Cracker Barrel, Jaguar, or HBO Max, but quiet, strategic
evolutions by brands such as Amazon, Walmart, Apple TV, Eventbrite,
and La-Z-Boy that refined clarity, coherence, and long-term brand
systems. The key lesson is that effective rebranding now favors
evolution over shock, systems over spectacle, and listening to
audiences over imposing radical change.

 I USED NANO BANANA PRO TO CREATE 20 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS, THE RESPONSE
THEY GOT WAS SHOCKING (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A journalist tested Google's Nano Banana Pro image generator by
creating over 20 social media graphics, resulting in a 57% increase in
LinkedIn impressions. The tool produced professional-looking explainer
graphics, inspirational posters, and controversial images within
seconds, though it frequently hallucinated information. While the
AI-generated images boosted engagement and looked polished, they
lacked personality and an authentic human touch, with attempts to
create viral content falling flat despite the tool's technical
competence. 

 LOWER THE SURPRISE: APPLYING THE FREE ENERGY PRINCIPLE TO UX (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Free Energy Principle describes how the brain aims to minimize
the mismatch between expectations and sensory input. It helps explain
why design principles like feedback, Gestalt grouping, and clear
states feel intuitive while broken interactions cause stress and
frustration. By using abductive reasoning—forming hypotheses about
user expectations and emotional context—designers can go beyond
rules and create solutions that better align perception with
expectation and reduce user uncertainty. 

 FRONTIFY PRESENTS: HOW GRETEL AND PHILADELPHIA ART MUSEUM NAVIGATED
CHANGE (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Gretel partnered with the Philadelphia Museum of Art on a bold
rebrand aimed at making the institution feel more open, local, and
welcoming while preserving its authority, grounding the work deeply in
Philadelphia's culture, history, and vernacular. Through close
collaboration, they evolved the museum's name, redrew the historic
griffin, created a custom typeface, and built a flexible brand system
that balances heritage with accessibility and contemporary relevance.
