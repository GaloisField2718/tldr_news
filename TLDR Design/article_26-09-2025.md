NEWS & TRENDS

 NVIDIA'S POWERFUL AI FACIAL ANIMATION TOOL IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR ALL
(3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nvidia open-sourced its Audio2Face AI tool, making realistic facial
animation technology freely available to all developers. The tool
analyzes audio features, such as phonemes and intonation, to
automatically generate lip-sync and emotional expressions for digital
characters. Audio2Face now includes plugins for Maya and Unreal Engine
5, as well as a training framework for customizing models. 

 INSTAGRAM'S NEW LAYOUT PRIORITIZES REELS AND DMS: WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN
YOUR NAVIGATION BAR (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Instagram is removing the post button from its bottom navigation bar
and replacing it with a dedicated DMs button, alongside home, Reels,
search, and profile tabs. The redesign stems from Instagram reaching
three billion users, with growth primarily driven by DMs, Reels, and
recommendations, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri. Users will
still be able to post content by accessing the posting feature from
the top-left corner of the app instead. 

 SUZUKI'S NEW LOGO IS A MODERN TRIUMPH (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Suzuki has unveiled its first logo redesign in 22 years, shifting
from its glossy chrome look to a cleaner, more minimalist style suited
for the digital age. The updated logo keeps its iconic "S" but now
features a matte silver gradient with simplified ridges for better
legibility, aligns with sustainability by using silver paint instead
of chrome, and comes with a new tagline, "By Your Side."

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE FIVE HABITS OF THE BEST DESIGNERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The best designers aren't necessarily the most talented, but rather
those most effective at implementing good ideas in the real world.
Five key habits distinguish them: maintaining open minds that embrace
curiosity over perfectionism, staying grounded in current workplace
realities rather than fantasizing about ideal companies, practicing
pragmatic idealism by breaking grand visions into actionable steps,
reframing difficult problems using design thinking to help business
leaders, and showing patience when educating colleagues about design
processes. These traits enable designers to have a greater positive
impact than those who rely solely on raw creative talent. 

 DESIGN CONTEXT, EVERYWHERE YOU BUILD (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma has announced updates to its MCP server and Code Connect, which
bring design context to any development environment, including IDEs,
AI agents, and prototypes. The MCP server now supports remote access
and works with Figma Make files, while Code Connect introduces in-app
component mapping to align design and code components more easily.
These tools help teams move from design ideas to production code more
quickly by making the design system context portable across different
workflows. 

 WHY DESIGN SYSTEM NAMING FEELS IMPOSSIBLE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Naming in design systems isn't just semantics — it's a hidden
source of friction, mistrust, and wasted time that scales into major
adoption problems. Common traps like premature precision, visual-based
labels, abbreviations, and outdated names create cognitive overload,
while sustainable systems require function-first naming, clear
taxonomies, quarterly audits, and documented rationale to keep names
accurate, consistent, and trustworthy as teams and products evolve.

 AI IN UX DESIGN: HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS SHAPING USER
EXPERIENCES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI is transforming UX design by enabling personalization at scale,
accelerating user research through data analysis, and automating rapid
prototyping and testing. The technology enhances accessibility
features, such as voice recognition and screen readers, while reducing
repetitive tasks, allowing designers to focus on creativity and
strategy. Rather than replacing human designers, AI serves as a
partner that amplifies their capabilities to create more innovative,
data-driven user experiences. 

 HOW TO TURN PUBLIC FEEDBACK INTO BETTER UX (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Public feedback from X, Reddit, reviews, and other platforms provides
more honest UX insights than traditional surveys, as users share
unfiltered frustrations in real-world contexts. Teams should
systematically collect and categorize this feedback, focusing on
emotional language and recurring complaints to identify genuine
usability problems rather than isolated issues. By turning these
complaints into quick design experiments and testing fixes with the
original complainers, companies can improve their products faster than
relying solely on formal research methods. 

 EIGA'S BRAND SYSTEM LETS KATHOLINO KINDERGARTENS SHAPE THEIR OWN
IDENTITY (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 EIGA developed a flexible brand system for Katholino kindergartens
built around a cross-shaped heart logo, offering over 500 variations
so each facility can express its individuality while staying within a
shared framework. Supported by a custom child-friendly typeface,
seasonal colour palette, and easy-to-use templates, the system
empowers non-designers to create consistent, practical, and expressive
communication while reinforcing the community's core value of
“shaping childhood together.”
