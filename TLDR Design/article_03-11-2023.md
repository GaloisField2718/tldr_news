 DESIGNING BETTER REVIEWS AND RATINGS UX (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 95% of users turn to reviews for information about how well a product
meets their needs. Sadly, reviewing and rating UX often confuses and
frustrates users instead of helping them. To improve these vital
elements, you can display decimal ratings and total number of reviews,
display a breakdown of the rating distribution summary by product
attributes, allow users to mark helpful reviews, and even reward users
for negative reviews. 

 TIPS FROM A MARKETING EXPERT ON HOW TO SELL YOURSELF AS A GRAPHIC
DESIGNER (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 You need to be more than just a great designer in 2023. You also have
to be able to sell yourself, keep up to date with social media,
maintain your website, be your IT, be your HR department, network like
crazy, and somehow find time to eat and sleep. Start by defining your
target audience and what you are offering them. Forget the number of
followers on social media and connect with creatives in real life,
treat yourself like a client, and use AI as a tool, especially for the
parts you aren‚Äôt confident about. 

 USER RESEARCH OFTEN TAKES TIME. HOW DO YOU MAKE IT WORK IN STARTUPS?
(9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 As a UX designer or researcher at a startup, it can feel like the
team is sprinting down a path as fast as possible. You don‚Äôt get
weeks to get user research done, you only get days. Instead of
detailed spreadsheets with UX research data, designers should focus on
getting the main message across, use the rainbow spreadsheet to make
user research visible with color, and do the page-level notetaking
with sticky notes to highlight problematic areas.

 WALT DISNEY STUDIOS‚Äô DRAWING ON THE PAST (WEBSITE) [13] 

 Investors are starting to worry Walt Disney Studios is beginning to
show its age as it turns 100. Its share price dropped to its lowest
level in nearly nine years as the company stumbled in streaming. But
adapting to the times is not a new challenge for Disney. Instead,
it‚Äôs been a point of survival throughout the company‚Äôs history. A
century ago when ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù was a single person and not a global
company worth over $150 billion, emerging sound and color technologies
rattled the silent film industry.

 DISASTERS "VERY RARELY NOT A DESIGN FAILURE" SAYS EXPERT LUCY
EASTHOPE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Leading disaster expert Lucy Easthope explains why she gets chills
when architects work on disaster recovery pro bono. "What natural
disasters have done over the years is simply cloak massive design
failings," Easthope says. Architects working on projects subject to
flooding or wildfires must maintain a mental balance that involves
imagining, exciting, and innovatively pushing the boundaries of
failure while simultaneously preparing for the worst.
