OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 A CASE FOR SLOW GROWTH (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fast growth can look impressive, but it often lacks the strength and
depth that come from time and repetition. Real expertise is built by
consistently engaging with challenging problems, learning from each
experience, and developing sound judgment through practice. True
growth isn't about racing ahead - it's about steady, intentional
progress that leads to lasting capability and confidence. 

 TOOLS DON'T DESIGN, PEOPLE DO (YES, THIS IS A LITTLE ABOUT AI) (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The fundamental skills needed for interaction design remain unchanged
despite the rise of AI tools. Skills should be defined independently
of specific tools, focusing instead on behaviors and outcomes. While
AI can enhance these skills, it lacks discernment, a critical quality
for assessing context and appropriateness in design. 

 SKILLS ARE THE NEW CURRENCY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Foundational human skills like discernment and creativity are
becoming valuable as technology advances. The debates around consent
and ownership in generative AI signify a shift where value lies in
both production and individual approaches. The focus is shifting from
what we create to how we create it, prompting us to consider the
implications of our craft in a digital landscape.

 DESIGNSHIFT: FROM MINDSET TO ACCESS (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The "Mindset Myth" claims success comes solely from personal drive,
overlooking systemic barriers and unequal access to resources. Design
often targets individual problems instead of deeper issues like
poverty and inequality. Refocusing on access by recognizing exclusion,
using a systems lens, and centering marginalized groups can lead to
more just and effective solutions.
