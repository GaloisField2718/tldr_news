MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design communication must go beyond user stories and focus on value

organization. 

 HOW LONG SHOULD A DESIGN SYSTEM TAKE? (7 MINUTE READ) [10]

requiring ongoing iteration and adaptation to maintain stability. By
setting realistic expectations, thinking in milestones, and creating a
roadmap, design teams can better manage these projects and provide the
