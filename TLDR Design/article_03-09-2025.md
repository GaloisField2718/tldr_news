 INSTAGRAM TESTS PICTURE-IN-PICTURE VIEWING FOR REELS (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Instagram has begun testing a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature for
Reels that allows users to continue watching videos in a floating
window while using other apps, potentially improving engagement and
multitasking. The test follows earlier hints from Instagram head Adam
Mosseri and aligns Instagram with competitors like TikTok and YouTube,
which already offer similar functionality. While currently limited to
a small user group, the feature could help creators retain viewers for
longer content and increase overall time spent on the platform. 

 THE DREADED MINIMALIST LOGO TREND CLAIMS ANOTHER FASHION VICTIM (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 & Other Stories has unveiled a new logo, replacing its chic,
script-style wordmark with a minimalist serif design that many feel
strips away the brand's personality. While the update improves
legibility, critics argue it embodies a wider trend of generic,
characterless rebrands that leave once-distinctive identities feeling
flat. 

 KUO REITERATES TOUCH ID IN THE IPHONE FOLD; UNLIKELY TO BE IN-DISPLAY
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's first foldable iPhone, expected in 2026 at around $2,000,
will likely feature Touch ID on the side button instead of Face ID due
to thickness and cost constraints. An under-display sensor is
unlikely. The device will have a 5.5-inch outer screen, a 7.8-inch
inner display, a minimal crease, and multiple cameras.

 BEYOND THE HYPE: WHAT AI CAN REALLY DO FOR PRODUCT DESIGN (14 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI tools show promise in product design but require strategic
integration rather than wholesale replacement. It can enhance four key
stages: idea generation through RAG systems that pull relevant context
from focused documents, rapid prototyping for individual UI elements
and micro-animations, visual experimentation as a creative sparring
partner despite styling limitations, and large-scale data analysis
that enables designers to process thousands of user responses
efficiently. Rather than serving as an autopilot, AI functions best as
a co-pilot that accelerates exploration, validates concepts, and
handles repetitive tasks, allowing designers to focus on strategic
thinking and creative problem-solving. 

 DESIGNING FOR EPHEMERALITY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Software inevitably dies despite builders' pride in creating
seemingly eternal products. Designing for ephemerality means building
with grace: ensuring data portability, leaving documentation
artifacts, and treating longevity as a bonus rather than a guarantee.
This approach shifts focus from chasing immortality to creating
meaningful impact, embracing impermanence as a design principle that
adds weight rather than diminishes value. 

 FROM PLAYTIME TO PRACTICE: DESIGNING AI WITH THE PROMPT COACH (10
MINUTE READ) [9]

developing practical frameworks for prompting and even creating a
witty “Prompt Coach” in Gemini to help colleagues improve their
skills. By blending design thinking with AI, they've turned prompting
into a teachable craft, showing that AI can complement and scale their
work rather than replace it.

 HOW CODING CAN IMPROVE DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Learning frontend development fundamentally changed this designer's

tokens, and semantic HTML improved their ability to create scalable
systems, design with accessibility in mind, and collaborate more
effectively with developers through shared technical language. While
the designer is not pursuing full-time development, the coding
experience enhanced design practice by fostering empathy, curiosity,
and cross-functional partnership skills.
