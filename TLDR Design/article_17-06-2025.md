NEWS & TRENDS

 INTRODUCING DESIGN MODE ON V0 (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 V0, a generative AI tool by Vercel that turns natural language
prompts into user interface (UI) components or even entire web pages,
now has a “Design Mode” that lets designers instantly adjust copy,
typography, layout, colors, and styling without using credits or
waiting for an LLM. It supports live previews, easy saving, and is
fully native to Tailwind and shadcn. 

 GOOGLE JUST RELEASED THE FIRST MAJOR SNAPSEED UPDATE IN YEARS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google released Snapseed 3.0 for iPhone and iPad, marking the photo
editing app's first major iOS update since 2021. The revamped
interface features a new "Faves" option in the center toolbar for
saving specific tools, plus relocated export and tools buttons.
Android users must wait as Google hasn't announced when the update
will arrive on that platform. 

 SNAPCHAT ADDS NEW FEATURES FOR CREATORS, INCLUDING AN EASIER WAY TO
EDIT VIDEOS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Snapchat has launched new creator tools, including a Timeline Editor
for intuitive video editing and a "Create a Video" template that
generates compilations from saved Memories. The platform now allows
creators to auto-save public Stories to profiles and provides enhanced
analytics showing viewer retention, traffic sources, and engagement
metrics. These features aim to help Snapchat compete with Instagram
and TikTok by reducing creators' reliance on third-party editing apps.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOU CAN HATE IOS 26 AND LIQUID GLASS BUT THE STEVE JOBS NOSTALGIA
NEEDS TO STOP (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 While iOS 26's new Liquid Glass UI has divided opinion and sparked
nostalgia-fueled claims that Steve Jobs would have hated it, the truth
is likely the opposite—Jobs, a fan of skeuomorphism, unification,
and control, would probably have embraced its tactile realism and
cohesive integration of AI. Rather than resisting Apple's current
direction, Jobs would have doubled down on simplifying the ecosystem
and leveraging design to shape user experience, just as Liquid Glass
aims to do. 

 AGENT MANAGEMENT INTERFACE PATTERNS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There's an emergence of interface design patterns for managing AI
agents that can enhance familiar UI elements like Kanban boards,
dashboards, inboxes, task lists, and calendars, which could help users
start, monitor, and control multiple agents. Each pattern offers
different advantages and limitations for agent management, from
Kanban's workflow visualization to the calendar's temporal
organization capabilities. These patterns will evolve significantly as
agent management interfaces mature, potentially drawing inspiration
from real-time strategy game interfaces rather than traditional
productivity tools. 

 REIMAGINING DESIGN SYSTEMS AS EVOLVING PRODUCTS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design systems should be treated as evolving products rather than
static libraries, requiring continuous research, design, testing, and
refinement cycles. All team members, not just dedicated design system
teams, must share responsibility for the system's evolution and must
balance business needs with customer requirements. Sandbox testing is
key, as it validates new components through controlled experimentation
before full implementation.
