 THE KERNING ON THE POPE'S TOMB IS A TRAVESTY (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pope Francis, known for his empathetic and progressive leadership,
was recently laid to rest in a simple tomb bearing only his name and a
cross. The tomb has faced criticism for poor kerning, with experts

an amateur using Times New Roman. While the flaw does not diminish his
legacy, some say it fittingly reflects his humility in a sincere but
imperfect tribute.
