OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LOSING IS PART OF BEING A DESIGNER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Just as it is in sports, losing is integral to a designer's journey.
Facing rejection and criticism, like losing a tennis match, reduces
pressure and can enhance performance. It is essential to embrace
disagreement from stakeholders and teammates, focus on the process
rather than the outcome, and anticipate common objections. Accepting
these challenges helps improve your design skills and resilience. 

 HOW WILL AI AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCT DESIGNERS? (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI will impact product designers by enabling them to produce more
work and allowing non-designers to take over some design tasks. If
designers become too efficient, this could lead to job reductions.
Roles like product managers may increasingly handle design tasks.
Adapting by expanding skills beyond design will help maintain demand
for designers. 

 THE ROI OF A DESIGN SYSTEM TEAM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Evaluating the ROI of a design system team involves considering both
the time saved and the value created. However, the team's initial cost
can be a significant hurdle. To break even, a design system team must
focus on building components that save more time for the organization
than their development cost.

 THE PROS AND CONS OF EXPERIENCE: DOES IT HELP OR HINDER YOU? (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 While experience can provide valuable insights and problem-solving
skills, it can lead to apathy, inflexible thinking, and
overcomplication. Hiring someone with potential but less experience
can bring fresh perspectives. Experienced individuals need to remain
adaptable and self-aware. Enthusiasm and commitment can often outweigh
years of experience in achieving success.
