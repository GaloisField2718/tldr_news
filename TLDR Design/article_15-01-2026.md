 GOOGLE'S UPDATED VEO MODEL CAN MAKE VERTICAL VIDEOS FROM REFERENCE
IMAGES WITH 4K UPSCALING (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's updated Veo model, version 3.1, introduces "Ingredients to
Video," which allows users to create vertical videos from reference
images with enhanced fidelity. The update supports higher resolutions,
including 4K upscaling, while maintaining ease of use for short video

 YOUTUBE NOW HAS A WAY FOR PARENTS TO BLOCK KIDS FROM WATCHING SHORTS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube is expanding parental controls to help limit how much time
kids and teens spend watching Shorts. Parents can now set time limits,
block Shorts entirely either temporarily or permanently, and add
custom Bedtime and Take a Break reminders. The update also makes it
easier to switch between parent and child accounts and builds on
existing teen supervision tools and age estimation features.

 WHAT I'M SEEING FOR UX AS WE MOVE INTO 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As UX faces challenges in 2026, a divide emerges between
template-driven, AI-capable work and human-centered design requiring
soft skills. The shift toward meaningful AI implementation allows UX
professionals to demonstrate their value through understanding user
needs. Success in this evolving landscape hinges on embracing
complexity, broadening skill sets, and proactively shaping AI's role
in UX. 

 NO FEAR'S NEW LOGO PROVES BRANDS ARE TERRIFIED TO STAND OUT (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 No Fear, once a defining brand of '90s and Y2K youth culture with
edgy graphics and rebellious attitude, faded as trends changed and Gen
Z moved on. It has now returned as NO FEAR SPORT, a minimalist, Gen
Z–friendly version with neutral colors, clean layouts, and subtle
logos, which may be more modern and marketable but loses much of the
chaotic, bold spirit that made the original brand iconic and
nostalgically loved. 

 WHY JANUARY IS A TERRIBLE TIME TO MAKE BIG CAREER DECISIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 January is a terrible time to make big creative decisions because
people are mentally drained from the holidays, low on energy, often
short on money, and pressured by “new year, new you” culture.
Winter is naturally a season for rest, yet social media and FOMO push
rushed pivots that are often regretted. A better approach is to use
January for reflection and admin, February for light planning, and
wait until spring—when clarity and energy return—to make major
creative moves.

 DESIGN AFTER THE PROMPT: WHY ADOBE'S AI STRATEGY MATTERS MORE THAN
MIDJOURNEY & CO. (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Adobe's AI strategy, which emphasizes “Design After the Prompt,”
transforms creative processes from chaotic prompting to systematic
orchestration, enhancing brand integrity. This shift moves
professionals toward refined tools and collaborative workflows,
fostering precise creative direction. Robust content verification
through the Content Authenticity Initiative ensures transparency,
distinguishing Adobe in the evolving landscape of digital media. 

 DESIGNING FOR DOPAMINE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Digital products use psychological triggers like reward loops,
anticipation, and variable rewards—through tools such as infinite
scroll, notifications, gamification, and social proof—to keep users
engaged by stimulating the brain's reward system. While these
techniques can make experiences compelling, overuse can lead to
manipulation, burnout, and compulsive behavior, so designers are urged
to use them responsibly by limiting nudges, prioritizing user
well-being, being transparent, and designing for balance rather than
dependence. 

 RECENT™ BUILDS A COFFEE BRAND AROUND CALM ENERGY AND FORWARD MOTION
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Flow is a café brand designed to balance speciality coffee precision
with relaxed all-day brunch, expressed through an identity built
around calm energy and continuous movement. Created by Recent™, it
uses a custom looping wordmark, a multi-meaning symbol, a restrained
grey, black, white, and mint palette, and a modular, gently shifting
layout to avoid typical artisanal coffee clichés. The result is a
modern, minimal but warm brand that reflects ease, rhythm, and the
idea of being present in a “flow state.”
