NEWS & TRENDS

 3D INSTAGRAM PHOTOS ARE COMING TO META QUEST HEADSETS (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Meta is testing 3D Instagram photos on Quest headsets, utilizing AI
to convert 2D images into immersive formats without the need for
special cameras. The update also introduces Navigator, a new interface
accessed via the Meta button, offering streamlined access to apps,
settings, and notifications. Additional features include Bluetooth Low
Energy support, movable windows, and a unified Horizon app for PC. 

 SKETCH ATHENS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sketch's Athens update introduced Stacks, a new layout tool similar
to Auto Layout in Figma that creates adaptive interfaces with nested
layouts. The release replaced artboards with Frames for UI design and
introduced Graphics containers for icons and illustrations with fixed
proportional sizing. The Command Bar now enables efficient component
insertion and swapping, replacing deeply nested menus with streamlined
access to Symbols, Text Styles, and other design elements. 

 WHATSAPP IS WORKING ON AN EASIER WAY TO LOG OUT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WhatsApp has been testing a new "Logout" feature that allows users to
sign out of the app without deleting or resetting their data, making
it easier to take a break or switch accounts. Currently, logging out
on mobile requires erasing app data or uninstalling the app, unlike
the more flexible options on WhatsApp Web or desktop. This logout
option is still in development, and it's unclear when or if it will be
officially released for Android and iOS users.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 FOR UX, THE FUTURE MUST BE STRATEGIC (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UX professionals are often confined to surface-level roles focused on
aesthetics, which limits their influence despite the critical role
user experience plays in product success. Strategic UX involves
transitioning from outputs to outcomes, products to experiences, and
reactive to proactive approaches, as well as shifting from validation
to expertise grounded in in-depth user research. Making this shift
requires adopting strategic metrics, investing in experiential
research, and articulating bold UX visions that resonate with
executives. 

 IS THE AGE OF THE SPECIALIST OVER IN CREATIVE AGENCIES? (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The creative industry is shifting from valuing narrowly focused
specialists to embracing adaptable, collaborative "T-shaped" creatives
who combine deep expertise with broad, strategic thinking across
disciplines. As AI levels the technical playing field and platforms
rapidly evolve, the future favors those who can curate, communicate,
and connect ideas across design, tech, and culture while maintaining
high standards in their core craft. 

 WHEN DID UX & CONTENT GET SO HARD? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In a world filled with uncertainty, rapid technological change, and
constant digital noise, it's no surprise that starting the day can
feel overwhelming as we try to stay informed, productive, and present.
Taking things slowly, focusing on what truly matters, and allowing
time for rest, learning, and laughter can help ease the pressure and
bring a sense of balance to our everyday lives.

 DEFAULT IT OR DESIGN IT (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designers often lose time on low-impact details instead of focusing
on strategic decisions, which can delay projects and reduce their
overall impact. The "Default it or Design it" framework encourages
teams to use existing solutions for routine choices and reserve
creative effort for areas where differentiation is critical. Product
managers typically prefer defaulting to maintain speed, while
designers lean toward designing for innovation, creating a productive
tension that results in balanced outcomes. Design systems serve as
evolving collections of approved defaults, enabling teams to
concentrate on unique challenges rather than reinventing solved
solutions. 

 IS THE AGE OF THE SPECIALIST OVER IN CREATIVE AGENCIES? (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The creative industry is shifting from celebrating narrow specialists
to valuing "T-shaped" generalists who combine deep expertise in core
areas with broad understanding across disciplines. As AI becomes a
technical equalizer, success increasingly depends on taste, curation,
and strategic thinking, rather than technical skills alone. Creative
leaders emphasize that collaboration and adaptability are increasingly
essential as budgets tighten and platforms fragment rapidly. 

 FROM ARTIFICIAL TO AUTHENTIC (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In a world increasingly shaped by AI prompts and perfection-seeking
tools, creatives are urged to resist the pressure to conform and
instead embrace their unique voices, imperfections, and creative
intuition. True connection and meaningful art emerge not from polished
outputs, but from vulnerability, authenticity, and the courage to be
seen, with all their cracks.
