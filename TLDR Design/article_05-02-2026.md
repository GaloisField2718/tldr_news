 TINDER LOOKS TO AI TO HELP FIGHT ‘SWIPE FATIGUE' AND DATING APP
BURNOUT (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tinder is testing a new AI-powered feature called Chemistry to
address swipe fatigue and dating app burnout by learning users'
interests through questions and optional access to their Camera Roll.
The feature aims to replace endless swiping with a smaller set of more
relevant matches as Tinder faces declining sign-ups, lower engagement,
and subscriber losses. Chemistry is part of a broader strategy that
includes AI-driven recommendations, enhanced safety tools, and
increased marketing spend to improve relevance, trust, and appeal
among Gen Z users. 

 LEAKER SAYS IPHONE 18 PRO KEEPS IPHONE 17 DESIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is expected to keep the iPhone 17 Pro design for the iPhone 18
Pro, focusing less on a visual refresh and more on performance after
strong market reception. The biggest upgrades are likely the A20/A20
Pro 2nm chips for better speed, efficiency, and on-device AI, with
possible front-facing tweaks like a smaller cutout or under-display
Face ID. 

 FIGMA ACHIEVES C5 ACCREDITATION (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figma has achieved C5 accreditation from Germany's Federal Office for
Information Security, strengthening cloud security and compliance for
customers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The accreditation
confirms Figma meets rigorous standards for information security, risk
management, and operational transparency, making it easier for
organizations in the government and finance sectors to use the
platform. This milestone builds on Figma's investment in the DACH
region, where nearly 90% of DAX 40 companies already use the design
collaboration platform.

 DESIGN SYSTEMS TEAM STRUCTURE IN 2026 (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design systems team structures have changed dramatically due to AI
capabilities, with tasks that previously required three people in 2023
now often manageable by a single person with the right AI toolkit.
Teams are struggling not with headcount but with leverage, as AI can
now handle non-judgment work like documentation, auditing, and
scaffolding while humans focus on strategic decisions and relationship
building. The key is implementing systems that create scale before
adding headcount, as teams that understand what to automate versus
what to own can outperform much larger teams stuck in inefficient
workflows. 

 A DESIGN CONVERSATION AT THE APPLE CREATOR EXPERIENCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A designer shared his experience at Apple's LA Creator Experience,
discussing how tools like Pixelmator Pro and iPad help overcome the
fear of starting creative projects. After losing all his work in a
2006 robbery, he started the blog Abduzeedo to document his process
and has been using Pixelmator since 2007. He emphasized that good
design tools matter because they help creators push through initial
creative barriers and start new projects. 

 AI RUNS ON TEXT. SO SHOULD YOU (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI tools like Claude Code are powerful not because they're flashier,
but because they work directly with your existing files, making plain
text the shared language where human thinking and AI collaboration
really scale. The quiet advantage is externalizing your thinking in
accessible text, letting AI synthesize, reorganize, and build on it
over time without complex systems.

 USING DESIGN TOKENS FOR A PROPORTIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SCALE (10 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A proportional typographic scale creates a font size hierarchy using
consistent mathematical ratios, starting with a base size and
multiplying by a fixed ratio to generate larger and smaller sizes.
Design tokens are ideal for creating these scales because they can
reference other tokens' values and contain mathematical calculations,
making it easy to build sophisticated typographic systems with few
tokens. This approach ensures visual harmony and consistency across
designs while making the system scalable and maintainable for both
design and development teams. 

 DESIGNING WITH DATA: A UX RESEARCH GUIDE FOR DESIGNERS (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 UX research involves understanding user needs through methods such as
interviews, surveys, personas, and user testing to inform data-driven
design decisions. Key research methods include surveys for
quantitative data from many users, one-on-one interviews for deep
insights, observation of users in natural environments, and diary
studies to track experiences over time. Effective user interviews
require thorough preparation, relevant questions, and a focused yet
flexible approach to uncover insights that other methods might miss.
