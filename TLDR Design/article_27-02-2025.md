 UNDERSTANDING PRIORITY (OR THE NEXT STEP TO GO FROM UX TO PRODUCT
DESIGN) (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In UX design, prioritization goes beyond usability severity,
considering factors like reach, impact, confidence, and effort.
Methods like RICE help teams strategically address issues, ensuring
the most critical problems—such as account creation
difficulties—are tackled first. 

 DESIGNING FOR STRESS AND EMERGENCY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Design must fit real-world contexts, especially when people are under
stress. Stress disrupts cognition, leading to instinctive decisions.
Clear, simple interfaces help users focus. Prioritizing tasks,
breaking them into steps, and adding safeguards prevent mistakes.
Emergency modes improve response times. Regular stress testing ensures
usability, making digital products more reliable in high-pressure
situations.

users attributed autonomy. Unexpected AI behavior affected trust,
prompting calls for clearer, more explicit faces, transparency, and

that accounts for diverse user interpretations and experiences.
