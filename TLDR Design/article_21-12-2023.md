 MAKING NOISY SVGS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There has been an emergence of texture instead of clean, flat shapes,

‚Äúnoisy‚Äù or grainy texture. The cool thing about this style of
illustrations is that they can be done entirely with SVG.

MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Creating clear and aligned processes within teams requires process

 DYNAMIC PICTOGRAMS FOR DESIGN SYSTEMS (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Typically, pictograms are vector graphics illustrations with various
colors, backgrounds, accents, and skin colors. Each option requires a
different SVG file, potentially resulting in too many assets unless a
more dynamic and scalable method is used.

 Many designers have pointed to the recent Johnson & Johnson rebrand
