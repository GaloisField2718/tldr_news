 CREATORS VS. ARTISTS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Legendary Japanese animation film director Hayao Miyazaki's work was
recently reinterpreted by AI, leading to an exciting discussion of the

using AI or not.

READ) [10]

design methods inwards ‚Äî if we can give up our Superman myth.

users.

 THE ELEVATOR TEST (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Even though prototypes are essential in design work, they should
never be treated as permanent. In the elevator test, prototypes are
smashed using elevator doors. The lesson is that prototypes are tools
to improve your final product. Stay attached to them and focus on the
learning process they enable. 

 DESIGNING WITH INTEGRITY: THE ETHICAL DESIGNER‚ÄôS HANDBOOK ON DARK
PATTERNS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pursuing innovation and engagement at all costs can easily lead to
dark patterns - deceptive design tactics that manipulate users into
doing stuff they don't want to do. This kind of manipulation leaves a
trail of frustration, distrust, and negativity. This post explores the
prevalence of dark patterns and how to avoid them using ethical design
principles as a guide.

resourcing spikes.

 EVERYONE'S OBSESSED WITH THIS UNUSED FORD LOGO DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 During the 1960s, Henry Ford II enlisted Paul Rand, the famed graphic
designer who had created logos for IBM, ABC, and UPS, to modernize the
logo and its script. Users on Reddit and X are now praising the sleek
and fantastic design, which retained the original's essential features
but used a more modern, even-stroked lettering. 

 WORLD‚ÄôS OLDEST UNCHANGED BRAND CHANGES LOGO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
OVER 140 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 For over 140 years, Lyle‚Äôs Golden Syrup has featured an interesting
logo on its tin: a lion‚Äôs carcass surrounded by bees. The product
was recognized by Guinness World Records for having the world‚Äôs
oldest branding and packaging. For the first time since the 1880s,
Lyle's Golden Syrup is undergoing a major redesign to appeal to a
21st-century audience. 

 NENDO DESIGNED THE PERFECT OBSESSIVELY ERGONOMIC FORK FOR EATING CUP
NOODLES (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 It's not easy to scoop noodles with the standard fork that comes with
cup noodles. The fork's angle does not sit right, making it
un-ergonomic and difficult to scoop. Nissin and Nendo created a piece
of cutlery that is obsessively ergonomic, designed after hours of user
observation to ensure a seamless noodle-eating experience.
