 LOGITECH'S FIRST META QUEST STYLUS HELPS ARTISTS WORK IN 3D (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The MX Ink stylus, Logitech's first mixed reality tool for Meta Quest
2 and 3 headsets, offers a natural, pencil-like feel for 3D content
creation. It has features like swappable pressure-sensitive tips and
haptic feedback, which enhance the creative process for AR and VR
artists. Despite its $129.99 price tag and lack of Meta Quest Pro
support, its release later this year could be an excellent addition to
advancing 3D design. 

 HOW ADOBE CANCELED ITSELF (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The FTC is suing Adobe for deceptive practices, accusing it of
forcing consumers into year-long subscriptions with hidden fees. Price
hikes and concerning terms-of-service updates have further fueled
discontent among users, including Adobe's employees. As criticisms and
alternative software suggestions circulate, the company's reputation
faces significant challenges, compounded by allegations of misleading
terms and AI ethics issues. 

 META IS TAGGING REAL PHOTOS AS ‚ÄòMADE WITH AI,' SAY PHOTOGRAPHERS (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta's recent initiative to label AI-generated photos on its social
platforms has been met with backlash for inaccurately tagging real
photos as ‚ÄúMade with AI.‚Äù This issue has affected numerous
photographers, who argue that the label should not apply to images
merely edited with tools like Adobe's cropping feature. Meta has
acknowledged the feedback and is re-evaluating its approach to ensure
the labels accurately reflect the use of AI, working with AI tool
providers to refine the detection and application process.

QUESTION YOU CAN ASK (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Output-first thinking persists in product development despite 26
years of advocating for "outcomes over outputs". Generative AI is used

outputs rather than generating new ones.
