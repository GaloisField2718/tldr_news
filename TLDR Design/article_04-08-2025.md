NEWS & TRENDS

 IOS 18 VS IOS 26 COMPARED: HERE'S ALL THE NEW APP ICONS COMING TO
YOUR IPHONE HOME SCREEN (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 iOS 26 introduces a major visual overhaul with the “Liquid Glass”
redesign, featuring entirely redrawn system app icons for the first
time since iOS 7 and unifying the look across all Apple platforms. The
new icons adopt a consistent squircle shape, refined edge spacing, and
dynamic glass effects, creating a more cohesive and modern aesthetic
that responds to device motion. 

 IDEOGRAM CHARACTER (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ideogram's Character is a character consistency model that requires
only one reference image to generate infinite character variations.
The feature is now available free to all users on ideogram.ai and the
iOS app. Users can combine Character with existing tools like Magic
Fill and Describe/Remix for enhanced customization. 

 WITH ‘THE UNFINISHED FILM,' ADOBE INVITES CREATORS TO COMPLETE THE
STORY USING AI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe's "The Unfinished Film" is a collaborative endeavor directed by
Sam Finn, where only the beginning exists. The initiative invites
creators to use Adobe Firefly AI tools to produce their own endings
for the incomplete movie. The project showcases Firefly's creative
capabilities while coinciding with rival Figma's public market debut.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 LINA KHAN POINTS TO FIGMA IPO AS VINDICATION OF M&A SCRUTINY (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Lina Khan, former FTC chair, celebrated Figma's successful IPO as a
vindication of her stance against Big Tech acquisitions, arguing that
blocking Adobe's attempted $20B takeover allowed Figma to grow
independently and deliver greater value. While Khan framed the IPO as
a win for innovation and competition, critics argue Figma's success
stems from its own merits, not regulatory intervention. 

 FROM “HOW MIGHT WE” TO “AT WHAT COST” (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The tragic story of a 14-year-old who died after extended
interactions with a chatbot highlights the urgent need for designers
and technologists to move beyond the reckless “move fast and break
things” mindset and take responsibility for the real-world
consequences of their work. By pairing the curiosity-driven question
“How might we?” with the critical lens of “At what cost?”,
designers can better anticipate unintended harms, ensuring that
innovation is guided by both possibility and responsibility. 

 THERE'S LOGIC BEHIND YOUR GUT FEELING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Abduction—the logic of the best guess—is a foundational way
humans form beliefs and generate new ideas. Doubt and uncertainty are
necessary starting points for real insight. Unlike deduction or
induction, abduction helps designers, researchers, and even AI users
explore possibilities and test hypotheses. Thoughtful questioning, not
premature certainty, leads to deeper learning and more responsible
innovation.

identity by Derek&Eric and strategist Silas Amos, aiming to resolve

 IOS 26 DIARY: MUCH WORK REMAINS, BUT I LOVE THE NEW LOOK AND THE
DIRECTION (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 iOS 26 brings the biggest visual overhaul to the iPhone in years with
its "Liquid Glass" aesthetic, refreshed icons, and redesigned apps
like Camera and Photos—changes that some find unintuitive at first
but ultimately streamline everyday use. While promising features like
Call Screening, Hold Assist, and Apple Intelligence show potential,
many remain limited or unreliable in this beta stage, leaving users
hopeful but still waiting—especially for the long-promised smarter
Siri. 

 SERVICE DESIGN ISN'T JUST A BUZZWORD – IT MAKES HAPPIER PEOPLE (10
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Service design focuses on connecting customer touchpoints across
entire journeys rather than creating individual apps or products. This
invisible discipline makes people happier by removing barriers and
solving broader problems. Design companies lag in adopting this
strategic approach that transforms services and addresses societal
challenges.
