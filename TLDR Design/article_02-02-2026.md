NEWS & TRENDS

 IPHONE 18 PRO VS IPHONE FOLD: THESE CAMERA FEATURES ARE RUMORED (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Apple's fall lineup is rumored to shrink to just iPhone 18 Pro, 18
Pro Max, and iPhone Fold, effectively giving buyers a choice between
Pro or Fold, with cameras as a key differentiator. The 18 Pro models
are expected to keep two camera advantages over the Fold—variable
aperture on the main camera and a telephoto lens with wider
aperture—while the Fold may skip telephoto entirely. 

 PIXELMATOR PRO, ONE OF THE BEST IMAGE EDITING APPS, FINALLY LANDS ON
THE IPAD (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pixelmator Pro, a highly regarded Mac image editing app and Photoshop
alternative, has finally launched on iPad as part of Apple's Creator
Studio bundle. The app features a layer-based editing system, advanced
tools, and machine learning capabilities, such as automatic background
removal, all optimized for touch and Apple Pencil input. Projects sync
seamlessly between iPad and Mac devices. It requires iPadOS 26 or
later with an A16/A17 Pro chip or newer.

 SYSTEMS COLLAPSE: WHY CREATIVE EDUCATION NEEDS A BAUHAUS-SIZED RESET
(8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amid AI, climate crisis, and deep uncertainty, creative education
needs radical reimagining—from exam-led silos to a Bauhaus-like,
process-driven model centred on making, systems thinking, judgment,
and agency. Creativity should become the foundation of learning,
reconnecting education, industry, and policy to rebuild confidence,
empathy, and responsibility in a world where execution matters less
than meaning. 

 AI IS FINALLY LEARNING TO SHUT UP (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI interface design is shifting away from chat-based conversations
toward one-click, ambient actions that remove friction by acting
directly in context while keeping humans in control. Conversation is
often overhead: the most effective AI minimizes interaction,
translates intuitive user intent into precise machine instructions,
and reserves chat only for ambiguous, educational, or emotional tasks.


 FROM DESIGN-FIRST TO MOTION-DRIVEN: DYLAN BROUWER'S JOURNEY INTO THE
NO-CODE FRONTIER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Dylan Brouwer is a Dutch digital designer and Webflow developer who
creates expressive, animated websites using no-code tools like Webflow
and GSAP. His recent portfolio showcases his ability to blend bold
visuals with intuitive UX, including a complex homepage hero with a
3D-rotating display and scroll-triggered animations. He also worked on
Palmer Dinnerware's website at UNCOMMON, reimagining it as an
immersive digital canvas rather than a traditional e-commerce catalog.

 GIRAFFE, MUPPET, OR HUMAN? (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Designing VR avatars for children works best when they strike a
balance of moderate realism: clearly non-human but plausible (like an
animal), avoiding both hyper-realistic humans and overly fantastical
characters that can feel creepy or confusing. Research shows
consistency matters most—appearance, proportions, movement
(especially eyes), and distance must align—because mismatches
intensify discomfort in VR, where kids' emotions and sense of reality
are heightened. 

 THE MOST LOVED AND LOATHED FONTS ACCORDING TO CREATIVE PROS (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Adobe's study of 415 discussions from creative professionals revealed
the most loved and loathed fonts in the design community. Lato topped
the loved list for being clean and versatile, while Comic Sans
predictably ranked as the most hated for its childish appearance. The
study showed that "safe" fonts like Arial are often more offensive to
creatives than genuinely bad fonts, and trend fatigue has made
previously popular fonts like Montserrat undesirable. 

 VOLKSWAGEN UX DESIGN LEAD UNVEILS ‘SECRET SAUCE' (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Volkswagen's UX design lead, Mathias Kuhn, revealed the company's
three core values for user experience design: stable, likeable, and
exciting, which he calls their "secret sauce." The approach focuses on
user-centricity, with customer feedback integral to design decisions,
as seen in the new ID Polo cockpit, which blends modern software with
retro elements. Kuhn emphasizes using AI as a conductor to seamlessly
integrate various technologies while maintaining simple, intuitive
interfaces that avoid tech overload.
