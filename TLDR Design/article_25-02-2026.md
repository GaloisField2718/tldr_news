NEWS & TRENDS

 CANVA ACQUIRES STARTUPS WORKING ON ANIMATION AND MARKETING (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Canva has acquired animation startup Cavalry and marketing AI company
MangoAI to expand its creative and advertising capabilities. Cavalry's
2D motion tools will be added to Affinity, giving Canva a more
complete professional suite that now includes motion editing alongside
photo, vector, and layout design. MangoAI's reinforcement learning
technology aims to improve video ad performance and measurement,
strengthening Canva's push into marketing as it builds on tools like
Canva Grow and MagicBrief. 

 OPKEY LAUNCHES DESIGN STUDIO TO AUTOMATE ENTERPRISE CLOUD APPLICATION
DISCOVERY AND DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Opkey launched Design Studio, an AI-powered suite that automates
enterprise cloud application discovery and design processes from
statement-of-work creation through configuration. The platform uses
Argus, a domain-specific AI model trained on over 200 terabytes of
enterprise application data, to manage the entire application
lifecycle and reduce manual work. Opkey claims the system can
accelerate Oracle and Workday implementations by up to 50% while
reducing delivery effort and improving project margins for systems
integrators. 

 BLUESKY DARK MODE AVAILABLE ON MOBILE AND WEB (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bluesky offers Light, Dim, Dark, and System appearance options across
iOS, Android, web, and desktop, letting users manually choose a theme
or sync with their device's dark mode schedule. Dark mode can improve
comfort in low light and save battery life—especially on OLED
screens—while Dim provides a softer alternative. If issues arise,
updating the app or checking system-wide dark settings usually
resolves them.

 HOW I'M DEALING WITH THE PRESSURE TO ADOPT AI AS A DESIGNER (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A designer overcame AI-related career anxiety by realizing his
control over which AI tools to adopt based on whether they improve
work quality. With the development of a "six-month rule", he was able
to avoid hype cycles by waiting to see which AI tools remain relevant
and useful after initial excitement fades. The key is to focus on
actual work outcomes rather than industry noise, and to experiment
with tools broadly but only implement those that genuinely enhance
results. 

 YOUR AI FEATURE WORKS. SO WHY DON'T USERS CARE? (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Transparency alone isn't enough to build trust in AI. Real adoption
depends on aligning AI features with users' existing mental models,
habits, comfort zones, and cognitive limits. To move beyond early
adopters, AI must fit how people already think and work—starting
with low-stakes, “outsource-safe” tasks, mirroring familiar
workflows, managing expectations clearly, and respecting human
pace—because trust begins with alignment, not just explanation. 

 DESIGNING PRODUCTION-READY UIS WITH YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM USING
MOONCHILD AI (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Using Moonchild's new Design System feature significantly accelerated
MVP development for a restaurant management product by establishing a
mini design system—tokens, components, and visual rules—before
generating UI screens. This system-first approach ensured strong
visual consistency, reduced iteration waste, improved design-to-code
alignment, and, combined with ChatGPT for research and Antigravity for
frontend implementation, resulted in a workflow nearly 10x faster than
previous AI-driven methods.

 HOW TO DESIGN FOR TRANSPARENT SCREENS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 David Allin Reese, a Senior Visual Designer at Google, shares
insights on designing Jetpack Compose Glimmer, a new design system for
AI glasses that projects interfaces onto transparent displays. The
unique challenges included designing without traditional screen
boundaries, where the interface appears at arm's length in the user's
field of view and requires conscious shifts in focus from the real
world. Key technical constraints included additive display technology
and the need to rethink fundamental design elements such as color,
typography, and shadows. 

 WHAT A UX AUDIT REALLY REVEALS ABOUT YOUR PRODUCT'S PERFORMANCE (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A UX Audit systematically evaluates a digital product to identify
usability issues, structural weaknesses, and friction points that hurt
conversions, engagement, and growth. It examines real user behavior
through heuristic evaluation, analytics data, and qualitative
insights. The audit prioritizes findings by business impact and
transforms them into a strategic roadmap, enabling teams to make
evidence-based improvements. 

 WHY READING ON MOBILE IS UNIQUELY CHALLENGING (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Mobile reading happens in distracted, fragmented conditions, which
significantly reduces comprehension. Research shows understanding can
drop from about 39% on desktop to just 19% on mobile. Cloze tests,
which measure whether readers can reconstruct missing words from
context, reveal how easily meaning breaks down on small screens and
highlight the need for simpler, clearer writing—especially for
high-stakes content—because mobile usability isn't just about
layout, but about whether people truly understand what they read when
attention is limited.
