 IPHONE MARKET SHARE NOW BIGGER THAN SAMSUNG, NOT JUST DUE TO IPHONE
17 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple pulled ahead of Samsung in global smartphone market share by
the end of 2025, reaching 20% with the highest year-on-year shipment
growth (10%), driven by strong demand in emerging markets and the
success of both the iPhone 17 and iPhone 16. Despite expected market
contraction due to rising memory costs, both Apple and Samsung are
well-positioned to cope thanks to strong supply-chain control and
pricing power.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BREAKING OUT OF THE INDUSTRY BOX: DESIGNERS' SKILLS WORK ANYWHERE (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Designers often feel trapped in a single industry because employers
prioritize vertical expertise, but transferable skills like systems
thinking, enterprise UX, and technical constraint balancing apply
across sectors. Reframing healthcare design experience around
horizontal strengths that AI tools cannot replicate enabled a
transition beyond the initial industry box. To break out of industry
constraints, designers should identify what makes their work unique,
discuss projects with others to find cross-industry parallels, and
research target sectors to craft relevant narratives. 

 GHOSTING TO MONEY WORRIES – REPORT OUTLINES FREELANCE CHALLENGES (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A survey by Leapers shows more people are being pushed into
freelancing due to layoffs, with those who had “little other
choice” reporting much worse mental health than those who chose it.
Falling incomes, AI anxiety, poor client behavior, loneliness, and
lack of time off are driving stress, yet many freelancers remain
cautiously optimistic and still see freelancing as a sustainable
future. 

 THE DILEMMA OF AGENCY IN DESIGN (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers who want to create social and environmental impact often
have limited agency, so real change depends on winning buy-in from
organisations. The key is to understand how the organisation works,
align ideas with KPIs, make strong business cases, use consumer
pressure, build alliances, and start with small actions that compound
into bigger change.

 TOP 10 WEB3 UX DESIGN TRENDS TO FOLLOW IN 2026 (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Web3 applications are shifting from technical complexity to
user-centric design through 10 key trends, including wallet
abstraction that eliminates seed phrases, progressive disclosure for
gradual learning, transparent transaction previews,
accessibility-first interfaces with dark mode, unified portfolio
dashboards, and real-time data visualization. These trends address
critical barriers like intimidating onboarding, information overload,
and transaction anxiety. For B2B and AI SaaS platforms entering Web3,
implementing these design patterns isn't optional but essential for
mainstream adoption, user trust, and competitive differentiation. 

 YOU'RE NOT IN EXILE, YOU'RE ON THE FOREFRONT OF A CHANGE (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A creative in the Midlands feels stuck working with clients who
resist ideas from outside their local bubble, seeing anything “too
ambitious” as being “for London” and settling for what worked
years ago nearby. Designers must act as educators and salespeople.
Regional creatives aren't in exile, but at the start of future change.

identity and real-guest photography, and revamped the digital
experience with better booking tools—creating a clear, scalable
