design systems by making code snippets more accessible to developers,
facilitating better collaboration and consistent use across
organizations. The beta release for Figma Organization and Enterprise

 YOUR APP IS NOT A PRODUCT (10 MINUTE READ) [7]

represent the iterative nature of software development and foster
improved understanding among stakeholders.

process stage fosters creativity and prevents the stifling effects of
rigid methodologies.
