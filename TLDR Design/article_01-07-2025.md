MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google resumed the rollout of its AI-powered "Ask Photos" search
feature for Google Photos after previously pausing it due to
performance issues. The updated tool now delivers faster results for
simple searches, such as "beach" or "dogs," by showing immediate
results while Gemini AI models continue processing more complex
queries in the background. The feature is expanding beyond early
access to more eligible users in the U.S. 

 GETTY DROPS KEY COPYRIGHT CLAIMS AGAINST STABILITY AI, BUT UK LAWSUIT
CONTINUES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Getty Images dropped its main copyright infringement claims against
Stability AI in London's High Court, though the UK lawsuit continues
with secondary infringement and trademark claims. Legal experts
suggest that Getty withdrew the claims due to weak evidence and
jurisdictional issues related to AI training outside the UK. A
separate US lawsuit seeking $1.7 billion in damages remains active.

 I'VE OVERDESIGNED BEFORE — HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT DOING
LESS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Overdesign often occurs when aesthetics are prioritized over
usability or when UX best practices are misapplied. Common examples of
overdesign include unnecessary hamburger menus that hide important
navigation and "whiplash" layouts that disrupt the natural reading
direction. Underdesign, on the other hand, manifests through poor
color contrast and inaccessible typography. UX designers can avoid
overdesign by conducting thorough research, presenting content in a
way that aligns with users' natural reading flow, ensuring that
accessibility fundamentals are met, and questioning whether design
elements serve real purposes beyond aesthetics. 

 14 LOGIC-DRIVEN UI DESIGN TIPS TO IMPROVE ANY INTERFACE (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A seasoned product designer outlines 14 logic-driven guidelines for
improving user interfaces, emphasizing that effective UI design relies
on structured principles rather than artistic intuition. They
illustrate these tips through a before-and-after redesign of a
community blogging platform's profile page, addressing issues such as
spacing, contrast ratios, button hierarchy, and accessibility
standards. Key principles include using proximity to show
relationships between elements, ensuring sufficient contrast for
accessibility, limiting primary buttons to one per screen, and
maintaining consistency throughout the interface.

strategic roles as system-builders, educators, and brand guardians to
