 THE DESIGN MANAGER‚ÄôS TOOLKIT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The essence of design leadership lies in the balance of being a
catalyst for inspiring visions while also nurturing an environment
where practical, achievable ideas can thrive. With a clear North Star,

 WHY IT'S TIME FOR RESEARCH TO MOVE BEYOND UX (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The tech industry's recent layoffs have sparked debates on
organizational structures, highlighting the need to separate Research
from User Experience (UX) to better serve companies. As research
matures, it should evolve into an independent intelligence function,
rather than being confined within UX, to broaden its impact across all
areas of a business. 

 DESIGNING FOR SAFE AND TRUSTWORTHY AI (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Current AI systems seek to mitigate AI mistakes by requiring human
oversight, keeping humans in the loop, and relying on them to detect
and fix the AI output if needed. However, human oversight to make up
for AI errors doesn‚Äôt work because AI is not transparent, displaying
AI explanations and a confidence score can cause over-reliance, people
act more risky when supported by AI, AI support leads to less
cognitive engagement, and judging AI output takes time and mental
capacity.
