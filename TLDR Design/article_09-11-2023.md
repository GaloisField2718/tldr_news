MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google revamped its shopping experience to help its users find good
deals. The new features include a dedicated deals page, active
promotion notifications on "Resume browsing" cards, price insights in
Chrome on the desktop, and price tracking on products you're searching
for. 

 THE 2024 STATE OF THE WEBSITE (WEBSITE) [7] 

 A survey conducted by Webflow in partnership with Vanson Bourne
surveyed 500 marketing leaders in the U.S. and North America about
their current websites. On average, marketing teams spend $1.6M on
website teams and software each year, making websites an increasingly
expensive and time-consuming asset. Most respondents affirmed that
other teams and developers currently restrict their teams.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE GULF BETWEEN DESIGN AND ENGINEERING (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The way most organizations produce digital products is fundamentally
broken. The elephant in the room is a dated understanding of the role
of both design and engineering, which in turn shapes how organizations
hire, manage, and produce digital things. These companies invest
billions of dollars building teams, processes, and tools on top of an
immature discipline and an outdated waterfall model that ends up being
detrimental to productivity, team happiness, and ultimately, the
resulting experiences we bring to life. 

 BUILDING A DRAWER COMPONENT (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 How to rebuild the Apple‚Äôs Sheet component but for the web using
React. To close it, users can just ‚Äúflick it‚Äù instead of dragging
it down. Dragging it upwards beyond its size will cause a minor
slow-down animation to reflect how items move in real life. Scrolling
inside the drawer is also made possible and the background gets
animated just like it does on iOS. 

 SYSTEMS OF HARM: 3 PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE
DESIGN SYSTEMS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Proponents of design systems emphasize their efficiency, consistency,
and scalability. Nevertheless, efficiency is only valuable if it
enables us to improve our products and services faster. Consistency is
only valuable if we standardize things to a high standard. Scaling
things is only worthwhile if they are worth reproducing. Our work is
irrelevant and even harmful if we don't reorient the design system
practice towards real value.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 üöÄ¬†RETAIL SUCCESS STORY IN THE MAKING (SPONSOR) [11]

smart home tech company, is launching in 100+ Best Buy stores [11],
and you're in luck ‚Äî you can still invest at only $1.25/share [11]
before their name becomes known nationwide.

 FROM IMAGE ADJUSTMENTS TO AI: PHOTOSHOP THROUGH THE YEARS (14 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 From simple cropping and image adjustments to layers and cloud
support, Photoshop has been on a long and winding road over the last
three-and-a-half decades. With twenty-four versions, over a dozen logo
changes, and a rich history of updates, Adobe‚Äôs magnum opus has
cemented itself as the one true king of image editing platforms. And
yet, despite the platform‚Äôs rich history, Generative AI will likely
enter the records as the most significant Photoshop update ever. 

 ORGANIZING YOUR CREATIVE WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Organization and communication are unavoidable inefficiencies in work
processes, but you can minimize their impact. A system of
organization, especially when powered by AI, lets you focus on
creating rather than moving stuff around.

new text and image assets in just a few clicks. Google Ads will also
feature AI-powered image editing capabilities that enhance generated
and existing assets. The invisible SynthID watermark will be applied
to all generative AI images created in Google Ads.
