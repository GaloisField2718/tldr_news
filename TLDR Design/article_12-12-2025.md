 INTRODUCING THREE NEW TOOLS FOR PRECISE IMAGE EDITING IN FIGMA (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma launched three AI-powered image editing tools—Erase object,
Isolate object, and Expand image—alongside a unified toolbar that
consolidates existing capabilities, such as Remove background and AI
generation. These features enable designers to precisely remove or
isolate objects, extend backgrounds to fit different aspect ratios,
and perform detailed edits without leaving the Figma canvas. The tools
are available now to Full seat users on Professional, Organization,
and Enterprise plans with AI enabled. Broader platform availability
has been planned for next year. 

 NEW APPLE STUDIO DISPLAY RUMORED TO UPGRADE THREE KEY FEATURES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's next Studio Display, expected in 2026, is rumored to include
three big upgrades: an A19 chip, ProMotion 120Hz, and HDR support. HDR
strongly suggests Apple will swap the current LCD for a Mini-LED panel
to achieve higher brightness. Even without other changes, these
additions would mark a substantial improvement over today's
A13-powered, 60Hz, SDR Studio Display. The launch is expected to align
with high-end M5 Macs in 2026. Leaks also point to a second upcoming
Apple monitor and an iPad using the same A19 chip. 

 INTERTYPE STUDIO LEADS FIRST GREY GOOSE REDESIGN IN THE VODKA'S
HISTORY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Grey Goose has completed its first major redesign since 1997, with
Intertype Studio modernizing the brand while preserving its French
elegance. The bottle is now slimmer and lighter. The logotype and
mountain scene were redrawn, the number of geese was reduced, and a
bespoke typeface was introduced. Flavour-range artwork was refreshed
with new outdoor oil paintings, and the new premium vodka Altius
received a sculptural, glacial-inspired bottle. The update aims to
balance heritage with contemporary expectations. Early results
indicate the subtle evolution is landing well.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR PERFECTIONISM IS LYING TO YOU (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perfectionism masquerades as a virtue but actually hinders creative
success by causing procrastination, preventing completion, and
ironically degrading work quality through obsessive refinement that
loses the original spark. The solution lies in shifting from pursuing
perfection to becoming prolific—completing projects quickly and
moving on to the next, which accelerates skill development and,
paradoxically, improves overall quality. Embracing a "done for now"
mindset and treating creativity like tending a garden rather than
chiseling stone allows greatness to emerge naturally through abundant
creation. 

 AI CODING AGENTS FOR DESIGNERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI coding agents, already writing the majority of code at companies
like Anthropic and OpenAI, offer designers new capabilities beyond
traditional prototyping. Designers can now fix production bugs
directly, learn system architecture by observing agent processes, and
better determine when engineering collaboration is needed. These tools
require a deep understanding of the codebase to work effectively, with
context engines optimized for complex codebases being essential to
success. 

 THE US GOVERNMENT'S NEW FONT HAS DESIGNERS BEWILDERED (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Designers are baffled after Marco Rubio ordered the US State
Department to abandon Calibri and return to Times New Roman, framing
the move as undoing a “wasteful DEIA program.” The design
community sees the idea of a “woke font” as absurd, and many argue
the switch is a backwards step—Times New Roman was made for old
printing conditions, while Calibri was chosen for modern screen
readability. Even Calibri's designer called the decision “amusing
and regrettable,” and most observers note that what's truly wasteful
is changing the default font twice in two years.

 SYSTEMS, STABLES, AND STARS (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Even mature organizations with sophisticated systems consistently
rely on the same handful of star performers for critical, high-stakes
problems rather than routing work through standard channels. Systems
effectively raise the floor by handling routine work at scale, but
star performers raise the ceiling by tackling novel, ambiguous
challenges that resist systematization. The key is using both
strategically: building robust systems for predictable work while
maintaining a parallel structure where exceptional talent operates as
"free agents," moving fluidly across boundaries to address
unprecedented problems. 

 ON THE CONSUMPTION OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT AT SCALE (16 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 AI-generated content is eroding the ability to process information
through signal degradation and through verification erosion, as
generating plausible content has become cheap while verifying accuracy
remains expensive and difficult. This matters because consumers losing
the ability to distinguish quality from mediocrity threatens both
safety and the development of taste. Two potential solutions: teach AI
systems the reasoning behind communication techniques rather than just
the patterns, and ground AI confidence in "hypothetical grounding
spaces". 

 DNCO REIMAGINES AMSTERDAM'S ZUIDAS AS 'ZUDO': A NEW VILLAGE IDENTITY
FOR THE CITY'S BUSINESS DISTRICT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Zuidas, Amsterdam's business district, long viewed as a cold
corporate district, is being rebranded as a place people might
genuinely want to live. After extensive community research, DNCO
introduced Zudo—“a village for Zuidas”—an identity that blends
business ambition with neighbourhood warmth. With a custom hybrid
typeface, playful bilingual wording, and everyday illustrations, the
branding highlights human-scale living and has been well received by
residents and the city.
