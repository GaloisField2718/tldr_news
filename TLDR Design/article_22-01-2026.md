NEWS & TRENDS

 NOTHING'S NEW LOGO IS GIVING ME JAGUAR FLASHBACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Nothing teased a stripped-back, minimalist wordmark that many fans
disliked, seeing it as another “soulless” rebrand similar to
Jaguar's. While some welcomed the change, others felt it abandoned
Nothing's distinctive pixel-style identity. Even if the tease was just
playful, reactions show how strongly fans care about brand personality
and fear losing originality. 

 FLUX.2 [KLEIN]: TOWARDS INTERACTIVE VISUAL INTELLIGENCE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 FLUX.2 [klein] is a family of compact image generation models that
unify creation and editing with inference speeds under one second. The
lineup includes 9B and 4B parameter variants offering text-to-image,
image editing, and multi-reference generation. The models deliver
performance comparable to systems five times larger while supporting
real-time workflows. Quantized FP8 and NVFP4 versions are available
for further optimization. 

 IPHONE 18 PRO DYNAMIC ISLAND CONFUSION NOW APPEARS TO BE RESOLVED (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reports claiming the iPhone 18 Pro would drop the Dynamic Island or
move the selfie camera were based on a mistranslation, according to
reliable leakers and display analyst Ross Young. The selfie camera
will stay centered, there will still be a (smaller) visible cutout for
Face ID, and the Dynamic Island will remain essentially unchanged.

 WEB DESIGN COLOR THEORY: HOW TO BUILD BRANDS AND IMPROVE UX WITH
COLOR (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Web design color theory applies color principles to create
aesthetically pleasing designs that enhance both functionality and the
user experience, using methods such as the 3-color rule and the
60-30-10 ratio. Designers can choose from seven color
schemes—monochromatic, analogous, complementary,
split-complementary, triadic, tetradic, and achromatic—each offering
different visual effects from cohesive to vibrant. Successful color
selection requires defining brand identity, selecting appropriate
schemes, ensuring accessibility and contrast, and testing designs
across devices before implementation. 

 WHAT MAKES GENERATED UI WORTH KEEPING? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-generated UI often gets discarded because it ignores real product
constraints and is treated as a disposable demo rather than a usable
starting point. Generated designs become valuable when three things
are built in from the start: real brand styling, real data, and reuse
of existing UI patterns—so teams can refine instead of rebuilding.
When AI tools integrate these constraints, their output survives past
the demo phase and actually fits into real product development
workflows. 

 CREATIVES SHARE THEIR TIPS FOR BEATING THE BLUE MONDAYS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 “Blue Monday” is largely a marketing myth, and many creatives
cope with January by embracing it rather than fighting it. They stay
active, plan small things to look forward to, connect with others, and
accept winter as a time for rest, reflection, and lower expectations.
The takeaway is to find what works for you—movement, connection,
comfort, or quiet—and use January as a chance to recharge instead of
forcing productivity.

 DESIGN TOOLS ARE THE NEW DESIGN DELIVERABLES (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A designer has created a custom web tool that generates on-brand
character illustrations, demonstrating how AI-powered software can
replace traditional static design deliverables. The LukeW Character
Maker uses advanced image models, combined with language model
oversight and validation, to produce variations of the designer's
iconic green avatar while maintaining consistent brand guidelines.
This approach enables clients to create their own assets whenever
needed, rather than relying on fixed deliverables or requesting new
work from the designer. 

 JACQUELINE COLLEY ON WHY YOU DON'T NEED BIG COMMISSIONS TO MAKE IT AS
AN ILLUSTRATOR (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Jacqueline Colley shows that illustrators don't need big-name
commissions to succeed: she built a sustainable career by selling her
own illustrated products through markets, online shops, and small
independent retailers, gradually learning what sells and refining her
process. By combining multiple income streams—products, wholesale,
commissions, teaching, and licensing—and focusing on tangible,
niche, community-driven work, she's created long-term stability
without relying on chasing high-profile clients. 

 HOW DID CASERNE MAKE HEALTH FOOD BRANDING FEEL LESS INTIMIDATING? (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Caserne rebranded Quebec health retailer Avril by amplifying what
already made it distinctive, turning its existing “growth” symbol
into a flexible system that organizes everything from signage to
packaging. Combined with bold illustrations, vibrant color, and warm
typography, the identity shifts health from strict and intimidating to
accessible and joyful. The result reassures loyal customers while
inviting new ones, positioning Avril to expand without losing its
credibility or values.
