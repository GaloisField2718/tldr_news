 BUILDING COMPONENTS FOR CONSUMPTION, NOT COMPLEXITY (23 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Components accelerate design-to-engineering timeframes and increase
return on investment (ROI) for design teams. However, the first step
is adoption. This two-part series discusses best naming conventions,
indexing/search, auto-layout best practices, and how to motivate your
designers to use your complex, well-built system. 

 THE SWEET SPOT FOR DESIGN SYSTEM WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Many design systems start when a designer and engineer makes a
handful of components they don‚Äôt want to keep making from scratch
repeatedly ‚Äî that‚Äôs one side of the spectrum. On the other side of
the spectrum are teams who see the value of working directly with the
people who use their components but take it too far and turn it into a
design system as a service.

first, simplify then add lightness, optimize for learnability, be
aware of the context, use multiple modalities, communicate the system
status, proactive error prevention and graceful recovery, and bridge
disciplines.

 CHARGE YOUR WORTH (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Design, like any other business, is a form of servitude. We exist for
others (for a fee). To ignore the other side and pick numbers out of
thin air is an easy way to serve no one. Our ‚Äúworth‚Äù is what
someone else is willing to pay us for the work we provide, so charging
more or less doesn‚Äôt make us more or less worthy as professionals
than other designers. 

 WHEN AI IS THE NEW KING - THAN IA AND UX IS THE QUEEN (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 AI uses context to understand complex relationships, but it relies on
data gathered or previous interactions. Information architecture (IA)
is the missing link that provides an effective framework for analyzing
big data when dealing with unstructured or partially structured data.

 DESIGN FOR THEM, NOT FOR YOU ‚Äî DESIGNING FOR REALITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A designer's role requires you to shift your perspective from
personal preferences to customer-centricity. The only way to design
solutions that resonate and elevate the user experience is to remove
personal preferences, understand users, and iterate constantly, with
user-centered victories becoming the gold standard for evaluating
design efforts.
