 GOOGLE REVEALS MYSTERY AI IMAGE MODEL THAT CAN SMARTLY EDIT PHOTOS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's AI image model, “Nano Banana,” is actually Gemini 2.5
Flash Image, a powerful tool that blends images, maintains character
consistency, and performs precise edits via natural language prompts.
Capable of tasks like changing clothing colors, altering poses, or
removing objects, it outperforms similar apps and will be integrated
into Adobe Firefly and Adobe Express for seamless creative workflows. 

 META'S NEW ULTRA-THIN FLAT-PANEL DISPLAY COULD CHANGE THE FUTURE OF
SCREENS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta developed an ultra-thin laser display, just two millimeters
thick, that produces bright, high-resolution images with a wider color
range. The breakthrough utilizes a photonic integrated circuit
combined with a liquid-crystal-on-silicon panel, resulting in a
display that is one-eighth the thickness of conventional displays.
This technology could enable lighter AR glasses and improve
smartphone, tablet, and television screens, although challenges such
as laser speckle and power efficiency remain. 

 ADOBE BRINGS GOOGLE GEMINI 2.5 FLASH IMAGE TO FIREFLY AND EXPRESS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe integrated Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model into Firefly
and Express, providing creators with enhanced image generation
capabilities and improved photo editing control. The company will
offer unlimited generations for subscribers through September 1, while
new free users receive up to 20 generations. Google's model includes
SynthID watermarking and content filtering, although it may produce
factually inaccurate details, such as imperfect faces or spelling
errors.

 SUCCESSIVE PROTOTYPES BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN IDEA AND REALITY (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ideas cannot be adequately evaluated through mental visualization or
persuasive arguments alone. They require physical prototypes to bridge
the gap between concept and reality. Verbal descriptions fail to
capture an idea's true potential, leading to decisions based on
persuasiveness rather than substance. Prototypes provide concrete,
testable manifestations that allow fair evaluation of ideas through
direct experience rather than abstract debate. 

 A WEEK IN THE LIFE OF AN AI-AUGMENTED DESIGNER (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A UX designer conducted an AI-augmented design sprint, using ChatGPT
and Figma Make to accelerate research synthesis, ideation, and
prototyping while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions.
The designer discovered AI's collaborative potential but found that
verification remained essential due to occasional hallucinations and
the omission of human nuances. The week-long experiment yielded a
validated concept of Gen Z financial literacy and a framework for
integrating responsible AI into design workflows. 

 APPLE'S 3-YEAR DESIGN PLAN JUST GOT ME EXCITED ABOUT THE IPHONE AGAIN
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple, long criticized for incremental iPhone updates and a lack of
innovation, is rumored to be preparing a dramatic redesign cycle over
the next three years. Reports suggest the iPhone 17 Air—its thinnest
model yet—will debut next month, followed by a foldable iPhone in
2026, and culminating in 2027 with the iPhone 20, which will feature a
seamless curved-glass design to mark the device's 20th anniversary.

 THE DESIGNER'S GUIDE TO LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designers must understand LLMs beyond prompt writing to create better
user experiences through three integration levels: Feature-Level
(helpful additions), Agent-Level (active participation), and
Platform-Level (autonomous orchestration). Current AI interfaces
suffer from a technology-first mindset and design homogeneity.
However, successful solutions make AI invisible, focusing on user
goals rather than the underlying technology. The best approach
combines conversational capabilities with familiar interface patterns,
designing flexible frameworks that embrace uncertainty rather than
rigid user flows. 

 DESIGN AS A POLITICAL SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The US National Design Studio and "America by Design" initiative
represent a shift from liberal capitalism to neo-mercantile
governance, recasting citizens as guests in a national hospitality
experience. The initiative employs aesthetic design to garner
allegiance and legitimize administrative control, rather than
empowering users, treating design as an infrastructure for state
authority. Without built-in provenance and recourse mechanisms, this
approach risks using beautiful interfaces to launder bureaucratic
violence and restrict citizen agency through "friendly fascism."
