 WHATSAPP ON WINDOWS 11 GETS A NEW ADAPTIVE UI, MULTI-WINDOW, AND
NAVIGATION MENU (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 WhatsApp for Windows 11 has received a significant update that
introduces an adaptive UI that optimizes screen space, multi-window
support akin to Telegram, and a new hamburger menu for streamlined
navigation. The adaptive interface now prioritizes chat readability by
separating the contacts list from the chat window. The multi-window
feature allows users to open chats in separate windows, enhancing
multitasking. The new menu potentially sets the stage for Meta AI
integration, streamlining access to features like chats, statuses, and
settings.

 In a recent press tour for his brand Sun Day Red, Tiger Woods

Despite the strong language, Woods sees this as an opportunity for the
logo's evolution, hinting at potential modifications with future
victories. His departure from Nike and the launch of his independent
brand signal a new era for Woods, where he takes control of his
branding and image.

 IS ‚åò + C THE NEW DESIGN PROCESS? (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Designers often preach passion and craft, not profit. They started
this journey for the love of art - to create beautiful things and make
products and services people would use and love. It's up to them to
change how design is perceived. Designers need to articulate and
evangelize the value of design and its impact on business.

 NOTES ON QUALITY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Improving design quality is as simple as setting clear standards,
empowering teams to meet them, and fostering a culture of shared
ownership and rigorous critique. Quality in design, experienced
through usability and aesthetics, can be maintained by aligning with
stakeholders as benchmarks and involving the entire UX team in quality
assurance. 

 DESIGNING FOR CHANGE: UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIOR CHANGE THEORY (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Many apps fail to change human behavior in the long term because they
lack a deep understanding of human psychology. In addition to
cognitive biases, psychology offers many other insights that can be
applied to design thinking. Frameworks like the Theory of Planned
Behavior, the Transtheoretical Model, and Self-Determination Theory
provide a solid foundation for designers wanting to help users change
their habits and behaviors. 

 WHAT TO DO IF YOUR UX TEAM IS UNDER-RESOURCED (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 UX teams, which are typically under-resourced, should shift from
merely implementing best practices to becoming evangelists and
facilitators, teaching and providing tools for UX work. By advocating
the business value of UX, including enhanced user satisfaction, teams
can justify resource investments, possibly with support from external
consultants.
