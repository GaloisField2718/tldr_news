NEWS & TRENDS

 TRANSFORM YOUR PHOTOS INTO VIDEOS AND REMIX YOUR PICS IN GOOGLE
PHOTOS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google Photos announced new creative tools that transform static
images into six-second videos and artistic remixes using AI
technology. The photo-to-video feature, powered by Veo 2, rolls out
today, while Remix transforms pictures into anime and comic styles. A
new Create tab, arriving in August, will centralize all creative
features, including safety measures such as digital watermarks. 

 BUILD WITH YOUR TEAM, NOT AROUND THEM: REAL-TIME COLLABORATION IN
WEBFLOW IS HERE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Webflow has launched real-time collaboration in private beta,
enabling entire website teams, including designers, developers, and
marketers to work simultaneously on the same page without handoffs or
delays. This feature streamlines workflows, reduces bottlenecks, and
enables faster, more integrated project delivery, with updates syncing
instantly and providing visibility into who is working on what. 

 META'S NEURAL INTERFACE WRISTBAND READS YOUR MUSCLE SIGNALS TO
CONTROL COMPUTERS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has developed a neural interface wristband that utilizes surface
electromyography to detect electrical signals from muscle movements,
enabling users to control computers without physical contact. This
breakthrough challenges traditional wearable design by eliminating
setup friction, enhancing accessibility, and introducing new
interaction models that could influence the future of AR, computing,
and health tech.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 PROTECT YOUR CREATIVITY FROM IDEA KILLERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 "Idea killers" are statements that prevent organizational change
despite often containing poor logic. Common examples include "we tried
that before" and "we don't do that here," typically said by those in
positions of power. The solution involves preparing counterarguments
and asking questions to examine the value of ideas rather than
allowing dismissive statements. 

 A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR SHARED DESIGN LEADERSHIP (9 MINUTE READ) [8]


 A Design Manager and a Lead Designer may approach the same problem
from different angles—people and psychology vs. craft and
execution—but both are essential parts of a healthy, high-performing
design team. By embracing their overlapping responsibilities and
aligning around shared goals across three “systems” (nervous,
muscular, and circulatory), they can create a resilient, strategically
aligned team that produces excellent, sustainable design work. 

 HOW TO SELL THE EUROPEAN ACCESSIBILITY ACT TO YOUR BOSS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 As of June 28, the European Accessibility Act (EAA) made it legally
mandatory for businesses selling in the EU to meet accessibility
standards—or risk hefty fines from multiple member states. Beyond
legal compliance, accessibility improves user experience, expands your
potential customer base, and enhances product quality for everyone,
making it a smart business decision, not just a moral one.

 THE PRODUCT TRIAD: DESIGN'S ROLE (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The product triad organizes Agile product teams with one
representative each from design, product management, and engineering
working as equal partners. Based on IDEO's Desirable-Viable-Feasible
framework, effective triads collaborate across all three aspects
rather than maintaining siloed ownership. Designers contribute beyond
just desirability by understanding business objectives, conducting
user research, and collaborating closely with engineering to ensure
feasible implementation.
