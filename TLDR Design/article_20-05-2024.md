NEWS & TRENDS

 SAMSUNG SHADES APPLE WITH 'CREATIVITY CANNOT BE CRUSHED' AD AFTER
IPAD PROMO BACKLASH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Samsung capitalized on Apple's controversial iPad Pro ad with a new
campaign for the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra. Apple's ad, which featured a
hydraulic press crushing artistic tools, sparked debate that made the
company decide not to run it on TV. In Samsung's response, a woman
picks up a visibly damaged guitar at a location reminiscent of the
Apple commercial and begins creating music using her tablet as a
creativity ally. 

 THIS IS WHAT GOOGLE MAPS' BIG REDESIGN LOOKS LIKE (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Google Maps' redesign introduces a cleaner home screen, a simplified
bottom navigation bar, a redesigned search field, and new pin colors.
The new sheet-based interface allows users to interact with things on
the map without taking over the whole screen. Switching between tabs
will be less frequent as the map is visible using different app
functions. The updated version improves the placement of transport
options at the bottom of the screen and features a new arrival card
design. 

 "BRING THE BLUE BACK": WHATSAPP ANNOUNCES APP REDESIGN, NOT EVERYONE
IS PLEASED (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Whatsapp's new layout isn't a radical departure - search is more
prominent at the top of the app. Below it, tabs let you quickly access
unread messages and groups, and on the bottom, a row of icons lets
users access Chats, Updates, Communities, and other features. However,
WhatsApp users on iOS have noticed a significant visual change: the
predominant color accent on everything is now green instead of blue.

 DOES CHATGPT HAVE GOOD UX? (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT lacks UX standards and
has limited user guidance, unclear error messages, a lack of context
awareness, inconsistent output quality, and reduced transparency and
explainability. Solutions to address these issues include a clearer
and more intuitive user interface, better onboarding, integration of
fact-checking mechanisms, and exploring ways to incorporate context
awareness into prompting. Ensuring transparency and emphasizing user
control over the generated content are also essential for trust. 

 APPLE'S NEW AI-BASED ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES ARE PRETTY WILD (4 MINUTE
READ) [9]

recognition for atypical speech patterns. The Vision Pro headset will
also provide live captions for real-life conversations, demonstrating
Apple's commitment to inclusive design for a broader range of
conditions. 

 THE ONLY CONSTANT (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The transient nature of digital design means interfaces constantly
evolve, with original designs rarely remaining the same. The
inevitability of redesigns shifts the identity of digital artifacts,
much like Theseus' ship. This ongoing evolution highlights the
importance of integrity and taste in the designer's craft.
