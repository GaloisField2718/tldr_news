 OpenAI's upgraded image generator in ChatGPT has drawn over 130
million users and 700 million images since March 25, causing capacity
issues and product delays. Its viral Ghibli-style feature fueled
growth, especially in India, but also strained infrastructure. OpenAI
is working nonstop to meet the overwhelming demand.

 WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A DESIGNER AT 40 (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A 40-year-old UX designer reflects on the current state of the
industry, expressing concerns about its creative decline and the
overwhelming noise online. While acknowledging AI's potential to
simplify workflows, he emphasizes the enduring value of human
creativity and the need to stay curious and adaptable. 

 CURSOR, “VIBE CODING,” AND MANUS: THE UX REVOLUTION THAT AI NEEDS
(9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Current AI interfaces often rely on rigid "prompt engineering,"
requiring users to input specific phrases and formats to get accurate
results — a limitation rooted in design, not intelligence. To make
AI more accessible, there's a growing push for more intuitive
interactions, including tools like Cursor and casual, conversational
approaches like "vibe coding." 

 MAKE DESIGN FUN AGAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design often begins with playful curiosity—like building with Legos
or sketching for fun—before becoming a career. However, professional
demands can drain that joy. Designers need to reconnect with playful
creation, free from goals or judgment, and rediscover the pleasure of
making purely for themselves, not for work.

 THE GENERATIVE AI PROTOTYPE REVOLUTION: MY WEEKEND WITH LOVABLE.DEV
AND TULIPS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Generative AI lets designers prototype in hours, not days, automating
repetitive UI tasks and generating specs. It's a paradigm shift that
blends human insight with machine speed. While not production-ready,
it's ideal for ideation and early-stage design. Adaptation is key—AI
augments workflows, redefines collaboration, and elevates the
designer's role to the strategic architect. 

 ON CREATIVITY AS A PROCESS OF LAYERING (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Creativity is a collaborative process shaped by dialogue, memory, and
place. Multidisciplinary work blends music and writing into evolving
communal experiences. We must challenge dominant narratives, embrace
ambiguity, and value repetition as a resonance form. Creativity
emerges through curiosity, empathy, and lived experience.
