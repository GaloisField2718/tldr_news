 THE TINY TWEAK THAT COULD CHANGE YOUTUBE FOREVER (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 YouTube is testing an endless scrolling feature for full-length
videos to boost content discovery and audience growth for new
creators. This change may reduce creators' reliance on thumbnails and
titles as it shifts content selection to an autoplaying feed
controlled by the algorithm that potentially favors shorter, punchier
videos.

 WHY THE FUTURE OF PRODUCT DESIGN IS ALL ABOUT HOW IT FEELS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Tactile design involves using material, texture, and weight to create
richer, multisensory experiences. A counter to minimalistic digital
designs, this approach reconnects us with physical interactions,
boosting usability, emotional attachment, and accessibility. Brands
like ASUS and Google integrate tactile elements as a response to
consumers' desire for meaningful connections in a screen-dominated
world. 

 'COMIC SANS BELONGS IN A MUSEUM': DESIGNERS DEFEND THE WORLD'S MOST
DIVISIVE FONT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Comic Sans, a divisive font often used humorously, was designed 30
years ago for casual, accessible use. It is often mocked for its
appearance on homemade projects. Some designers argue that it deserves
more respect alongside traditional fonts like Garamond and Helvetica. 

 A GUIDE TO DESIGNING ERRORS FOR WORKFLOW AUTOMATION PLATFORMS (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designing effective error messages for workflow automation platforms
requires clarity, accessibility, and contextual help. Designers should
use color and iconography thoughtfully, position error messages near
the issue, offer actionable solutions, and adapt designs to different
users and error types. Prioritizing accessibility ensures that all
users, including those with disabilities, can navigate error
resolution processes effectively.
