NEWS & TRENDS

 FERRARI LOSES LOGO BATTLE AGAINST BIZARRE OPPONENT (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Ferrari lost a trademark dispute with Malaysian energy drink brand
Wee Power over the use of horse imagery in its logos. The High Court
ruled that Wee Power's design, which features two red horses facing
each other with a 'W' background, didn't infringe Ferrari's prancing
horse trademark. Ferrari was ordered to pay legal costs but has filed
an appeal at the KL High Court. 

 NEW GALAXY Z FOLD 7 LEAKS MAY GIVE FIRST REAL LOOK AT SAMSUNG'S
SLIMMER FOLDABLE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Leaked hands-on images of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 suggest a
noticeably slimmer and more refined design, with a chassis around
4.5mm thick when open, making it sleeker than its predecessor and more
competitive with rival foldables. The camera array has also been
redesigned. It now features slim silver rings, instead of the bulky
black ones on the Z Fold 6, and has a bold new “Blue Shadow”
color. An EU label leak indicates the device will retain similar
battery life. Full details are expected at Samsung's Unpacked event on
July 9th. 

 LOVABLE ON TRACK TO RAISE $150M AT $2B VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lovable, a fast-growing Swedish AI startup focused on building web
apps from text prompts, is reportedly raising over $150 million at a
near $2 billion valuation, just months after a $15 million pre-Series
A round. The company, founded in 2023, has quickly scaled to $50
million in annual recurring revenue within six months of launching its
product, drawing comparisons to competitors like Replit and Bolt.
Lovable recently launched a beta AI agent for automated code editing
and debugging, adopting a usage-based pricing model aligned with
industry trends and investor expectations.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 TRUSTNOMICS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Traditional marketing and storytelling have lost their effectiveness
as power has shifted from brands to consumers through the rise of
short-form video and creator culture. "Trustnomics" is a four-step
framework where trust becomes the essential currency for brand growth
in an era of indistinguishable real and AI content. This approach
emphasizes identifying key product moments, treating products as
content, building repeatable systems over scalable campaigns, and
operating through a trust-focused flywheel rather than traditional
marketing funnels. 

 DATA TABLE DESIGN BEST PRACTICES (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Data tables in enterprise applications require careful design to help
users scan, understand, and manipulate structured information
effectively. Key design practices include proper content alignment
(left for text, right for numbers, and center for icons), clear visual
contrast with bold headers and subtle row separators, and essential
functionality such as sorting, filtering, and pagination for large
datasets. Advanced features, including column resizing, show/hide
options, drag-and-drop reordering, hover states, bulk actions,
horizontal scrolling, proper link styling, and inline editing with
error handling, enhance usability and give users control over their
data viewing experience. 

 DESIGN IN A WORLD OF CHANGE: IS IT OUR TITLES THAT MATTER, OR IS IT
SOMETHING ELSE? (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The ongoing debate over design titles, reignited by Shopify's
decision to drop specialist roles, reflects a deeper issue: the design
community's tendency to create false dichotomies that fragment rather
than advance the discipline. In an era shaped by AI, the future of
design depends not on defending labels, but on embracing design as an
integrative, cross-disciplinary practice rooted in synthesis,
adaptability, and human-centered problem solving.

 I TRIED FIGMA MAKE — HERE'S WHAT IT GETS RIGHT (AND WHAT'S STILL
BROKEN) (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Figma Make is a generative AI tool that converts prompts and
screenshots into functional code aimed at streamlining
designer-developer workflows. Despite being buggy and limited in its
current state, the tool shows potential for enabling faster
prototyping, seamless handoffs, and allowing designers to fix minor
bugs themselves, though it currently makes unwanted design decisions
without user input. While AI integration may blur the lines between
design and development roles, designers must remain responsible for
final decisions and avoid the risk of design homogenization. 

 A RARE LOOK INSIDE THE DURABILITY LAB WHERE APPLE TORTURES ITS
PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple rigorously tests its devices across four
categories—environmental, water, impact, and vibration—to ensure
durability in real-world conditions. It runs thousands of trials,
including exposure to salt, sweat, and sand, as well as drops on
various surfaces and vibrations from motorcycles. Select attendees
toured Apple's testing labs during WWDC 2025, gaining insight into the
extreme simulations that iPhones and other products must pass, such as
submersion in water, soda exposure, and pressure testing for IP
certification.

 St Andrews Links, the historic "home of golf," has undergone a major

lifestyle brand and unlock new revenue streams through retail,
partnerships, and international expansion. With redesigned course

color palette drawn from the landscape, the rebrand aims to appeal to
