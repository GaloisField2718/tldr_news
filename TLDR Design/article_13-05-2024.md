READ) [7]

 SIMON CASE: AI WILL DESTROY JOBS, BUT THERE'S A SILVER LINING THAT
COULD SAVE YOUR CAREER (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The rapid advancement of AI in advertising and creative fields may
replace jobs, leading to a rise in "single-person, full-service
agencies" as AI automates tasks. However, strategic thinking and idea
generation will remain valued skills. AI's democratization of design
could create new opportunities. Learning AI platforms and strategic
skills will help young creatives to stay competitive. 

 HOW TO MAKE YOUR DESIGN STORIES FOCUSED ON YOUR USER'S PERSPECTIVE
(10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Design storytelling is needed. Your story must be told from the
user's perspective, and you must ensure your audience empathizes with
them, bringing the user perspective through the first-person
peripheral perspective. In design storytelling, the focus is not on
what you observed, but on what users experienced.

 I TOOK DAVID HAMILL'S UX CHALLENGE (HOW DID I DO?) (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The UX challenge seeks to improve the iPhone call screen by
addressing complexity and confusion through two design attempts. The
first attempt introduces "Ignore" and "Accept" options, each with two
sub-options, and the second attempt simplifies the design further,
removing the "Ignore" option. 

 METAPHOR AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE INTERFACE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Metaphors play a crucial role in interface design. They simplify
complex information, often borrowing from corporate contexts like the
"desktop" and "folders," and evolve over time, as seen with the
transformation of the "save" icon from its floppy disk origins. As
design grapples with managing complexity, future interfaces might
explore alternative sensory cues or spatial representations for
conveying meaning. 

 BOMBARDIER'S NEW LOGO IS PART OF A GROWING TREND: NAMING YOUR LOGO (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The new Bombardier logo, the "Mach," follows a naming trend.
Assigning a name can help shape a logo's meaning and control how it's
discussed, which is particularly important for abstract symbols that
might be interpreted differently. Naming a logo imbues it with an
identity and a sense of uniqueness.
