 CHROME IS GETTING 3 NEW GENERATIVE AI FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 These experimental AI features enable users to organize their tabs,
create custom themes, and get help writing on the web. Chrome users
can enable these experimental features in settings, but because these
features are early public experiments, they‚Äôll be disabled for
enterprise and educational accounts for now. 

 LUMIERE IS AN IMPRESSIVE NEW TEXT-TO-VIDEO AI FROM GOOGLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Lumiere is a new text-to-video diffusion model from Google AI that
creates realistic, diverse, and coherent motion in videos. Instead of
spatially distant keyframes followed by temporal super-resolution,
Lumiere's architecture generates the entire video duration in a single
pass, enhancing motion fluidity and coherence. Examples of early
animations show remarkably smooth camera movements and complex object
animations that span multiple seconds.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kittl raised another $36 million just a year after raising $11.6
million during a Series B round led by IVP and including some existing
investors. The startup intends to become the go-to tool for creating
logos through its built-in illustration library and collection of
copyright-free photos, t-shirt designs, cards, social media posts, and
other media. It recently added AI-based features like AI background
removal and image generation using Stability AI's and OpenAI's APIs as
well as its own in-house technology.

 WHY ADOBE IS FRUSTRATING WEB DESIGNERS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The demise of Flash was followed by the introduction of Muse, which

 HOW TO NAIL PRODUCT MARKET FIT WITH CLEAR JOBS-TO-BE-DONE (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Letterboxd is an app where users can keep track of movies they
watched, share their lists with friends, and discuss them, like a
social network on top of IMDB. The app needs to stand up to user
expectations because of a lack of focus on two main jobs to be done:
keeping track of watched movies and engaging socially with other
users. 

 THE COST OF PERSONALIZATION (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The ‚Äúpersonalization paradox‚Äù refers to the clash between
personalized experiences that save us time and concern about the
personal data they require. However, privacy isn‚Äôt the only
trade-off we make for the convenience of personalization. Personalized
content recommendations are engineered to keep users on platforms
longer and get users into a trance-like state. 

 WE NEED TO DESIGN FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOUR IF WE'RE EVER TO GET RID OF
SINGLE-USE PLASTICS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Businesses can reduce single-use plastics by designing reusable
packaging, but this has yet to be successful at scale. Consumer
motivation for environmentally friendly behavior is high, but we
shouldn't ignore people's tendency to prefer convenience, even when it
has tragic consequences. While you can't control what people do with
packaging once it leaves your premises, you can still influence them
by considering behavioral psychology in packaging design.
