 BUBBLE LAUNCHES AI AGENT TO MERGE CONVERSATIONAL CODING WITH VISUAL
APP BUILDING (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Bubble AI Agent combines conversational AI coding with visual
drag-and-drop editing to build production-grade applications,
addressing security and quality concerns that limit AI coding tool
adoption. The platform allows users to switch between natural language
prompts and visual editing with full control, targeting the 72% of
surveyed users worried about security vulnerabilities in AI-generated
code. To promote the launch, Bubble announced a $25,000 hackathon with
Anthropic and revealed upcoming features, including an AI-enhanced
Property Editor and mobile in-app purchase support. 

 TINTED GLASS: APPLE PREVIEWS LIQUID GLASS ALTERNATIVE IN NEW IOS BETA
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's iOS 26.1 beta 4 adds customization options for the Liquid
Glass interface, addressing complaints about its translucency. Users
can now choose between Clear and Tinted modes, making text and
notifications easier to read—an improvement driven by feedback from
beta testers and accessibility advocates. 

 YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE PAINT'S LATEST FEATURE IN WINDOWS 11 (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is adding a new generative AI feature called Restyle to
Paint in Windows 11, allowing users to transform images into different
art styles, such as Pop Art. Currently available to Windows Insiders,
Restyle integrates into the Copilot menu. It has drawn criticism from
users tired of AI being added across Windows, as it requires a
Microsoft account and is initially limited to Copilot+ PCs.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 CLAUDE FOR CODE: HOW TO USE CLAUDE TO STREAMLINE PRODUCT DESIGN
PROCESS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude excels at code-adjacent design tasks, making it valuable for
UI designers in three key areas. It can transform high-fidelity
mockups into HTML prototypes by processing screenshots, though the
preview may need browser verification for accuracy. It also
streamlines design system work by converting Figma component specs
into React components and transforming style guides into CSS variables
or Tailwind configs. Claude can generate micro-interactions and
animations, including Framer Motion snippets for effects like button
hover states and transitions. 

 THE DESIGN SPACE OF AI CODING TOOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A recent UC San Diego paper analyzed 90 AI coding assistants and
identified 10 design dimensions across four categories: user
interface, system inputs, capabilities, and outputs. The research
traces three evolutionary eras—autocomplete (2021-2022), chat
(2023-2024), and agents (2024-2025)—and revealed that industry
products converge on speed and polish while academic prototypes
explore novel interaction designs like multimodal inputs and
explainability features. The paper maps these design dimensions to six
user personas. It emphasizes that building these tools involves
fundamental trade-offs between control versus convenience, simplicity
versus capability, and access versus power. 

 FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON AI IS OVERSHADOWING THE FEAR OF LOSING OUR
HUMANITY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The focus around AI has shifted from fearing its impact to fearing
missing out on its benefits. This drive for convenience and efficiency
risks eroding human judgment, creativity, and the value of effort,
especially among younger generations who rely on AI to bypass learning
through struggle. As reliance grows, cultural standards decline, with
“good enough” work replacing true depth. While AI mirrors our
values, prioritizing speed over meaning could hollow out what makes us
human.

 THE EASIEST WAY TO CALCULATE ROI (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Value-based pricing becomes simpler when ROI is calculated after
project completion rather than predicted. The approach leverages
proven results from previous projects—such as clients achieving
$100K-$300K revenue increases from brand identity work—to
demonstrate value to new prospects. This method replaces uncertain
predictions with concrete past performance, making it easier to
justify higher prices and convince clients that similar results are
achievable for them. 

 FLOW STATE DESIGN: APPLYING GAME PSYCHOLOGY TO PRODUCTIVITY APPS (12
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Games excel at creating flow states through challenge-skill balance,
clear goals, and immediate feedback, while productivity tools
typically fail to engage users despite decades of research on flow
psychology. Current task managers remain "state-blind," unable to
recognize user context or adapt to energy levels, unlike games that
constantly track and respond to player states. By applying game design
principles, productivity apps can help users maintain flow states,
making work genuinely engaging rather than feeling like drudgery. 

 MACHINE LEARNING AND DESIGN THINKING ARE “BASICALLY” THE SAME (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Backpropagation in machine learning closely parallels design
thinking, as both rely on iterative improvement through feedback
loops. Each involves making an initial assumption, testing outcomes,
identifying and analyzing errors, refining the approach, and repeating
the process. Concepts such as bias, underfitting, and overfitting
translate naturally to design: bias reflects designer assumptions,
underfitting represents overly generic solutions, and overfitting
denotes designs too specific to controlled conditions. Both
disciplines emphasize gradual, continuous refinement — learning from
feedback to steadily improve outcomes.
