NEWS & TRENDS

 NEW ALPHA: PROMPT TO EDIT YOUR FIGMA DESIGNS (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Figma has launched an alpha feature that allows users to edit designs
through written prompts, enabling bulk edits, content additions,
resizing, and UI variations. The tool can redesign multiple frames
simultaneously, insert images and text, generate mobile versions, and
create new components from scratch. Access is limited to 5,000 users
on paid plans who apply for early testing. 

 KUO: APPLE TO LAUNCH TOUCH SCREEN MACS, STARTING WITH OLED MACBOOK
PRO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is planning to launch touch-screen Macs, beginning with an OLED
MacBook Pro expected to enter production in late 2026. This new model
will likely be powered by M6 chips and feature both OLED display
technology and touch capability, marking a major functional shift
toward iPad-like interaction. Apple may also extend touch support to
future MacBook Air models, reflecting broader trends in consumer
expectations for touch-enabled devices. 

 YOUTUBE UNVEILS NEW WAYS FOR CREATORS TO WARN WITH BRAND DEALS,
YOUTUBE SHOPPING PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube announced new monetization features at its Made on YouTube
event, including swappable brand sponsorship slots in long-form videos
and AI-powered product tagging that automatically displays tags when
products are mentioned. The platform is expanding its Shopping program
to more creators and markets, such as Brazil, and adding major
retailers, with gross merchandise volume growing 5x year-over-year.
YouTube also introduced brand links for Shorts creators and will
proactively suggest creator-brand partnerships through its hub in
Google Ads.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 IPHONE AIR REVIEW: THE THINNEST IPHONE EVER, BUT AT WHAT COST? (22
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The iPhone Air marks Apple's most radical iPhone redesign since the
iPhone X, delivering a record-thin 5.6 mm titanium body, light weight,
and a striking new “plateau” housing for its components. It pairs
the A19 Pro chip, new Apple-designed modem, and Wi-Fi 7 support with
strong durability upgrades, but compromises on cameras, offering only
a single 48MP main lens and no Telephoto or Ultra-Wide options. 

 WHY DESIGNING FOR USERS WHO DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM MATTERS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Problem-unaware users often fail to recognize issues with their
current workflows, instead viewing struggles as personal failings
rather than systemic problems that solutions could address. Designers
can help these users by surfacing problems through behavioral
triggers, social proof, and before-and-after comparisons that
demonstrate real-world benefits tied to specific scenarios.
Successfully converting problem-unaware audiences represents
significant growth potential since they typically constitute the
largest group of potential users for most products. 

 FUNCTIONAL PERSONAS WITH AI: A LEAN, PRACTICAL WORKFLOW (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Traditional demographic personas are ineffective for UX work, as they
focus on irrelevant details like age and income rather than user tasks
and goals. Functional personas center on what people are trying to
accomplish, their questions, pain points, and service gaps, using AI
to synthesize existing data like surveys and analytics. This
AI-assisted workflow enables teams to create lightweight, actionable
personas that directly inform design decisions and can be updated
regularly without extensive research cycles.

 ARTISTS ARE LOSING WORK, WAGES, AND HOPE AS BOSSES AND CLIENTS
EMBRACE AI (33 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Visual artists, illustrators, and graphic designers are experiencing
significant job losses as companies increasingly embrace AI-generated
imagery to cut costs. While AI output is often deemed "good enough" by
clients despite quality issues, it's leading to disappearing work
opportunities, lower wages, and declining demand for traditional
creative skills across industries, from advertising to entertainment.
The impact extends beyond just lost income, with many artists
reporting severe psychological distress from seeing their life's work
devalued and their artistic identity undermined. 

 VOICE AND IMMERSIVE INTERFACES: PREPARING YOUR PRODUCT FOR THE FUTURE
OF UX (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Voice and immersive interfaces are transitioning from novelty
features to operational necessities, with major organizations like NHS
trusts, Tesla, and Boeing already implementing them to enhance
productivity and user experience. These technologies excel where
traditional interfaces struggle, enabling hands-free interaction,
improving accessibility for users with disabilities, and providing
spatial understanding for complex tasks. Companies should audit their
most common user actions for voice potential and adopt voice-first
thinking, as users increasingly expect more intuitive, contextual, and
human-like digital interactions.
