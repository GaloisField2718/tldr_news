 APPLE MADE AN AI IMAGE TOOL THAT LETS YOU MAKE EDITS BY DESCRIBING
THEM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In collaboration with the University of California, Santa Barbara,
Apple researchers have developed the MGIE model, which enables users
to describe desired photo edits through text rather than directly
using photo editing software. MGIE, which stands for MLLM-Guided Image
Editing, performs tasks like cropping, resizing, and adding filters
based on textual prompts. It combines multimodal language models to
interpret user instructions and generate corresponding image edits,
enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in photo editing tasks. 

 SNAP IS LOOKING TO UNIFY USER EXPERIENCE ACROSS SPOTLIGHT AND STORIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [6]

including unifying Stories and Spotlight experiences. The update will
enhance ad interactions across platforms and increase engagement and
user growth. To improve engagement even further, the company plans to
migrate ranking mechanisms and recommendation engines from
TikTok-rival Spotlight to Stories, merging the interface and
navigational gaps between these two segments. 

 APPLE VISION PRO: EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE APPLE DESIGN TEAM (10
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Richard Howarth, VP of Industrial Design at Apple, and Alan Dye, VP
of Human Interface Design, explains how hardware and software worked
in unprecedented ways to transform ideas into reality during the
development of the Vision Pro. The tech giant's design team understood
that the device was a tool for connecting people, bringing them
together, and enriching their lives. The Vision Pro needed to feel not
too techy, so Apple invested a lot in flexible, soft materials and
designed natural and comfortable gestures. Its hardware and software
work together symbiotically, sharing common design principles and
high-level goals.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 MOBILE SEARCH: WHICH PATTERN SHOULD YOU CHOOSE? (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers should consider five principles when designing search
experiences on mobile devices: the entry point, the breadth of search
results, the presentation method, the complexity of search results,
and the complexity of the input fields. 

 UNINTENDED DESIGN CONSEQUENCES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In a world where innovation is driven primarily by speed, many
designs can have unintended negative consequences. Despite their noble
intentions, when Toms Shoes pledged to donate a pair of shoes for
every pair it sold, it put local shoemakers out of business. Designers
are responsible for the intended and unintended consequences of their
work. The only way to do that is to step back and explore all sides of
our big ideas.
