 PINTEREST SAYS ITS AI-POWERED COLLAGES ARE NOW MORE ENGAGING THAN
PINS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Using Pinterest's Shuffle feature, users can combine images and
photos to create collages. The company says its latest version,
powered by AI and computer vision, gets three times as much engagement
as traditional Pins. With the new format, users can curate content
from the web and Pinterest, but they can also snap pictures with their
phones to express their tastes, interests, and styles. 

 THE ARC BROWSER ARRIVES ON WINDOWS TO TAKE ON CHROME AND EDGE (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Arc browser, which has impressed macOS and iOS users over the
past couple of years, has finally made its way to Windows. The Browser
Company, the company behind Arc, is betting that its browser features,
like the collapsible sidebar, vertical tabs, app switcher-like
experience, and a command bar, are different enough to entice Windows
users away from Chrome and Edge.

 HOW WE CREATED A MULTI-BRAND DESIGN SYSTEM IN FIGMA (9 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 SnappOS offers white-label infotainment systems for automakers who
need more time and expertise to develop their own. Each carmaker has
its own branding, features, and hardware setup. In this article, Snapp
Automotive describes how it created a theming engine that can handle
multiple levels of customization, enabling it to scale to tens of
different brands without branching out. 

 AN UPDATED PRIMER ON ANDROID NAVIGATION (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers should build navigation based on tasks and content. The
navigation bar is convenient for jumping between primary destinations
but should only be used on compact screens. The navigation rail is
positioned on the side of the screen and should be used on medium and
expanded screens. 

 BEYOND ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù‚Äî PRIORITIZING QUALITY IN PRODUCT EXPERIENCES (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While most product teams strive to deliver products that meet or
exceed user expectations, they need more time and resources to perfect
every part of the user experience. The number of epics in a release
cycle is often prioritized over quality. This approach fails to define
and aim for the quality of the experience, resulting in products that
meet requirements but fail to delight customers. Through Experience
Quality Acceptance Criteria, teams can prioritize epics based on their
potential impact on user adoption and satisfaction instead of just
their feasibility.

 MAKING PRODUCT VALUE OBVIOUS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The most valuable contribution product designers can make to software
is making the core value of a product clear to the people using it.
Teams working on a product understand their product's value, but
outsiders may not. Being more straightforward is often necessary. 

 THE MUSEUM OF WEST AFRICAN ART (MOWAA) GETS A REBRAND THAT AMPLIFIES
THE REGION'S HERITAGE AND CONTEMPORARY ART (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 With a logo inspired by the museum's site plans, a colorway that
reflects Benin City's landscape, and an identity that boasts its
far-reaching collection, MOWAA's rebranding helps to connect West
Africa's budding cultural hub to the world. Regarding the color
palette, the natural environment comes through earth tones and
yellows, and documentation of the assets is taken against the backdrop
of the outdoors. 

 COMPOSABILITY IN DESIGN SYSTEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 People tend to prefer and use design systems that encourage mixing
and matching. Too much coverage can turn a design system into a
bureaucratic hurdle instead of a helpful tool. Instead of enforcing
recipes too soon, you should think of your design system as a library
of ingredients, consistent but flexible enough to accommodate
creativity and innovation.
