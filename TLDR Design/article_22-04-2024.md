 WHY PORTUGAL'S CONTROVERSIAL LOGO REVERSAL IS SAD NEWS FOR GRAPHIC
DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Among the first measures of Portugal's new prime minister, Lu√≠s

highly simplistic logo. Eduardo Aires, the designer behind the
redesigned logo, thinks the backlash is more about politics becoming
polarized, as the logo was used as a "projectile weapon" before last
month's general election.
