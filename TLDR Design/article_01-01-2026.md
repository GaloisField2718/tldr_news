NEWS & TRENDS

 THE EDISON AGENCY REFINES KETTLE CHIPS PACKAGING TO RESTORE PREMIUM
LEADERSHIP (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Kettle refreshed its packaging through careful refinement rather than
reinvention, modernizing craft cues, strengthening premium signals,
and creating a cohesive, future-proof system while preserving its
trusted, artisan DNA. The result was stronger shelf appeal, clearer
navigation, improved premium perception, and renewed cultural
relevance that reaffirmed Kettle's leadership in premium snacking. 

 QWEN3-TTS STEPS UP: VOICE CLONING AND VOICE DESIGN (22 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The Qwen3-TTS family introduces two new models: Qwen3-TTS-VD-Flash
for voice design via natural language instructions that control
timbre, prosody, and emotion, and Qwen3-TTS-VC-Flash for 3-second
voice cloning across 10 languages. Both models deliver highly
expressive, humanlike speech with robust text parsing capabilities and
automatic tone adjustments based on semantic content. Performance
benchmarks show Qwen3-TTS-VD-Flash outperforming GPT-4o-mini-tts and
Mimo-audio-7b-instruct on InstructTTS-Eval, while Qwen3-TTS-VC-Flash
achieves lower word error rates than MiniMax, ElevenLabs, and
GPT-4o-Audio-Preview.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 DESIGN LEADERS NEED TO JAM WITH THEIR TEAMS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Design has lost its apprenticeship model by pushing leaders to stay
“strategic” and out of craft, leaving junior designers without
opportunities to learn by working alongside experienced practitioners.
Hands-on collaboration—close to the work but not controlling—is
essential for teaching craft, growing talent, and restoring design
quality. 

 DESIGN TOKENS FOR DESIGNERS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design tokens standardize design properties such as color,
typography, and spacing by using named placeholders that both
designers and developers reference, ensuring consistency and
eliminating miscommunication across teams. They improve workflows by
enabling scalability as products grow, reducing manual updates when
changes occur, and maintaining visual consistency that strengthens
brand identity. To implement them effectively, identify recurring
design patterns, create semantic naming conventions, store tokens
centrally, and regularly update documentation to keep teams aligned.

 HOW TO DESIGN FOR (AND WITH) DEAF PEOPLE (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Deafness is a broad spectrum rather than a single condition. Common
assumptions about deaf people, sign language, and communication often
lead to exclusionary design decisions. Better UX comes from respectful
language, multiple communication modes (text, captions, haptics, and
visuals), and designing with deaf and hard-of-hearing people.
Accessibility is a deliberate, values-driven choice that benefits
everyone. 

 THESE LOGO DESIGN TRENDS WILL DEFINE 2026 (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Logo design is moving away from rigid, minimal wordmarks toward
flexible, responsive, and expressive identity systems that feel
playful, dimensional, and human, adapting across contexts, screens,
and physical spaces. Looking to 2026, the strongest logos will balance
subtle evolution with warmth, tactility, and cultural meaning, helping
brands signal belief, belonging, and authenticity in an increasingly
fragmented, AI-driven world. 

 WHAT DRIBBBLE DOESN'T TEACH YOU ABOUT REAL DESIGN WORK (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Dribbble showcases polished portfolio designs optimized for visual
impact, but these pixel-perfect screenshots often fail to address real
production challenges, such as variable content lengths, empty states,
and technical constraints. The platform's shift from sharing
work-in-progress to posting finished screens has created a gap in
design education, as designers learn to design for ideal conditions
rather than worst-case scenarios and sequential user flows. True
design proficiency comes from studying shipped products and pattern
libraries, and from building real interfaces that must handle the
messy edge cases portfolio sites never display. 

 PHOTOSHOP 1.0 AND THE LANDSCAPE OF POSSIBILITIES (9 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Photoshop 1.0, written by one person in the late 1980s, exemplifies
how transformative software emerges when new technologies create
unexplored "landscapes of possibility" that small teams navigate
through experimentation rather than grand planning. Paradigm shifts in
computing weren't predicted by visionaries but discovered
incrementally by people constrained by previous paradigms. Generative
AI represents a similar inflection point today, where current
implementations like chatbots and coding assistants may soon seem as
quaint as DOS interfaces, and somewhere, someone is likely building
the equivalent of Photoshop 1.0 for this new era.

 FANS WON'T LET THE STRANGER THINGS 5 LOGO BLUNDER GO (2 MINUTE READ)
[18]

Stranger Things 5 episode 7, a glaring anachronism, since the brand
wasn't founded until 1996—nine years after the scene's 1987 setting.
