NEWS & TRENDS

 YOUTUBE SHORTS IS ADDING AN IMAGE-TO-VIDEO AI TOOL, NEW AI EFFECTS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube is launching new generative AI features for Shorts creators,
including an image-to-video tool that transforms static photos into
six-second videos, as well as new AI effects for artistic
transformations. The image-to-video feature, powered by Google's Veo 2
model, is rolling out this week in the US, Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand, with broader availability planned for later. YouTube also
introduced AI Playground as a central hub for generative AI creation
tools, accessible through the Create button for users in the same
initial markets. 

 PROMPT, PROTOTYPE, PERFECT: FIGMA MAKE IS NOW AVAILABLE TO ALL USERS
(8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma Make has moved out of beta and is now available to all users
alongside other Figma AI features. The tool enables designers, product
managers, and engineers to rapidly create high-fidelity prototypes,
regardless of their technical background, thereby democratizing
prototyping and improving cross-functional collaboration. Teams at
Figma report that Make helps them explore ideas faster, align on
product decisions more effectively, and reduce iteration cycles
between design and development. 

 IOS 26 PUBLIC BETA NOW AVAILABLE WITH NEW DESIGN AND MORE (17 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 iOS 26 marks a major shift in Apple's software naming strategy,
aligning version numbers across platforms with the calendar year, and
introduces a sweeping visual overhaul called Liquid Glass, which
features dynamic, glass-like UI elements and fluid animations.
Alongside this redesign, iOS 26 revamps the Phone app with a unified
layout, Call Screening to filter unknown calls, and Hold Assist to
detect when someone returns to the line—enhancing both aesthetics
and usability.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 AI NEEDS UI (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI makes good UI more critical than ever. Visual interfaces often
outperform text-only interactions in efficiency, accessibility, and
user comprehension across various contexts. The most successful AI
implementations integrate into existing UIs rather than replacing them
with conversational interfaces, creating AI-augmented experiences. 

 UNDERSTANDING HOW TO TALK WITH EXECUTIVES IS A REQUIRED DESIGN SKILL
(6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Designers frequently struggle to communicate effectively with
executives, often losing their attention during meetings and failing
to demonstrate business impact. Key strategies include keeping
presentations concise, translating UX metrics into business terms that
are scalable, and leveraging data visualization to enhance clarity.
Effective executive communication has become a required design skill
for career advancement and gaining approval for design ideas. 

 VANILLA MOMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A quirky story about a car failing to start after buying vanilla ice
cream illustrates a deeper truth: small, real-world
behaviours—“vanilla moments”—can expose hidden flaws in even
the best-designed systems. These moments highlight the value of
observation over theory. Designers should approach their work with
humility, curiosity, and a commitment to learning from how people
actually interact with products in everyday life.

 THE HIDDEN COST OF POOR NAVIGATION: HOW INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
DIRECTLY IMPACTS BUSINESS METRICS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Poor website information architecture creates hidden business costs
through lost revenue, increased support tickets, and users abandoning
tasks when navigation fails. Companies like Wayfair increased category
page views by 23% and conversions by 15% simply by restructuring
navigation to match user expectations. Effective information
architecture requires aligning the website structure with users'
mental models through card sorting and user journey mapping, rather
than relying on internal organization. 

 TINY SCREENS, BIG IMPACT: THE FORGOTTEN ART OF DEVELOPING WEB APPS
FOR FEATURE PHONES (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Despite common assumptions, flip phones, which can now feature 4G,
WiFi, and app capabilities, remain significant, with over 200 million
non-smartphones sold annually. Developers can tap into this
underserved market through organic growth opportunities while adapting
designs for small screens and keyboard navigation. Modern remote
browser technologies, such as Cloud Phone and KaiOS, make building web
apps for these devices easier than ever before.
