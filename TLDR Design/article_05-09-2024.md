READ) [4]

 TO BE A DESIGNER IS TO BE A FACILITATOR (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Designers should embrace facilitation as a core principle, not just
an event-specific role. This involves supporting others to understand,
collaborate, and create by building shared understanding, promoting
open communication, and being mindful of power dynamics. Emphasizing
facilitation encourages inclusive, community-driven approaches rather
than reinforcing the outdated "designer as expert" model.
