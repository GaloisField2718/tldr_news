NEWS & TRENDS

 MICROSOFT IS REDESIGNING WINDOWS 11'S CONTEXT MENU (1 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Microsoft is redesigning Windows 11's right-click context menu after
four years of user complaints about clutter, introducing a "Split
Context Menu" that organizes options into context-aware nested
sections based on file type. The new design reduces menu length by up
to 38% and features a modern semi-transparent "Acrylic" appearance. No
release date has been announced. Showcased during the WinUI Community
Call, the update groups related actions together—like image options
under "Open with Photos"—with secondary menus appearing on hover. 

 IPHONE AIR 2 IS DELAYED UNTIL 2027 SO APPLE CAN ADD A SECOND CAMERA
TO IT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has reportedly pushed the iPhone Air 2 from fall 2026 to a
tentative spring 2027 release as it redesigns the device—most
notably to add a second rear camera—though that target may still
slip. The current model's weak sales prompted the overhaul, but the
change is complex because iPhone designs are typically finalized about
two years before release. 

 THE IMPORTANT REASON BEHIND DORITOS' NEW MINIMALIST PACKAGING (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Frito-Lay's minimalist Simply NKD Cheetos and Doritos show how
packaging can manipulate perception—using stripped-back design to
signal health, purity, and moral superiority even when the product
itself is only slightly modified. The line illustrates how
“healthwashed” minimalism convinces consumers they're making a
healthier choice, highlighting the persuasive power of packaging in
shaping belief and behaviour.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHEN HUMANS ADD NEGATIVE VALUE: AI ALONE VS. HUMAN–AI SYNERGY (42
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Research shows that in many analytical tasks, human involvement now
degrades AI performance because people introduce bias and error when
overriding superior AI systems. While creative domains still benefit
from human-AI collaboration, with AI generating options and humans
providing judgment, this synergy window is narrowing as AI continues
to improve. The future requires humans to focus on strategic agency
and goal-setting, rather than interfering with AI's execution. 

 STRATEGY-TO-PIXELS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Modern strategy has compressed from quarterly planning to daily
decision-making, requiring practitioners to maintain hands-on craft
while expanding their influence across entire systems. True strategic
work means scaling one's craft through ownership and
agency—understanding dependencies, architectural decisions, and
cross-team impacts—rather than stepping away from execution into
purely advisory roles. The shift favors those who can fluidly move
between strategic thinking and actual building, proving concepts
through prototypes and demos rather than lengthy documents. 

 MAX OTTIGNON: AI IS SO HYPED, DESIGNERS PRETEND TO USE IT MORE THAN
THEY ACTUALLY DO (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI is being overhyped in branding, with some designers and companies
pretending to use it, but the real issue is that branding has become
generic—and AI risks amplifying sameness unless it's used to amplify
ideas, craft, and difference rather than efficiency. Agencies should
focus on quality, start with strong ideas, embrace experimentation,
and fight apathy, because while AI can make good designers better, it
cannot replace the deep, distinctive thinking required to build
memorable brands.

 USING DESIGN TOKENS AS VARIABLES: BEST PRACTICES (8 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Design tokens differ from code variables in that they function as
cross-platform design decisions with semantic meaning, requiring
rigorous naming strategies, clear governance, and automated
synchronization between design and code. This article demonstrates how
to implement tokens in Figma Variables, CSS Custom Properties, and
Sass. Advanced considerations include versioning tokens as APIs,
incorporating accessibility checks into pipelines, structuring tokens
into three layers (primitives, semantic aliases, and component slots),
and establishing release workflows. 

 HOW VISUAL CONSISTENCY BUILDS CLIENT TRUST ACROSS EVERY TOUCHPOINT (6
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Visual consistency across all client touchpoints builds trust by
creating familiarity and signaling professionalism, making clients
perceive brands as more reliable and credible. Design cohesion
requires integrated systems spanning digital platforms, communication
tools, and repeated content templates to maintain unified visual tone
and emotional signature throughout every interaction. When brands
deliver seamless visual experiences that feel intentional at every
stage, they transform design into a trust-building asset that
increases client loyalty, referrals, and perceived value over time. 

 FROM DESIGN TO DIRECTION: BRIDGING PRODUCT DESIGN AND AI THINKING (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Product design is evolving from arranging interfaces to orchestrating
systems of learning, where concepts from AI, like data, loss,
gradients, and training mirror how designers already iterate, reduce
friction, and optimize user journeys. As generative systems
increasingly shape interfaces, designers shift from controlling every
pixel to guiding intent, feedback loops, and signals across product,
experience, and business layers, making design less about screens and
more about system-level optimisation.
