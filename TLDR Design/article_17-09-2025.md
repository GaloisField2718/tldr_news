 IT'S DANGEROUS TO SEE THE ‘BUSINESS' AND ‘CREATIVE' WORK AS
SEPARATE SILOS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Creativity and business knowledge shouldn't be treated as separate
silos. The most effective work comes from understanding business
priorities, data, and strategy while applying creative thinking.
Embedding creative teams within businesses fosters collaboration,
ensuring solutions are both imaginative and aligned with measurable
impact. 

 THE ART OF INVISIBLE AI: WHAT GRANOLA'S 70% RETENTION TEACHES US
ABOUT PRODUCT DESIGN (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Granola, a London-based meeting notes app, achieved 70% weekly user
retention by pioneering an "invisible AI" that enhances rather than
replaces human note-taking. The app lets users take their own notes
during meetings, then uses AI to transform rough notes into organized
summaries without intrusive meeting bots or clunky interfaces.
Granola's success demonstrates that the most effective AI products
seamlessly integrate into existing workflows, building trust through
transparency and becoming more valuable over time as they accumulate
user context. 

 ACCESSIBLE DESIGN IN FIGMA: THE TOP 5 SKILLS FOR UX AND UI DESIGNERS
(11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UX and UI designers need five essential Figma skills for accessible
design: Auto Layout for responsive layouts, advanced prototyping for
keyboard navigation, plugin-powered accessibility auditing, built-in
testing tools, and AI prompt crafting. These skills help designers
create inclusive products by default while leveraging AI to streamline
workflows and catch accessibility issues early. The guide emphasizes
building accessibility into design workflows from the start rather
than treating it as an afterthought, especially with regulations like
the European Accessibility Act making inclusive design legally
required.

 FIGMA MAKE: THE BIGGEST SHIFT IN UX/UI SINCE SKETCH (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Figma Make, launched in 2025, transforms Figma from a design tool
into a full design-to-production platform by enabling designers to
generate functional, code-ready prototypes directly from their
designs. Building on the legacy of tools like Sketch and Zeplin, it
lets designers create, iterate, and test apps—including PWAs—using
AI-powered front-end coding, eliminating traditional handoff friction,
speeding up workflow, and making real-time user testing possible
without developers. 

 NEW IOS 26 ICONS: HERE'S HOW ALL THE NEW APP ICONS LOOK ON YOUR
IPHONE HOME SCREEN (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 iOS 26's Liquid Glass redesign not only updates system components but
also reimagines all app icons for the first time since iOS 7, unifying
their appearance across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS. Icons now
share consistent shapes, glass-layer effects, and alignment
guidelines, with subtle motion-responsive lighting, resulting in a
cleaner, more cohesive, and visually appealing home screen. 

 FREE ASSOCIATION: PRODUCTION DESIGNER JEREMY HINDLE ON BUILDING
SEVERANCE (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Emmy-winning production designer Jeremy Hindle transformed a sparse
script description of "four desks, large room" into Lumon Industries'
unsettling corporate world. Drawing from Jacques Tati's "Playtime,"
Eero Saarinen's architecture, and Dieter Rams' furniture, he created
an atmosphere described as "stunning and lonely." His design
philosophy focuses on crafting emotion through kinetic rather than
cerebral responses, using references from films like "Fargo" and "Twin
Peaks" to build Severance's uncanny aesthetic.
