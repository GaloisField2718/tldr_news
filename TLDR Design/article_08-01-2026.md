NEWS & TRENDS

 LEAKER SUGGESTS FUTURE IPHONES COULD GET MULTISPECTRAL CAMERAS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A reliable leaker claims Apple is exploring multispectral camera
sensors, a technology that captures infrared and ultraviolet light
alongside visible colors to potentially improve color accuracy and
low-light performance, for future iPhones. However, similar
implementations in Huawei phones delivered underwhelming results, and
given Apple's early, non-committal interest, it's unlikely the feature
will reach consumer iPhones anytime soon. 

 APPLE DESIGNER BEHIND IPHONE AIR IS JOINING THE AI STARTUP HARK (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Abidur Chowdhury, a former Apple designer who worked on the iPhone
Air, is joining AI startup Hark as head of design. Hark, founded and
self-funded with $100 million by Brett Adcock (who also runs robotics
startup Figure AI), has recruited 30 engineers from companies like
Google, Meta, and Amazon, aiming to reach 100 employees by mid-2026.
The startup is developing AI models with its first release planned for
summer 2026. 

 LEGO SMART BRICKS INTRODUCE A NEW WAY TO BUILD — AND THEY DON'T
REQUIRE SCREENS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Lego Smart Play system introduces interactive Smart Bricks, Tags,
and Minifigures that respond with lights, sounds, and motion sensing
without requiring screens. Powered by a tiny custom chip and a secure
Bluetooth-based network, the system allows pieces to recognize nearby
tags and each other, enabling more dynamic, responsive play. Lego's
first Smart Play sets, revealed at CES 2026 and themed around Star
Wars, will launch on March 1 with animated builds like Luke's X-wing
and a larger throne room duel set.

 STOP APPLYING TO THE WRONG UX JOBS: A RESEARCH SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY
WORKS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most UX designers fail at job hunting because they apply to
mismatched roles using a "spray and pray" approach that no longer
works in today's competitive market. This article presents a
five-phase research system: audit readiness through tool fluency and
portfolio quality, target specific industries with tailored resumes,
research companies beyond job descriptions, strategically network, and
treat rejection as diagnostic data rather than personal judgment. By
filtering opportunities rigorously and iterating on feedback,
designers can turn their job search from a numbers game into a precise
matching system that increases hiring success. 

 UX AND PRODUCT DESIGNER'S CAREER PATHS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Annual retrospectives and self-assessment tools help UX and product
designers clarify career goals beyond traditional management tracks.
The Mirror Model and career matrices identify strategic opportunities,
including sideways moves into specialized roles like AI experience
design or design-engineering translation. Designers should proactively
shape positions that amplify their strengths rather than fitting
predefined roles, focusing on human-centered work that AI cannot
replace. 

 WHAT YOUR UX CAREER'S FINGERPRINT REVEALS ABOUT REAL VALUE IN AN
AI-DRIVEN MARKET (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 As AI accelerates design execution, the real value of UX work
increasingly lies in human judgment and sensemaking: the upstream
effort of framing problems, reconciling constraints, and stabilising
direction before screens ever appear. This often-invisible work,
rarely named in job descriptions, is what enables coherent execution,
reduces costly reversals, and becomes even more critical as AI makes
output cheap but poor decisions more expensive.

 HOW TO REDUCE FRICTION IN REMOTE USABILITY STUDIES THROUGH BETTER
ASSET COLLECTION (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Remote usability testing frequently fails due to disorganized asset
preparation—scattered links, incomplete instructions, and mismatched
materials—rather than flawed design or complex tasks. Intentional
asset collection, including centralized storage, clear instructions,
standardized moderator preparation, and pilot testing, eliminates
friction and strengthens data quality. Key strategies involve creating
a single source of truth, writing unambiguous participant
instructions, anticipating technical variability, and selecting tools
that support rather than complicate workflows. 

 YOUNGER PEOPLE WANT GOOD DESIGN IN EVERY DRAWER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Younger generations expect everyday homeware to deliver flawless
performance, express personality, and adapt to their fluid,
budget-conscious lifestyles shaped by hybrid work and frequent moves.
Well-designed objects provide emotional support and self-expression,
transforming homes into curated spaces that serve as both sanctuary
and social backdrop. Brands must create durable, adaptable products
with emotional clarity that ground people through life's constant
changes rather than just looking attractive on shelves. 

 DELL, HP, AND LENOVO HEADED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO APPLE WITH
NEW LAPTOP DESIGNS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple is expected to unveil a thinner, redesigned MacBook Pro later
this year, continuing its long-standing push for sleekness despite
past trade-offs like lost ports, limited upgradability, and the failed
butterfly keyboard. In contrast, PC makers such as Dell, HP, and
Lenovo are moving toward thicker, more repairable laptops that
prioritise longevity and user-replaceable components over extreme
thinness.
