NEWS & TRENDS

 FIGMA ACQUIRES AI-POWERED MEDIA GENERATION COMPANY WEAVY (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Figma has acquired Tel Aviv–based AI image and video generation
startup Weavy, rebranding it as Figma Weave. The 20-person team will
join Figma. Weavy will remain a standalone product for now before
being integrated into Figma's platform. Founded in 2024 and backed by
$4 million in seed funding, Weavy's tools let designers combine
multiple AI models for advanced, node-based image and video generation
with detailed editing controls. 

 ADOBE LAUNCHES AI ASSISTANTS FOR EXPRESS AND PHOTOSHOP (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Adobe launched AI assistants for Express and Photoshop to help users
create and edit images more efficiently. Express features a dedicated
AI mode for text-based image generation that users can toggle with
traditional editing tools, while Photoshop's sidebar assistant can
understand layers, automate object selection, and handle repetitive
tasks like background removal. Adobe is also testing "Project
Moonlight," which coordinates multiple Adobe assistants and connects
to creators' social channels to understand their style. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES POMELLI, AN AI-POWERED TOOL THAT CREATES SOCIAL MEDIA
CAMPAIGNS AUTOMATICALLY (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's new AI tool, Pomelli, automatically generates complete
social media campaigns for small and midsize businesses by scanning
their websites to extract brand elements such as tone, colors, and
fonts. The system then suggests campaign ideas based on the extracted
brand profile, with content that can be edited in the interface and
downloaded. Google aims to reduce the time and cost of creating
marketing materials through this public beta, now available in the US,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand via Google Labs.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 THE AI CONCEPT THAT CHANGED OUR COMPANY'S WAY OF WORKING (7 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A Latin American HR startup has developed a "Product Playground"—a
local environment where non-engineers can rapidly build and test
functional product ideas using AI and their design system components.
This tool has shifted the design team's role from creating all
interfaces to maintaining infrastructure that enables company-wide
innovation, reducing idea-to-prototype cycles from weeks to hours. The
approach raises questions about traditional design workflows and
handoffs, but the company views it as a necessary evolution during
their "production acceleration stage." 

 ADOBE JUST PREVIEWED SOME OF THE WILDEST AI TOOLS WE'VE EVER SEEN (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Adobe showcased over ten experimental projects from its research team
at Adobe MAX 2025, highlighting major AI innovations. Standouts
included Project Motion Map, which animates static Illustrator images
via text prompts; Project Clean Take, which edits and replaces audio
directly from video transcripts; Project Light Touch, which adjusts
photo lighting and shadows after capture; and Project Frame Forward,
which applies edits from a single video frame to the entire clip using
AI. 

 MARKETING UX WITHIN YOUR ORGANIZATION (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Embedding UX into an organization requires internal marketing to
shift culture and build awareness. The approach focuses on creating a
network of UX ambassadors across departments through tools like
newsletters, discussion forums, and memorable internal PR stunts.
Regular newsletters should equip ambassadors with practical tips and
stories, while forums provide peer support. Other tactics include
internal conferences, short user-testing videos, and physical
reminders to keep UX visible. These low-cost, creative efforts help
spread user-centered thinking and build lasting organizational support
for UX.

 GENERATIVE UI AND EARLY THOUGHTS (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A generative UI approach allows large language models to dynamically
create interface structures at runtime based on real-time context and
user intent, rather than having designers hard-code every element in
advance. This probabilistic method enables interfaces to adapt
automatically to different users and situations without requiring
manual redesigns or new feature implementations for each scenario. The
shift represents a fundamental change from predicting every possible
use case upfront to letting systems respond contextually to user needs
as they arise. 

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR STARTUP'S FIRST DESIGN SYSTEM (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SpotAI developed its first Design System through a structured,
practical process suited for small teams. The process involved
creating a realistic moodboard, exploring visual styles in Figma,
rebuilding mockups with components, collaborating early with
engineers, using an open-source component library, building a detailed
Figma system tied to code, and maintaining it over time. The result
was a scalable, evolving system that streamlined design and
development while emphasizing simplicity, collaboration, and
continuous improvement. 

 THREE YEARS OF X: THE POWER (AND PERIL) OF RADICAL BRAND REINVENTION
(5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk's overhaul of Twitter into X shows how drastic, ego-led
rebrands can backfire when they ignore user connection and brand
heritage. The platform lost much of its community's loyalty and
recognition by discarding familiar identity elements and forcing a new
direction. Successful transformation should evolve gradually, be
grounded in purpose and audience understanding, and preserve what
people already value while guiding them forward. Reinvention works
only when it earns belief, not when it demands it.
