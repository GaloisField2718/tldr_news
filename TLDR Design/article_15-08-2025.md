NEWS & TRENDS

 TESLA'S GRAPHICS ARE ABOUT TO GET UNREAL (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Tesla's in-car visualizations for Autopilot and Full Self-Driving may
switch to Epic Games' Unreal Engine based on firmware evidence. Tesla
hacker greentheonly discovered signs of this change in the 2025.20
firmware for Model S and X vehicles with AMD chips. Other automakers,
including Rivian, Ford, and Volvo, already use Unreal Engine as Epic
pushes into automotive applications. 

 FASTER ANIMATIONS ON IOS 26 MAKES EVEN OLDER IPHONES FEEL LIKE NEW (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 iOS 26 introduces faster app launch animations with a subtle warp
effect, making apps reach near full-screen about 150 milliseconds
quicker and creating the impression of a snappier, more responsive
iPhone. While actual performance is unchanged, the speedier
pacing—similar to Android's—enhances perceived performance,
boosting user satisfaction, especially on high-refresh-rate displays. 

 DECART RAISES $100M ON $3.1B VALUATION TO GROW REAL-TIME AI VIDEO
PLATFORM (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Decart raised $100 million on a $3.1 billion valuation to expand its
real-time AI video platform technology. The company's GPU optimization
breakthrough reduces video generation costs from hundreds of dollars
per hour to under 25 cents. Decart's products, Oasis and MirageLSD,
enable real-time video generation for gaming, entertainment, and
interactive applications.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 BEING A DESIGNER USED TO FEEL LIKE A CAREER—NOW IT JUST FEELS LIKE
A JOB (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design has transformed from a meaningful career into just a job as
modern workflows stripped away its creative essence. Designers
ironically built the very systems, design frameworks, templates, and
AI tools that automated and sanitized their work while deluding
themselves about design's world-changing power. Reclaiming design as a
career requires small acts of resistance within existing systems,
defending creative choices, and maintaining authorship rather than
defaulting to safe, predictable options. 

 ON TEAMWORK (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This reflection on one year at Atlassian explores what makes great
teams across sports, tech, and fiction. Five key attributes are
identified: high trust, identity, shared intuition, shorthand
communication, and mission-driven purpose. Atlassian Design's strength
lies in its shared belief that it can become the best team. 

 WHERE HAVE ALL THE JUNIOR DESIGNERS GONE? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Only 13% of nearly 100 recent graphic design job listings were
entry-level, with most seeking senior-level skills from the start.
Companies are increasingly replacing junior roles with
internships—often unpaid or underpaid—leaving newcomers in cycles
of temporary work or unsustainable freelancing without clear career
progression.

 HOW I APPROACH MOTION IN PRODUCT DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A product designer outlines their systematic approach to motion
design, highlighting how animation critically shapes product feel,
guides user attention, and reinforces brand personality. Core
principles include defaulting to ease-out curves, matching animation
timing to element size, using faster exit transitions, and embracing
spring animations for natural interactions. The framework emphasizes
custom animation curves, motion libraries for enhanced capabilities,
and purposeful restraint to avoid overwhelming users with excessive
animation. 

 APPLE'S LIQUID GLASS SHATTERS TYPOGRAPHY (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple's iOS 26 introduces a Liquid Glass UI design that prioritizes
aesthetics over readability of typography. The interface suffers from
poor color contrast, fragile customization options, and buried
accessibility features. Designers should prioritize robust text
contrast and accessibility-first design over trendy transparency
effects.
