 YOUTUBE IS TESTING BLURRED THUMBNAILS FOR ‘MATURE CONTENT' (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube is testing a new feature that blurs thumbnails for video
results tied to frequent sexual themes. It aims to make browsing
safer, especially for younger or unaware users, by shielding them from
sensitive content at first glance. Titles and descriptions stay
visible, and unlike Google's SafeSearch, results are not
removed—users can unblur thumbnails if they choose. 

 PINTEREST LAUNCHES NEW TOOLS TO FIGHT AI SLOP (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pinterest has unveiled new tools to fight the rise of low quality
AI-generated content that has frustrated users. The platform will
label AI-edited images and let users limit how many AI Pins they see,
starting with categories like beauty and art. More features are coming
as Pinterest aims to balance innovation with user control. 

 WIX'S NEW PERSONALISED AI FEATURE IS BOTH INCREDIBLY COOL AND A BIT
CREEPY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Wix has introduced an AI-powered adaptive content feature to
personalize website content in real time for each visitor. While it
offers tailored experiences, some creatives question whether AI-driven
customization compromises authenticity. The feature, now available
through Wix Editor and Wix Studio, aims to deepen user-business
connections.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHY ARE BIG TECH COMPANIES SO SLOW? (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Big tech seems slow not due to bad engineers, but because complex,
interdependent features create huge coordination and cognitive
burdens. Every new feature must align with existing ones legally,
technically, and conceptually, making progress harder as products
grow. It may look inefficient, but it's a smart tradeoff to gain small
improvements that pay off big at scale. 

 THE CREATIVE POWER OF CONSTRAINTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creativity thrives not without limits but because of clear
constraints that guide and spark innovation. Design, architecture, and
art show how even simple rules can lead to diverse, imaginative
outcomes. The trick is balance—too few constraints cause paralysis,
too many stifle originality, but just enough enables breakthroughs. 

 WHY BRANCHING IN FIGMA DIDN'T WORK FOR US, AND HOW WE MANAGE DESIGN
VERSIONS NOW (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Managing Figma was tricky for its Devexperts team, who shifted from
single pages to multiple, then branching, and finally duplicating
files for version control. Branching caused conflicts and component
issues in their complex system. Now, separate files per app version
and a central file for new features help streamline collaboration,
align with production, and preserve context.
