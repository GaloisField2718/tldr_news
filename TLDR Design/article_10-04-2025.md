OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 WHERE DESIGN FINDS (AND LOSES) ITS SOUL (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The narrative that “UX is dead” stems from clickbait and thought
leaders who misrepresent design by prioritizing frameworks and
strategy over creativity and craft. This shift has led to a generation
of designers trained to follow the rules instead of challenging them,
resulting in safe, uninspiring work. To bring back the power of
design, we must embrace intuition, artistic conviction, and bold
ideas, balancing process with creativity and letting design be a human
and emotional expression again. 

 DESIGN SYSTEMS ARE GETTING READY FOR AGENTIC EXPERIENCES (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Agentic AI uses language models, pattern recognition, and automation
to act independently, setting goals and adapting to context. Unlike
traditional automation, it handles ambiguity, making design systems
smarter. It monitors consistency, updates documentation, and offers
contextual suggestions. This shift enhances human capability, enabling
faster decisions and more effective problem-solving in complex
environments. 

 THE SHAPE OF DESIGN TO COME (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Smaller teams with broader skills move quickly thanks to AI and
no-code tools. Full-stack designers, design engineers, and
democratized systems are rising. Expertise, creativity, and business
thinking remain essential for standing out. Tools reshape workflows,
but human judgment and distinct visual craft define impactful,
future-ready design teams.
