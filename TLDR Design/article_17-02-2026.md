 GEMINI 3 DEEP THINK CAN NOW TURN SKETCHES INTO 3D MODELS AND MORE (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google upgraded Gemini 3 Deep Think to tackle complex scientific and
engineering challenges, adding a sketch-to-3D modeling tool that
converts drawings into printable files. The enhanced reasoning mode
achieved gold medal-level performance on the 2025 International
Physics and Chemistry Olympiad written sections while improving
capabilities in mathematics and coding. Google AI Ultra subscribers
can now access Deep Think through the Gemini app, with API access
opening to select researchers and enterprises. 

 THIS IS THE FIRST SMARTPHONE DESIGNED BY KIDS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AT&T launched the amiGO Jr. phone, marketed as the first smartphone
designed for and by kids, featuring parental controls for managing
screen time, apps, location sharing, and schedules. Built with
Samsung, the device includes three rear cameras, an Exynos 1330 chip,
and a 6.7-inch display that parents can monitor from their own phones.
Critics question whether a "kid-friendly" smartphone is necessary and
note that the design lacks child-oriented features such as bright
colors or a smaller size. 

 NEW TITANS LOGO LEAKS TO FIERCE FAN RESPONSE (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A leaked new logo for the Tennessee Titans, reportedly set for the
2026 season, has sparked intense debate among NFL fans, with critics
calling the minimalist redesign boring and a downgrade due to the
removal of the iconic flames and shift from navy to light blue, while
supporters praise its clean, modern look. The redesign, which appears
on newly unveiled helmets, has fueled broader discussions about
minimalism in sports branding and the team's evolving identity, with
reactions ranging from enthusiasm to disbelief and nostalgia for the
Oilers era.

OPINIONS & TUTORIALS

 YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM NEEDS AN ENFORCER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Design systems require an enforcer—someone who ensures teams
actually use the system, integrates new patterns back into it, and
mediates conflicting needs across teams. Without enforcement, small
deviations compound quickly as teams optimize for their local goals,
creating inconsistent experiences that confuse users and burden
engineers with unmaintainable variations. Effective enforcement
balances saying yes to changes that benefit multiple teams while
rejecting one-off exceptions, requiring executive support, strategic
review timing, and responsiveness to real needs over system purity. 

 THE HIDDEN COST OF UNTRAINED DESIGN TEAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Untrained design teams create hidden costs through slower delivery,
inconsistent methods, compliance risks, and erosion of stakeholder
confidence as modern design demands grow increasingly complex. These
issues compound over time, leading to increased rework, agency
dependence, missed AI opportunities, and potential legal exposure from
accessibility failures. Structured team-wide training addresses these
operational hurdles by establishing shared standards, reducing
friction, building internal capability, and transforming reactive
compliance into proactive design practices. 

 I'M STUCK AS A MID-WEIGHT DESIGNER: NOW WHAT? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Career progress isn't defined by titles but by building skills,
confidence, and clarity about personal goals. Define what success
looks like individually, treat unconventional paths as strengths,
sharpen portfolios and strategic abilities, learn from those more
experienced, and leave environments that limit growth. Creative
careers are rarely linear. Advancement comes from intentional,
self-directed development.

 A COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE DESIGN THINKING PROCESS (16 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Design thinking is an iterative, five-stage process (Empathize,
Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test) that helps teams understand user
needs, challenge assumptions, and develop user-focused solutions to
complex problems. The methodology emphasizes putting customers at the
center of problem-solving and works across industries, requiring
collaborative mindsets, divergent and convergent thinking, and a
willingness to iterate based on user feedback. Organizations benefit
from design thinking through improved user understanding,
cross-departmental collaboration, and a sustained design culture. 

 LUKECHARLES AND RADDA CREATE NEW IDENTITY FOR THE MOTOR NEURONE
DISEASE (MND) ASSOCIATION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Motor Neurone Disease Association has unveiled its first major
rebrand in over a decade after research showed its previous identity
didn't clearly connect its name to its frontline impact. Developed by
lukecharles and Radda, the new strategy-led identity introduces a
warmer terracotta colour palette and fingerprint-inspired visuals to
reflect individuality, improve accessibility, and cut through digital
noise, aiming to feel more human, flexible, and impactful while
supporting the charity's ambitions to accelerate research, improve
care, and better represent people living with MND. 

 THIS TECH REBRAND IS MAKING ME FEEL MANIPULATED (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MachineX, a decentralised exchange built for the “autonomous
economy,” has unveiled a surprisingly warm and playful rebrand by
Koto's Berlin studio centered on the concept “Human x Machine” and
brought to life through bold colours, a sculpted custom serif
wordmark, narrative illustrations, and a friendly robot mascot named
Dexter. Drawing on sci-fi world-building influences, the identity aims
to humanise a futuristic platform where humans and machines transact
freely, though its cheerful aesthetic contrasts strikingly with the
potentially dystopian implications of its AI-driven vision.
