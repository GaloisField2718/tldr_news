HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI EXECUTIVES RATTLED BY CAMPAIGNS TO DERAIL FOR-PROFIT
RESTRUCTURING (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Some of California's biggest philanthropies, nonprofits, and labor
groups are joining forces to push back on OpenAI's plan to restructure
into a for-profit company. This has concerned OpenAI executives and
resulted in discussions about moving out of the state. OpenAI's
proposed plan is being investigated by Attorneys general in California
and Delaware. The startup could potentially be sued for breaking
nonprofit law and may be required to pay a settlement as a condition
for the restructure. 

 DATABRICKS CONFIRMS NEW $100B VALUATION ON $4B ARR (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Databricks has confirmed another $1 billion raise at a $100
billion-plus valuation. The company will use the funds to invest in
its database for AI agents. The round was led by Thrive and Insight
Partners, who also co-led the previous $10 billion raise. Databricks
has $4 billion in annual recurring revenue. 

 VEO 3 AND VEO 3 FAST – NEW PRICING, NEW CONFIGURATIONS, AND BETTER
RESOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google reduced Veo 3 pricing by nearly half to $0.40 per second and
added support for vertical 9:16 videos and 1080p HD output. 

 GROK IS WORKING ON BACKGROUND THINKING! (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Grok is working on a background thinking feature that appears to
allow users to continue chatting while the assistant thinks. A
screenshot of the toggle for the feature is available.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 RL-AS-A-SERVICE WILL OUTCOMPETE AGI COMPANIES (AND THAT'S GOOD) (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 RLaaS (Reinforcement Learning-as-a-Service) has proven performance,
lower costs, is more excludable, and is safer. AI companies pivoting
away from pursuing AGI towards RLaaS is good news because it promises
a switch to a safer mode of AI development. While RLaaS is not without
risks, the transition to an RLaaS model would reduce AI risk. The
concatenation of specialized models may create or assist general
intelligences. 

 COGNITION: THE DEVIN IS IN THE DETAILS (22 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Shawn Wang, founder of Smol AI, is joining Cognition, the makers of
the Devin AI software engineer. The vast majority of Wang's
equity/investor capital at Smol AI will be rolling over their
investment to Cognition as part of the deal. Wang will continue to
work on AI Engineer and Latent Space independently of Cognition. This
post explains in detail Wang's reasons for betting on Cognition. 

 WHY DO WE TAKE LLMS SERIOUSLY AS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF BIORISK? (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic details why it implemented ASL-3 safety protections against
biological weapons development, noting Claude now exceeds expert
performance on virology evaluations, and controlled trials showed
significant uplift with Opus 4 for acquiring bioweapons compared to
using just the open internet. It's obviously a low-probability risk,
but the impact is so high — just one infraction could mean thousands
of deaths — that it still requires serious evaluation and
restriction.

 I MADE AI CODING AGENTS MORE EFFICIENT (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI coding agents are great, but they're too wasteful, they don't hold
the context of the database, they only have a surface-level
understanding, and they're too susceptible to context rot. These
problems could be solved if agents had a semantic understanding of all
functions and context about how functions are connected to other parts
of code. This article looks at practical ways to make coding agents
more efficient. 

 META'S SET BLOCK DECODING (19 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Set Block Decoding enables parallel sampling of multiple future
tokens by combining next-token and masked token prediction. This
reduces decoding passes up to 5x without sacrificing accuracy.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DON'T BUILD AN RL ENVIRONMENT STARTUP (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Reinforcement Learning environments are sandboxes for AI models to
learn from. They keep track of an internal state, prompt AIs to take
actions to complete a task, and assign scores based on the outcome.
More and more startups are offering increasingly challenging
environments under the assumption that machine learning is solved and
the only remaining work is to provide models with simulations to learn
from. Frontier AI labs pay a lot of money for these environments, but
the supply side is set to become increasingly crowded - it likely
won't be a long-lived business. 

 JUDGE SKEWERS $1.5B ANTHROPIC SETTLEMENT WITH AUTHORS IN PIRATED
BOOKS CASE OVER AI TRAINING (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A federal judge expressed serious concerns about Anthropic's proposed
settlement over the use of 500,000 pirated books to train an internal
version of Claude. He questioned how the settlement money would be
distributed: “I have an uneasy feeling about hangers on with all
this money on the table.”
