 LAST CHANCE TO INVEST IN THE IP DISRUPTER THAT'S REANIMATING CINEMA'S
HIGHEST-GROSSING CHARACTERS WITH VR (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Round closes TODAY: In what some are calling the ‘biggest
interruption to IP since Disney', Elf Labs has stockpiled rights to
history's highest grossing characters – Cinderella, Snow White, The
Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, and more – and
is bringing them to life using patented AI-driven VR and AR

merchandise and content, while licensing and producing the next
generation of blockbusters and toys featuring these immortal
characters.

 OPENR1 UPDATE 2 (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hugging Face is replicating R1 in the open. It has succeeded in
running distillation on R1 itself to generate 800k reasoning traces. 

 AGENCY IS FRAME DEPENDENT (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Determining whether a system is “agentic” is challenging. This
position paper from DeepMind proposes the idea that measuring Agency
requires a set reference frame, and cannot be discussed as a global
property of a system. 

 TEMPORALLY-CORRELATED NOISE PRIOR FOR DIFFUSION MODELS (18 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Diffusion model noise sampling works well for single images, but
struggles when scaled up to videos that require temporal consistency.
As the noise itself is independent across pixels and frames, you see a
number of warping artifacts. This work aims to introduce integral
noise which accounts for many of these problems.

 OLMOE APP (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Tiny but extremely powerful open source model on an app, running
locally, by Allen AI. It is stronger than the original ChatGPT model
from a few years ago. 

 IMPROVED LLM PRETRAINING (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This paper presents dynamic instance-level data reweighting
techniques for LLM pretraining. By adjusting sample importance based
on loss values during training, the proposed methods improve
efficiency and effectiveness. 

 OPEN-VOCABULARY MULTI-OBJECT TRACKING BENCHMARK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 OVT-B is a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object

 DEMOCRATIZE INTELLIGENCE: A NETWORK OF TOP BUILDERS CREATING OPEN AI
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A group of 300+ AI builders including Chris Lattner (Creator of
Swift/LLVM) and Amjad Masad (Founder of Replit) met in San Francisco
at the Democratize Intelligence Summit (DEMI). DEMI is forming a
counter-pressure to closed AI centralization by gathering ambitious
builders creating alternative hardware chips, software frameworks, and
economic models that make AI easier to build and use. 

 GOOGLE I/O 2025 ANNOUNCED (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google I/O will take place on May 20-21 at Shoreline Amphitheatre and

sessions. 

 AIS AND ROBOTS SHOULD SOUND ROBOTIC (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI-generated voices can now precisely mimic human speech, raising
concerns about distinguishing them from human conversations. A
proposed solution is for AI voices to utilize a ring modulator, giving
them a historically recognizable robotic sound. Implementing this
across voice synthesis technologies would help users identify when
they are interacting with AI.
