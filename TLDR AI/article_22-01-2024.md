HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI CEO RAISING MONEY FOR DISTRIBUTED CHIP MANUFACTURING COMPANY
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman is reported to be raising money for a resilient and
distributed system of AI chip manufacturing factories. The current AI
chip supply chain is strongly tied to geopolitical conflicts and is at
risk of disruption. 

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND SCIENTISTS IN TALKS TO LEAVE AND FORM AI STARTUP (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A pair of scientists at Google's artificial intelligence subsidiary
DeepMind is in talks with investors to form an AI startup in Paris,
highlighting how in-demand top AI minds are at the moment. 

 THE AI PHONES ARE COMING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Samsung is set to unveil new AI-focused phones, highlighting the
evolution of AI in mobile technology, exemplified by Google's Pixel 8
Pro and the popular Rabbit R1 from CES 2024.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPDIVE: TEXT-TO-VIDEO (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Generating video from text descriptions is an active area of research
with many powerful models coming in the last few weeks. This blog from
the Hugging Face team outlines the task, current challenges, and the
state of the research. It isn‚Äôt completely comprehensive, but will
give a great starting point for further reading. 

 A MODEL FOR ALL KINDS OF IMAGE AND VIDEO SEGMENTATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 OMG-Seg is a new model that can perform various image and video
segmentation tasks using a single efficient system. Unlike traditional
methods that use different models for each task, OMG-Seg handles
everything from image semantics to interactive video segmentation,
making it a one-stop solution with reduced complexity and enhanced
performance. 

 OPEN-VOCABULARY VIDEO INSTANCE SEGMENTATION (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed BriVIS, a method that improves
open-vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS). By using a
technique called Brownian Bridges, BriVIS maintains the context of
object movements across video frames, leading to a more accurate
alignment between video and text.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WIKICHAT: BUILD A REAL-TIME RAG APP ON WIKIPEDIA WITH LANGCHAIN.JS,
VERCEL, AND ASTRA DB (SPONSOR) [11] 

 üÜï¬†DataStax has recently introduced its new Data API [12] ‚Äî an
easy way to develop GenAI and RAG apps on Astra DB. Want to see how it
works? Check out this upcoming livestream to hear from engineers at
DataStax and LangChain and dive into how they built WikiChat, a
natural language interface to Wikipedia. Register for the livestream
here [11] 

 LIBRARY FOR 3D PARALLELISM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 HuggingFace has released Nanotron, a small and powerful library for
training models with 3D parallelism. This means it splits the data,
the model, and the layers/tensors in the model. The first two types of
parallelism are well supported in libraries like PyTorch. However,
splitting the model tensors is custom to each model and hard to
implement in general. This library provides useful primitives to make
that process easier and less error-prone. 

 LIBRARY FOR DATA FILTERING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 HuggingFace has released Datatrove, a library for filtering large
text datasets. It has many useful primitives and full parallel
pipelines for text filtering. Examples using Gopher quality filters in
C4 are available. 

 IMAGE CAPTIONING SOFTWARE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Simple software that can be used to add captions to your images for
AI training.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW MICROSOFT FOUND A POTENTIAL NEW BATTERY MATERIAL USING AI (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have found a
new battery material using AI and large-scale cloud computing. The
material is a new kind of solid-state electrolyte. It could lead to
batteries that are less likely to burst into flames compared to
lithium-ion batteries. While the material still needs to be tested to
see whether it is a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries, the
finding demonstrates AI's potential for speeding up material
discovery. 

 CLEARER REMOTE SENSING IMAGES (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 RSHazeNet is a new framework designed to remove haze from
remote-sensing images. The tool uses innovative modules to better
understand and preserve important details in images, making them
clearer and more useful for analysis. 

 BOOSTING VISION FOUNDATION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 The new ViSFT method enhances vision foundation models, like those
used in image-text training, by applying a two-stage process similar
to fine-tuning in language models.

QUICK LINKS

 UNSTRUCTURED + LANGCHAIN HEALTHCARE COOKBOOK (SPONSOR) [19] 

 The insights outlined below underscore the value of leveraging
Unstructured and LangChain to optimize RAG architectures to process
semi-structured content from Independent Health‚Äôs data. 

 QLARY AI (PRODUCT) [20] 

 Deploy a call center AI without code. 

 AI TOOLKIT (GITHUB REPO) [21] 

 AI Toolkit is a header-only C++ library that brings finite state
machines, behavior trees, utility AI, and goal-oriented action
planning to game NPCs. 

 GOOGLE WILL PITCH BARD ADVANCED AS PROVIDING ‚ÄòCOMPLEX, BETTER
RESPONSES‚Äô (1 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The enhanced version of Bard promises to deliver more complex and
better responses compared to the current version, which runs on Gemini
Pro and competes with GPT 3.5.
