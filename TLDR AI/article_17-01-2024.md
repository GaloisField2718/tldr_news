HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SAKANA AI RAISES $30M SEED (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sakana.ai is building a world-class research lab in Tokyo to build
smaller and more efficient foundation models. The company was founded
by ex-Google researchers David Ha and Llion Jones, who are responsible
for breakthroughs such as Transformers, World Models, and LoRA. It has
raised a 30m seed round from Brandon Reeves at Lux Capital and Jon Chu
at Khosla Ventures to pioneer this effort and put Tokyo on the AI map.


 STABLECODE 3B (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A strong 3B model that outperforms the 7B CodeLlama model and is
small enough to run locally on MacBooks. 

 OPENAI ANNOUNCES TEAM TO BUILD ‚ÄòCROWDSOURCED‚Äô GOVERNANCE IDEAS
INTO ITS MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is forming a new Collective Alignment team to integrate public
input into its AI models.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TEACHING LANGUAGE MODELS TO LISTEN (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog explores the current dominant paradigm for taking a
pretrained language model and adding multimodal capabilities. Namely,
aligning the embeddings between an encoder and the text model. 

 SOLVE HARD PROBLEMS TRAINING ON EASY DATA (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hard problems have been thought to require hard data, but that data
is hard to label and noisy. This work shows that fine-tuning models on
related, but easy, data dramatically improves their generation
capabilities on hard problems. Another data point to support
fine-tuning as eliciting knowledge instead of adding knowledge. 

 PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a novel approach called Mutual
Distillation Learning For Person Re-identification (MDPR) that
enhances person re-identification by combining two different
techniques.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BENCHMARKING POWER BI ON MICROSOFT FABRIC: MARKETING OR A REAL
SEMANTIC LAYER SOLUTION? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Microsoft is marketing that its Direct Lake architecture on Fabric is
the ideal way to run direct queries on cloud storage in Power BI. Does
the data support their claim? This webinar [12] will dive deep into
AtScale‚Äôs TPC-DS benchmark report [12] that tests the scalability,
cost effectiveness and manageability of Microsoft Fabric Architecture.

 TENCENT PHOTOMAKER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 One of the most viral uses of generative image models is personal
stylized image generation. Historically, this required training a LoRA
or using DreamBooth. Now, with the use of ID embeddings, you can
dramatically improve quality while reducing computational cost, with
just a single image. 

 DIFFUSION MODELS FOR CONTENT SUPER RESOLUTION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Following the recent trend of repurposing diffusion models for
various other vision tasks, this work improves the stability of
training for super resolution and upscaling. 

 ENHANCING AI UNDERSTANDING WITH CONTEXT FILTERING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 FILCO is a new technique designed to improve AI systems, especially
in areas like answering questions and checking facts, by giving them
better context. It works by choosing the most helpful information and
training models to filter out less relevant details. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 HAIKU DPO DATASET (HUGGINGFACE DATASET) [16] 

 Dataset to help align models to write correct Haiku‚Äôs. 

 THE LAZY TYRANNY OF THE WAIT CALCULATION (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The "Wait Calculation" concept advises delaying actions, like a space
journey to Barnard's Star or starting certain projects, until
technology sufficiently advances to save significant time and effort.
However, this approach must be balanced against potential learning
losses and the unpredictability of technological progress. 

 IMPROVING THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF AI EXPLANATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 This project improves the Model Parameter Randomisation Test, a key
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), by introducing two new versions: Smooth
MPRT and Efficient MPRT.

 Meta recently announced a suite of music and sound generation models
that sound incredible. It has now released the models with inference
code. 

 TINY NARRATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Tiny Narrations is a text-to-speech read version of the popular (and
small) Tiny Stories dataset. It uses XTTS2 on the SF Compute H100
cluster. 

 HUMANLINKER (PRODUCT) [23] 

 An AI assistant that helps sales teams with personalized prospecting
and efficient meeting preparation.
