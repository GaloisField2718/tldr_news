HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NVIDIA'S NEW WORLD MODELS (34 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nvidia has released a new suite of World Models based on its Cosmos
tokenization scheme. These have extremely powerful physics
understanding and are on the Hugging Face platform. They seem to
primarily be useful for robotics and industrial applications, but have
the ability to create videos in other domains.

 The next version of fully differentiable geometric mesh
representation is now available. It has a number of improvements that
make it suitable for learning and shape representation. 

 AGENTS (34 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post explores Agents what they are used for, where they fail,
and where they will be successful. It also talks through planning and
execution pipelines. 

 LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL EXPLAINABILITY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This project improves the interpretability of large multimodal models
by visualizing concepts and connecting them to input-output behavior.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI WILL BE DEAD IN FIVE YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI's success could render it less discussed in five years as it
becomes an integral part of everyday technology and business
solutions. The term may evolve, with current AI being redefined, much
like how big data has become ubiquitous. Machine learning will become
the main focus as AI transforms into standard functionality. 

 YOU MUST SEE HOW FAR AI VIDEO HAS COME (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google DeepMind's Veo 2 sets a new benchmark in AI video generation,
surpassing competitors with its quality, consistency, and prompt
accuracy. The rise of deep fakes blurs reality, fostering creativity
but undermining trust in visual content. There is concern over losing
cultural continuity and the ability to discern reality as
technological advancements accelerate. 

 BEYOND THE HYPE: AI, INNOVATION AND RATIONAL INVESTMENT IN 2025 (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Valuable AI companies are predicted to have strong growth in 2024
while many hyped ventures may falter. Vertical integration and
buy-and-build strategies are expected to rise, capitalizing on markets
needing technology streamlining. A shift towards emerging,
capacity-constrained managers will contrast with the decline of
overfunded growth companies from 2020-2021.
