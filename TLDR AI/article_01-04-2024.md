HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK 1.5 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 xAI announced its next model, with 128k context length and improved
reasoning capabilities. It excels at retrieval and programming. 

 MICROSOFT AND OPENAI PLANNING $100B SUPERCOMPUTER (1 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly planning a joint data center
project that could reach $100 billion in cost, culminating in the
launch of a massive AI supercomputer named ‚ÄúStargate‚Äù by 2028. 

 IN ONE KEY A.I. METRIC, CHINA PULLS AHEAD OF THE U.S.: TALENT (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 China is now producing almost half of the world‚Äôs top AI
researchers, surpassing the US, with 18% coming from US undergrad
institutions. Despite pioneering AI breakthroughs, the US relies
heavily on Chinese-born researchers, with Chinese talent making up 38%
of top US-based AI professionals. The trend of Chinese researchers
staying in China rather than moving to the US could impact global AI
leadership dynamics.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BUILDING EVALS FOR BUSINESS PROBLEMS (25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Data, evals, and compute are essential for strong performing AI. This
is especially true in enterprises. Evals may be one key moat that
allows organizations to improve their AI products. 

 CAPTIONING OUTDOOR SCENES (29 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have introduced a new approach to understanding outdoor
environments, overcoming obstacles like the varying conditions and
lack of data that have previously limited advancements. 

 MAKING LANE-CHANGES SAFER IN BUSY TRAFFIC (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a control framework that combines AI and
predictive models to facilitate smooth and safe lane changes in dense
traffic, emphasizing cooperation with nearby drivers.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LEARN HOW TO BUILD GENAI RAG APPS USING AIRBYTE, DATASTAX, AND XKCD
COMICS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 On April 2 [10], hang out with Airbyte's Bindi Pankhudi and
DataStax's Carter Rabasa as they dive into building a GenAI RAG app
that can query the xkcd webcomic canon. This fun and interactive
livestream [10] will be chock full of code, covering the nitty gritty
of:¬†
‚ñ™Ô∏è Ingesting data at scale from multiple sources

‚ñ™Ô∏è Vectorizing that data using LLMs

‚ñ™Ô∏è Storing the information in a vector database

‚ñ™Ô∏è Using RAG to build a smart search engine

Space will be limited, so make sure to register today! [10]

 VOICECRAFT CLONING AND TTS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Zero shot voice cloning and speech generation capabilities in a
powerful 700m parameter model. 

 INTERRUPTING COW (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 In natural conversation, people sometimes interrupt or talk over one
another. This can be key to quickly coming to a consensus. This AI
assistant predicts tokens while the person is talking and if it
predicts enough in a row it will interrupt. 

 TESTING THE CODING ABILITIES OF LLMS WITH A NEW CODE BENCHMARK
(GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 EvoEval is a new benchmark suite that tests the coding abilities of
Large Language Models more rigorously than ever before.

MISCELLANEOUS

 QWEN MOE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Qwen MoE is equivalent in performance to a strong 7B model with 1‚ÅÑ3
of the activated parameters. 

 HOW AUTONOMOUS RACING IS PUSHING SELF-DRIVING CARS FORWARD (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Autonomous racing is advancing AI and machine learning in high-stress
conditions, with competitions like the Indy Autonomous Challenge
accelerating innovation in vehicle safety. Researchers and students
use platforms like F1tenth for algorithm development, pushing the
limits of autonomous vehicle capabilities on actual racetracks. These
high-speed challenges contribute to a better understanding of machine
perception, decision-making, and control systems for real-world
traffic applications. 

 ‚ÄúTHE KING IS DEAD‚Äù ‚Äî CLAUDE 3 SURPASSES GPT-4 ON CHATBOT ARENA
FOR THE FIRST TIME (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus has surpassed OpenAI's GPT-4 for the first
time on Chatbot Arena. Chatbot Arena is a leaderboard run by the Large
Model Systems Organization, a research organization dedicated to open
models. Its site allows visitors to rate outputs from various models,
enabling it to calculate the best models in aggregate. While Claude's
rise is notable, GPT-4 is now over a year old.

 DOES AI NEED A ‚ÄúBODY‚Äù TO BECOME TRULY INTELLIGENT? (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The embodiment hypothesis argues true intelligence necessitates
physical interaction, prompting advancements in AI through simulations
and real-world testing, despite challenges like the "sim-to-real gap,"
leading to the cautious deployment of AI robots in industries. 

 MICROSOFT COPILOT AI WILL SOON RUN LOCALLY ON PCS (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Microsoft's Copilot AI will soon run locally on PCs, requiring future
AI PCs to have built-in neural processing units capable of over 40
TOPS. 

 AIRTABLE AI (PRODUCT) [19] 

 Harness the power of AI and incorporate it directly into your
workflows.
