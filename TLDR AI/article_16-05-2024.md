HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI CHIEF SCIENTIST ILYA SUTSKEVER IS OFFICIALLY LEAVING (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist, is
officially leaving the company. Sutskever helped lead the coup against
Sam Altman and then later changed his mind. His employment status had
been ambiguous since the ouster. Jakub Pachocki, the company's
director of research, will be OpenAI's new chief scientist. 

 PROJECT IDX, GOOGLE'S NEXT-GEN IDE, IS NOW IN OPEN BETA (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Project IDX is an AI-centric, browser-based development environment
that was launched as an invite-only service in August. Over 100,000
developers have already tried the service, which is now available in
open beta. Google has added an integration with the Google Maps
Platform into the IDE and integrations with the Chrome Dev Tools and
Lighthouse to help debug applications. It will soon enable deploying
apps to Cloud Run, Google Cloud's serverless platform for running
front- and back-end services, and integrate with Checks, Google's
AI-powered compliance platform.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 COIN3D (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Generating 3D models is challenging. Allowing users to input a coarse
mesh first and then run generation allows for finer-grained control
and improved output quality from the model. 

 A NEW BENCHMARK IN TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION FOR ENGLISH AND CHINESE
(34 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The newly developed Hunyuan-DiT sets a benchmark in text-to-image
diffusion transformers, especially for English and Chinese. It
features advanced transformer structures and a refined data pipeline
for continual model improvement. 

 IMPROVING DIFFUSION MODELS WITH PERTURBED-ATTENTION (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG) is an approach to enhancing the
quality of images generated by diffusion models without additional
training or external modules. By creatively manipulating
self-attention mechanisms within the model, PAG significantly improves
the structure and fidelity of both unconditional and conditional
samples.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 INGEST USERS' 3RD PARTY DATA FOR YOUR APP'S RAG PIPELINE (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Building a useful AI SaaS product [10] requires your models to have
access to your users' external data (documents, Slack convos, emails,
CRM data etc.) for your multi-tenant RAG pipeline. [11]
Paragon is an embedded data ingestion engine [10] that engineering
teams rely on to extract users' data from 100+ sources, without the
plumbing.

 IC-RELIGHT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 AI Relighting tool that uses foreground separation and text
conditioning for extremely strong results. 

 EFFICIENT MOBILE VIDEO UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SqueezeTime is a new lightweight network designed for mobile video
understanding that condenses the time axis of videos into the channel
dimension to enhance temporal analysis. 

 SPEEDING UP FOUNDATION MODEL TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 EfficientTrain++ introduces a novel curriculum learning strategy that
significantly reduces the training time of major visual models like
ResNet and Swin by up to three times on ImageNet databases.

 AI SPENDING GREW 293% LAST YEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ramp's Q1 analysis reveals a 293% year-over-year increase in
AI-related spending among its customers, outpacing overall software
spend growth, with a significant adoption in non-tech sectors like
healthcare and financial services, indicating a broader integration of
AI into various industries. Despite a general slowdown in new
investments in AI, companies already using AI are doubling down, with
average spending on AI tools growing by 138% year-over-year, while
finance tools also see increased usage and businesses maintain
cautious approaches to travel expenditure. 

 DETECTING OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DATA (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Hopfield Boosting is a technique that utilizes modern Hopfield energy
to enhance the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data in machine
learning models.
