HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

OPENAI ROLLING OUT CHATGPT PLUGINS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://mashable.com/article/open-ai-rollout-chatgpt-plugins?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI is rolling out ChatGPT 70+ plugins to premium subscribers this
week, allowing users to access the internet. 

GOOGLE UNVEILS CODEY (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://9to5google.com/2023/05/10/google-codey-programming-generative-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses Google's introduction of a new generative AI
model called Codey, designed to assist programmers in writing code.
Codey is a code-generating model that can provide users with
suggestions, identify errors, and even complete entire blocks of code.
It aims to streamline the coding process and boost developer
productivity by helping users find solutions quickly and efficiently.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

INSTRUCT BLIP (33 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500?utm_source=tldrai] 

Blip is a model developed by Salesforce that can be used for vision
and language tasks. Following the line of work in language models that
tunes them to follow instructions, we can also tune these vision
language models to follow instructions. This dramatically improves the
performance, and in this case it even outperforms the published
numbers of GPT-4. 

PROMPT INJECTION EXPLAINED (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/?utm_source=tldrai]


A full introduction into prompt injection, a term used in the field of
AI to describe the practice of deliberately inserting specific inputs
into an AI model to obtain desired outputs, including why it‚Äôs an
important issue and why many of the proposed solutions won‚Äôt be
effective. 

ENHANCING IMAGE QUALITY WITH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015?utm_source=tldrai] 

A new technique has been created that enhances the quality of blurry
images using pre-set text-to-image models. This method smartly uses a
special encoder and doesn't need to change the existing image-making
model, saving training time. Plus, users can control image quality
with one simple adjustment. The strategy also handles larger images
better than previous methods. Tests with both artificial and
real-world images prove it's more effective than current solutions.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

DETECTION THROUGH REASONING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/OptimalScale/DetGPT?utm_source=tldrai] 

When detecting objects in a scene, you usually pull from a set of
predefined classes. Also, asking questions about the scene is
challenging. In this case, we can use powerful language models
(Vicuna) with instruction tuned detectors to reason about queries and
detect objects as a result. 

OPEN-LLAMA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/s-JoL/Open-Llama?utm_source=tldrai] 

The complete training code of the open-source high-performance Llama
model, including the full process from pre-training to RLHF. 

PALM (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/conceptofmind/PaLM?utm_source=tldrai] 

An open-source implementation of Google's PaLM models.

MISCELLANEOUS

COHERE LLM UNIVERSITY (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://docs.cohere.com/docs/llmu?utm_source=tldrai] 

Cohere is a startup that offers a language model API similar to other
big players. They have a set of powerful models that you can use to
build applications. This language model university is designed to
bring you up to speed on modern language models and show how to build
on them with cohere's tools. 

HOW LONG WILL BIG TECH OPEN SOURCE AI HANDOUTS LAST? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/12/1072950/open-source-ai-google-openai-eleuther-meta/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article dives into how long big tech companies will continue to
provide open-source AI material, especially in light of the recent
leaked memo suggesting that Google and OpenAI will lose out to the
open-source community. 

CHATBOTS STILL STRUGGLE WITH NEGATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-like-chatgpt-are-no-good-at-not-20230512/?utm_source=tldrai]


Despite the remarkable capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT, they do
have limitations. In particular, they lack common sense reasoning and
are unable to understand context beyond the immediate text they are
processing. This inability can lead to nonsensical, inconsistent, or
biased responses. This is due to the training method, which involves
learning from vast amounts of text data but doesn't include an
understanding of the world or the ability to reason about it.
Researchers are exploring ways to improve these aspects of AI, but
significant challenges remain.

EASY PARALLELISM WITH JAX SHARD MAP (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jep/14273-shard-map.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Modern ML requires computation across many hardware accelerators like
GPUs. Getting this right, in code, is tricky. Jax has been leading
with many experimental features. Shmap is another in a long line of
innovations. It is powerful and allows easy implementation of modern
algorithms and scalable training. 

NEW RETRIEVAL FRAMEWORK IN LANGCHAIN (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/examples/flare.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Language models use retrieval to get up to date information or
information that doesn't fit in the context. This forward looking
retrieval uses a Google search API and large language models from Open
AI to build a robust retrieval question answering system.
