 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION — AGENTS, INTEGRATIONS,
WORKFLOWS, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to become part of your organizational DNA - and that
means enabling every department to build out their own use cases,
without IT gatekeepers standing in the way. But it shouldn't mean an
ungoverned free-for-all.

Airia is the “let's get serious about AI adoption” platform [4].
Rapidly prototype, deploy, and manage AI agents that transform
workflows across your organization - without sacrificing security or
governance.

Connect to dozens of enterprise applications with native integrations.
Build agents quickly with templates and no-code tools [4]. Let
everyone build with AI while maintaining visibility and control.

Plans start at just $49/month. Get a demo [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI WORKS ON GROK CODE REMOTE TO RIVAL OPENAI'S CODEX (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 xAI will host a hackathon on December 6-7. Participants will receive
early access to experimental models. The company is working on a
feature called Grok Code Remote to align with industry trends towards
cloud-based code execution. It will allow users to run code in remote
environments directly from the web. 

 ANTHROPIC IS ON TRACK TO TURN A PROFIT MUCH FASTER THAN OPENAI (6
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI forecasts that it won't turn a profit until 2030, while
Anthropic expects to break even for the first time in 2027. OpenAI is
also expected to burn roughly 14 times as much cash as Anthropic
before turning a profit. The two most valuable AI startups are taking
vastly different approaches to growth. OpenAI is investing heavily in
chips and data centers. Anthropic is taking a more cautious approach,
making sure that costs grow more in line with revenue. 

 YOU CAN NOW TEST UPCOMING GPT-5.1 ON OPENROUTER (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's latest code updates reference a general availability date of
November 24 for the GPT-5.1 family for Enterprise accounts. Plus and
Pro users may gain access to the models even earlier, possibly within
the coming week. GPT-5.1 Thinking may currently be testing under the
name Polaris Alpha on platforms such as OpenRouter. Polaris Alpha has
a 256k context window and quite good performance.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI DIFFUSION REPORT: WHERE AI IS MOST USED, DEVELOPED, AND BUILT (20
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI has reached 1.2 billion users in under three years, marking the
fastest technology adoption in human history. However, the Global
North's adoption rate is nearly double that of the Global South. The
next 1–2 billion users may come easily, but adoption is expected to
plateau afterward because the remaining ~4 billion people lack
electricity or internet access. Low-resource languages create an
additional barrier: half the web is in English, even though only 5% of
people speak it natively. 

 THE 4.5 TRILLION DOLLAR ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nvidia, currently valued at $4.5 trillion, is the most valuable
company on Earth and the dominant supplier of AI chips. A pattern of
fear around the company is impacting policy discussion. There are
claims that the major AI companies disagree with Nvidia's policy
stances, but are unwilling to speak out because Nvidia has the power
to undermine their business. This article looks at the evidence of
such claims.

 OMNILINGUAL ASR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Omnilingual ASR is a speech recognition system that supports over
1,600 languages, with hundreds never before covered by other ASR
technology. New languages can be added with just a few paired examples
without specialized expertise or large datasets. Omnilingual ASR is
designed for broad accessibility - it is aimed at making speech
technology more inclusive and adaptable for communities and
researchers worldwide. 

 EGOCENTRIC-10K (HUGGING FACE REPO) [13] 

 Egocentric-10K is a hand visibility and active manipulation data set
with 10,000 hours of video. It contains 192,900 video clips of 2,138
workers completing tasks in real factories. A video showing examples
of some of the clips is available in the repository. 

 AMA WITH MOONSHOT AI, THE OPEN-SOURCE FRONTIER LAB BEHIND KIMI K2
THINKING MODEL (REDDIT THREAD) [14] 

 Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 is a Mixture-of-Experts model with 32 billion
activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance in frontier knowledge, math, and coding
among non-thinking models and also has agentic abilities. Kimi-K2-Base
and Kimi-K2-Instruct were recently open sourced. This thread contains
a discussion with the team at Moonshot AI.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EVERY AI APPLICATION STARTUP IS LIKELY TO BE CRUSHED BY RAPID
EXPANSION OF THE FOUNDATIONAL MODEL PROVIDERS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There is now almost no time to build a company and scale it. There
are two ways an AI application founder can make money: make a
flash-in-the-pan app that generates a ton of cash over a short period,
or make a good enough app to get acquired by one of the big players.
The situation is highly unstable. The best way to play is to find an
application niche in a highly specialized field with extremely unique
and specific data barriers. 

 NEW LEAKED IMAGE SAMPLES BY NANO BANANA 2 (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Nano Banana 2 access was briefly leaked, and image samples were
widely circulated across social media. The model appears capable of
remastering low-quality images and following detailed text prompts.
There is still no confirmation of the release date, but a launch is
likely to be imminent. The leaked samples are available in the
article.
