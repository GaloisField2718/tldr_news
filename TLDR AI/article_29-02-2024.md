HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META LLAMA 3 MODEL PLANNED FOR JULY (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's Llama team is reportedly still working on alignment to enable
the model to loosen up and answer more queries that aren‚Äôt actually
controversial. 

 MODAL ADDS WEBSOCKETS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most serverless GPU offerings require one POST request per model
inference. However, this is a challenge in cases where you want to
stream model outputs. Websockets make streaming possible. 

 TIM COOK SAYS APPLE WILL ‚ÄòBREAK NEW GROUND‚Äô IN GENERATIVE AI (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at the company's annual shareholders
meeting that the company plans to break new ground in generative AI in
2024, promising transformative opportunities for users.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VIDEO AS THE NEW LANGUAGE FOR REAL-WORLD DECISION MAKING (26 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 An amazing paper that frames video as a potentially better way for AI
to interact with human users. It shows how video models can be used as
planners, agents, compute engines, and environment simulators. 

 1BIT LLMS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most language models use 16 or more bits to represent a parameter in
a model. This results in powerful models that can be expensive to run.
This work proposes a method that uses 1.58 bits per parameter - each
parameter is in {-1, 0, 1}. This method matches performance exactly up
to 3B parameters. No code or models have been released yet. 

 ENHANCING VISUAL PERCEPTION IN AI MODELS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This research focuses on advancing multi-modality foundation models
like GPT-4V in low-level visual perception tasks. The large-scale
experiment gathered feedback on 18,973 images from 58,000 humans and
created the Q-Pathway dataset to analyze clarity, color, and
brightness.

 DRUG DESIGN WITH GRAPH DIFFUSION POLICY OPTIMIZATION (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 Graph diffusion policy optimization enhances graph generation models
for drug design using a unique reinforcement learning technique. This
approach promises better performance in creating complex and diverse
graph structures and could set new standards in the field. 

 LLMS HANDLE 100K TOKENS WITH DUAL CHUNK ATTENTION (14 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Dual Chunk Attention (DCA) extends the capabilities of large language
models like Llama2 70B, allowing them to handle over 100k tokens
without additional training. It breaks down attention computation into
chunks, enhancing the model's understanding of both short and
long-range context. 

 DISTILABEL FRAMEWORK FOR ALIGNMENT DATA COLLECTION (GITHUB REPO) [15]


 Distilabel is a framework designed for AI engineers that aligns large
language models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF)-related methods such as reward models and DPO. It primarily
focuses on LLM fine-tuning and adaptation. Distilabel assists with
data collection, cleaning, and training.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STARCODER V2 (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Big Code project has released another version of its flagship
coding model. The model has a 16k context window and was trained on 4T
tokens. Its performance is strong, but still under that of DeepSeek
coder. 

 LEARNING FROM HETEROGENEOUS GRAPHS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 HiGPT is an approach to learning across diverse heterogeneous graphs
without the need for fine-tuning. Its integration with a novel graph
tokenizer and a vast corpus of graph instructions allows it to excel
in adapting to various data distributions. 

 ONLINE SHOPPING WITH MULTI-MODAL KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION (16 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 PromptMM improves recommendation systems on platforms like Amazon and
TikTok by using Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation. It addresses
inaccuracies in user preferences and simplifies systems by distilling
important features from various content types (visual, textual, or
acoustic) to prevent overfitting.

 SHAPE SUFFIXES FOR ML CODING (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A coding style at Character AI dramatically improves the readability
of shapes in tensors. 

 ADOBE GENERATIVE AI DOCUMENT & PDF TOOL (PRODUCT) [21] 

 Adobe Acrobat's new AI Assistant can query documents for answers with
attribution, create document summaries, offer a list of suggested
questions for deeper insights, assist in drafting content for various
communication needs, and provide outlines and key points so users can
swiftly navigate essential document information.
