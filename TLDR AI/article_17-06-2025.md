 THE MICROSOFT-OPENAI RELATIONSHIP FALTERS OVER WINDSURF ACQUISITION
(1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI executives have considered accusing Microsoft of
anticompetitive behavior as tensions escalate over the AI startup's $3
billion acquisition of Windsurf, whose coding IP OpenAI wants to keep
from Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. The standoff highlights OpenAI's
struggle to reduce its dependence on Microsoft's cloud services while
still needing the tech giant's approval to complete its for-profit
conversion. 

 OPENAI WINS $200 MILLION U.S. DEFENSE CONTRACT (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The one-year deal marks OpenAI's first public Defense Department
contract and follows similar moves by rival lab Anthropic and the
weapons-maker Anduril, which recently signed a $100 million contract.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CODING AGENTS HAVE CROSSED A CHASM (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Powerful AI coding tools are shifting developers from writing code to
architecting solutions and crafting precise problem descriptions.
Feeding Claude ASCII sequence diagrams of OAuth flows or entire DOM
trees from Chrome DevTools turned one developer's 45-minute debugging
sessions into 10-minute fixes. However, AI amplifies both strengths
and misconceptions—it'll confidently help you implement terrible
architecture faster than ever before. 

 AI SHOULD BE WARM BUT NOT ALIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The lead of model behavior and policy at OpenAI outlines the
company's approach to managing the increasingly emotional connections
users form with ChatGPT. While AI consciousness remains scientifically
unknowable, OpenAI wants to avoid encouraging users to perceive models
as sentient without evidence to support it. Its goal is to create a
model that's warm and approachable that doesn't claim to have an inner
life.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 BUILD WHAT'S NEXT WITH AI: SAVE $700 ON TICKETS TO GITHUB UNIVERSE
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 See unreleased AI features before everyone else, network with
developers you actually admire [11], and learn stuff that doesn't
waste your time. Join workshops, panels, and interactive product
demos. Make connections that will last a lifetime. San Francisco or
virtual. SUPER EARLY BIRD PASSES ARE ALMOST GONE—GRAB YOURS AND SAVE
$700 WHILE YOU STILL CAN. [11] 

 🇵 🇷 🇴 🇲 🇵 🇹 🇸 ARE AN API PRIMITIVE NOW! (1
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Prompts are now an API primitive on OpenAI's services. Developers can
now centrally manage, version, and optimize prompts across the
Playground, API, Evals, and Stored Completions. Prompts can be
preconfigured with tools, models, and messages. The change was
designed to help developers refine and reuse prompts better and
faster. 

 NANONETS OCR SMALL (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Nanonets-OCR-s is a state-of-the-art image-to-markdown OCR model that
goes far beyond traditional text extraction. The model can transform
documents into structured markdown with intelligent content
recognition and semantic tagging. It understands document structure
and content context and can deliver intelligently formatted markdown
output ready for downstream processing by large language models.
Nanonets-OCR-s can recognize LaTeX equations, intelligently describe
images, detect and isolate signatures, extract watermarks, handle
checkboxes, and extract complex tables. 

 CODE INTERPRETER REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CoRT post‑trains large reasoning models with hint engineering so
they can delegate calculations to external code interpreters. 

 TREERL FOR ON‑POLICY LLM TRAINING (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TreeRL uses on‑policy tree search and intermediate supervision to
train LLMs without a separate reward model, delivering stronger math
and code reasoning than ChainRL.

 AI USE AT WORK HAS NEARLY DOUBLED IN TWO YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A Gallup survey found that 40% percent of U.S. employees now use AI
at work, with white-collar workers driving adoption. Technology
workers lead with 50% frequent AI use while production and frontline
workers remain stuck at 9%.
