There‚Äôs endless chatter about LLMs these days. But the people who
actually have interesting things to say are the ones using LLMs in the
wild. Our upcoming LLMs in Production Conference
[https://home.mlops.community/public/events/llm-in-prod-part-ii-2023-06-20?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=0606]
is your chance to hear from the experts moving the field forward,
rather than random influencers.
Join us for two days of talking with some of our favorite people at
the forefront of using LLMs. There will be over 70 speakers

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

VICO: LIGHTWEIGHT TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION USING DIFFUSION MODELS
(GITHUB REPO) [https://github.com/haoosz/vico?utm_source=tldrai]

ViCo is a new technique designed to generate realistic images based on
textual descriptions, with the ability to capture fine details of
novel concepts from just a few examples. Unlike other methods, ViCo is
light on system resources and doesn't need to fine-tune the original
model's parameters, yet it still outperforms leading models by
focusing on visual semantics, using an attention-based object mask and
employing a unique way to reduce overfitting. 

GATEON: A NEW METHOD FOR BETTER CONTINUAL LEARNING (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01690?utm_source=tldrai]

GateON is a new technique that helps neural networks learn a series of
tasks without forgetting previous ones, a common problem known as
'catastrophic forgetting'. It achieves this by creating overlapping
connections between tasks and protecting important knowledge from
being overwritten. GateOn has a mechanism to re-activate 'fixed'
neurons, making it a powerful tool for large-scale learning tasks,
whether it's identifying hand-written numbers or understanding natural
language.

PROMPT-FREE DIFFUSION: A LEAP FORWARD IN TEXT-TO-IMAGE CONVERSION
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/shi-labs/prompt-free-diffusion?utm_source=tldrai]

This study presents an approach in text-to-image (T2I) research by
introducing 'Prompt-Free Diffusion', a system that generates images
solely based on visual inputs, with no text prompts required. It
utilizes a unique structure called 'Semantic Context Encoder
(SeeCoder)' to interpret a reference image, an optional image
structure, and some initial noise, making it easier to create
detailed, personalized images and outperforming previous image
synthesis methods. 

TREE OF THOUGHT (GITHUB REPO)

Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is an all-new powerful and flexible algorithm
that advances model reasoning by 70%

This repo supports the paper "QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized
LLMs", an effort to democratize access to LLM research. 

INTRODUCING OCTOAI: THE FASTEST WAY TO RUN, TUNE, AND SCALE GENERATIVE
MODELS (SPONSOR)

AI DOES NOT HELP PROGRAMMERS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/273577-ai-does-not-help-programmers/fulltext?utm_source=tldrai]

In this article, Bertrand Meyer argues that AI does not help
programmers and that it is not a silver bullet for software
development. He cites several reasons for this, including the fact
that AI is not always accurate, can be difficult to integrate into
existing workflows, and can be expensive to implement.
