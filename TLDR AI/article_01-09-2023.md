HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

META RELEASES FACET DATASET (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/31/meta-releases-a-data-set-to-probe-computer-vision-models-for-biases/?utm_source=tldrai]

Meta has released a new AI benchmark, FACET, designed to evaluate the
‚Äúfairness‚Äù of AI models that classify and detect things in photos
and videos, including people. 

BAIDU LAUNCHES ERNIE CHATBOT (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853878/baidu-launch-ernie-ai-chatbot-china?utm_source=tldrai]

Chinese tech giant Baidu officially launched its Ernie chatbot after
the government approved its application. 

GOOGLE LAUNCHES TPU V5 AND H100 ENABLED VMS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-cloud-tpu-v5e-and-a3-gpus-in-ga?utm_source=tldrai]

Google is one of the few large organizations with hardware that can
take on Nvidia. It has been challenging to use in the past with
somewhat poor PyTorch support. Now, with even faster chips, and better
software support - it seems like a compelling offering from the search
giant.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

EVALUATING THE FAIRNESS OF COMPUTER VISION MODELS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.meta.com/blog/dinov2-facet-computer-vision-fairness-evaluation/?utm_source=tldrai]

In its continued push to be an open source contributor for AI, Meta
released their amazing DINO v2 model under a more permissive license
that allows the community to build on top of it. In addition, they
released a data set that helps determine and benchmark bias in various
computer vision models. 

PREDICT VIDEO CONTENT BY SEPARATING MOTION AND APPEARANCE (18 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16154v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Predicting video content is tricky because the system must guess
object movements and keep them looking consistent. This new system,
MMVP, separately handles motion and appearance using special "motion
matrices" that focus just on movement. This method is not only more
accurate but also more efficient and compact than current top systems.


ENHANCING IMAGE GENERATION WITH TEXTURAL MODULATION (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16110v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Producing diverse images from just a few examples is challenging.
TexMod uses unique techniques to blend in details from various images
and makes sure the created images have a logical layout.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

IMPROVING IMAGE QUALITY WITH SMART DECODING TECHNIQUES (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/llvy21/duic?utm_source=tldrai]

This project developed a method that adjusts how images are decoded,
especially for unfamiliar datasets. This process updates certain
settings in the decoder, ensuring high-quality images without using
much data. The system also adapts on the fly, depending on the type of
image, for optimal results. 

HOW FEEDBACK AFFECTS LLMS? (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/hritikbansal/sparse_feedback?utm_source=tldrai]

When training large language models to understand and match human
values, do we use scores (rating) or comparisons (ranking) as
feedback? This study found that the choice matters a lot. For
instance, models trained with rankings are preferred when evaluated by
comparison but not always by scoring. This shows that how we choose to
give feedback has big implications for how well the model works in
real-life situations.

DO MOST PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SLOW DOWN AI? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://learningfromexamples.substack.com/p/do-most-people-really-want-to-slow?utm_source=tldrai]

Despite what you may see in the media, there are a number of issues
with the polls and surveys saying that a majority of people want to
slow down AI development. 

OPENAI BASE MODELS ARE NOT SYCOPHANTIC (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3ou8DayvDXxufkjHD/openai-api-base-models-are-not-sycophantic-at-any-size?utm_source=tldrai]

Inverse scaling problems are things that get worse as model size
increases. Sycophancy is when a model tends to agree with a human
regardless of the truth. Anthropic released great work recently that
showed larger models are more sycophantic. However, recent experiments
show that OpenAI models don‚Äôt suffer from this same problem.
