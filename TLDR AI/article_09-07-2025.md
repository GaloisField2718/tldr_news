 PEOPLE ARE USING AI CHATBOTS TO GUIDE THEIR PSYCHEDELIC TRIPS (13
MINUTE READ) [15]

cost thousands of dollars per session, gated by lengthy waiting lists.

Companies are following suit too: Mindbloom, for example, is already
integrating AI into its ketamine programs. Experts doubt that AI can
provide the emotional attunement they consider essential for safe
psychedelic experiences.
