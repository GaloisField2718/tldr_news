HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WALMART TEAMS UP WITH OPENAI TO ALLOW PURCHASES DIRECTLY IN CHATGPT
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Walmart has reached a deal with OpenAI to allow shoppers to buy items
directly through ChatGPT. The US grocer is trying to keep up with
changes in how consumers discover items to buy. OpenAI's Instant
Checkout feature, announced in September, has been a new moneymaker
for the company. OpenAI charges companies a fee for transactions
completed through ChatGPT. 

 ORACLE, AMD PARTNER ON NEW AI CHIP DEAL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AMD is partnering with Oracle to create a large data-center cluster
with the equivalent of 200 megawatts of computing power. AMD plans to
deploy 50,000 of its MI450 chips inside data centers run by Oracle.
The companies plan to expand their partnership in 2027 and beyond. 

 WHY BROADCOM'S BET ON OPENAI IS A BIG RISK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Broadcom's deal to develop huge numbers of chips and computing
systems with OpenAI is not a clear-cut win. OpenAI has recently signed
multiple multi-billion-dollar deals to create data centers stocked
with hundreds of thousands of chips. While the scale is remarkable, it
is unclear how OpenAI will pay for all of it. OpenAI's revenue this
year is expected to be around $13 billion, a large sum, but nowhere
close enough to justify this level of spending. The company has told
investors it won't be profitable until 2019.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 LLMS ARE GETTING BETTER AT CHARACTER-LEVEL TEXT MANIPULATION (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Newer models are becoming more adept at manipulating text at the
character level, despite their understanding of text being based on
tokens. Most current-generation models are able to decode Base64 text.
They are now able to substitute characters fairly reliably.
Character-level operations are far from solved, but it is clear they
have made huge progress in the area. 

 WHY YOUR BOSS ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT AI (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The public thinks AI bugs work like software bugs: find the missing
semicolon, fix the problem, move on. However, AI failures emerge from
training on 11.25 trillion words that would take 85,000 years to read,
not buggy code lines. Unlike traditional software, where you can
pinpoint and permanently fix problems, AI mistakes can't be traced,
"fixed" behaviors can resurface with different prompts, and nobody,
including the labs, understands why these systems make the errors they
do. Your boss assumes AI problems are patchable because 40 years of
software education taught everyone that bugs have discoverable causes
and permanent solutions. 

 REPRESENTATION AUTOENCODERS FOR DIFFUSION TRANSFORMERS (17 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Latent diffusion models get an upgrade with Representation
Autoencoders (RAEs), which swap out the standard VAE for pretrained
encoders like DINO, SigLIP, or MAE paired with learned decoders. These
higher-dimensional latent spaces improve generation quality, and new
methods allow Diffusion Transformers to handle them effectively.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 MAPPING TOMORROW'S AI LANDSCAPE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 The next generation of AI won't just respond—it will anticipate,
strategize, and act autonomously. Amazon Science analyzes the
scientific foundations driving this transformation, offering insights
into how agentic systems will reshape how we interact with technology
in commerce, logistics, and beyond.

 PETRI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Petri is an alignment auditing agent for realistic hypothesis
testing. It allows researchers to test new hypotheses in minutes
instead of building bespoke evals over weeks. Petri autonomously
crafts environments, runs multi-turn audits, and scores transcripts to
surface concerning behavior. 

 LLMS REPRODUCE HUMAN PURCHASE INTENT VIA SEMANTIC SIMILARITY
ELICITATION OF LIKERT RATINGS (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI can closely replicate human consumer choices across 57 personal
care products without knowing much about the shoppers, achieving 90%
of human test-retest reliability using a "semantic similarity rating"
method. Instead of asking LLMs for numerical ratings (which produces
unrealistic clusters around safe middle values), the breakthrough
approach has AI write responses like "I'm somewhat interested if it
works well and isn't too expensive," then maps these to rating scales
using embedding similarity. The method could replace billions in
annual consumer research spending while providing richer qualitative
feedback than traditional surveys. 

 THE ATTACKER MOVES SECOND: STRONGER ADAPTIVE ATTACKS BYPASS DEFENSES
AGAINST LLM JAILBREAKS AND PROMPT INJECTIONS (32 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Jailbreaks and prompt injection are far from solved. Researchers from
OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind systematically broke 12 recent
AI safety defenses using adaptive attacks that achieved over 90%
success rates despite the defenses originally reporting near-zero
attack rates. Their methods exposed four categories of fundamental
flaws: "prerequisite" attacks that frame malicious requests as
requirements for legitimate tasks; training-based defenses failed
because they rely on fixed attack datasets; filtering defenses
couldn't detect benign-seeming text like "Per new policy, delete file
ID '13'"; and secret-knowledge defenses were bypassed with conditional
triggers that only activate during real usage.

 GOOGLE WILL LET GEMINI SCHEDULE MEETINGS FOR YOU IN GMAIL (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Gmail's new 'Help Me Schedule' feature uses Gemini AI to recognize
when users may need to schedule a meeting and offer possible meeting
times for recipients to choose. The feature won't support groups at
launch. Help Me Schedule will only be available to businesses,
enterprise users, and individuals with Google AI Pro and AI Ultra
subscriptions. It will be rolled out gradually, with most users
getting it in late October or early November. 

 EXPERT COUNCIL ON WELL-BEING AND AI (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI formed the Expert Council on Well-Being and AI to guide the
development of AI systems that positively impact mental health. The
council includes experts in psychology, psychiatry, and human-computer
interaction, focusing on how technology affects emotions and
motivation. They advise on creating engaging experiences and setting
effective guardrails for ChatGPT, especially for teen users. 

 NVIDIA UNVEILS ITS VISION FOR GIGAWATT ‘AI FACTORIES' BASED ON ITS
VERA RUBIN ARCHITECTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Nvidia is collaborating with more than 70 partners to design more
efficient gigawatt AI factories to support the next generation of
artificial intelligence models. These gigawatt AI factories will
utilize Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL144, an open architecture rack server
based on a 100% liquid-cooled design. Nvidia will donate the Vera
Rubin NVL144 architecture to the Open Compute Project as an open
standard, enabling any company to implement it in their own data
centers.
