 IS THERE A SUSTAINABLE WAY TO MONETIZE AI? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You've built something powerful with AI. Now you're asking: how do we
price it? Many startups are getting the answer wrong right now—and
putting their business's viability at risk.

In Metronome's upcoming webinar [4], pricing experts from 49 Palms
Ventures and Metronome CEO Scott Woody will explore strategies and
best practices for monetizing AI. Learn how to:

→ Find a logical starting point with the 9-step AI pricing framework

→ Assess and communicate your AI product's value

→ Create flexible, iterable pricing systems that can evolve with the
market

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EFFICIENT LINE ART COLORIZATION WITH BROADER REFERENCES (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Novel efficient long-context fine-grained ID preservation framework
for line art colorization, achieving high precision, efficiency, and
flexible usability for comic colorization. It transforms
black-and-white line art into vibrant illustrations by effectively
integrating extensive contextual references. 

 SCENE CAPTIONING (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 3D CoCa is a unified framework that combines vision-language
contrastive learning and captioning for 3D scenes. 

 LARGE REASONING MODELS AS A JUDGE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 JudgeLRM is a family of LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for
judgment tasks. Unlike SFT, it excels in reasoning-heavy evaluations,
outperforming models like GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DEEPSPEED'S DEEPCOMPILE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The DeepSpeed team has worked to bring compilation to their
distributed training efforts. This compilation speeds up various
bottlenecked operations by many times. It makes use of a patched
version of torch compile. 

 SPEECH INSTRUCTION FINE-TUNING DATASET (HUGGING FACE HUB) [12] 

 SIFT-50M (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning) is a 50-million-example
dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of
speech-text large language models (LLMs). It is built from publicly
available speech corpora containing a total of 14K hours of speech and
leverages LLMs and off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five
languages, covering diverse aspects of speech understanding and
controllable speech generation instructions. SIFT-50M augments
existing speech datasets with instruction-based question-answer (QA)
pairs for speech understanding and includes approximately 5 million
examples for controllable speech generation. 

 END-TO-END LATENT DIFFUSION TRAINING WITH REPA-E (3 MINUTE READ) [13]


 REPA-E enables stable, joint training of VAEs and latent diffusion
models using a representation-alignment loss, achieving
state-of-the-art results on ImageNet. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 META RELEASES MANY NEW ARTIFACTS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta has released an image Encoder, a VLM, a 3D object localization
model based on JEPA, and weights for a BLT model that operates
directly on bytes without tokenization. 

 HUGGING FACE INFERENCE SUPPORTS COHERE MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cohere became the first model creator to directly host and serve its
enterprise-focused AI models on Hugging Face. 

 CREATE AI-GENERATED SOUNDTRACK IN SHORTS WITH DREAM TRACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 YouTube's Dream Track is now available in the U.S. on YouTube Shorts
and the YouTube Create app, enabling AI-generated instrumental
soundtracks for content creators. These tracks can be remixed globally
