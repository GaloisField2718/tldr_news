If you're an investor, you should be asking how AI is going to impact
your portfolio.¬†
If you aren't sure, we have a solution: Fundrise just launched
a¬†first-of-its-kind venture capital product
[https://fundrise.com/campaigns/invest-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=newsletter-tldr-2023&utm_content=AI]¬†investing
in top private, pre-IPO companies, including those leading the AI
revolution.¬†

Before, it would've been virtually impossible for you to invest in
these kinds of companies before they went public. Now you can invest
in the next generation of industry-shaping, high-growth tech
companies.¬†

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

3 TRILLION OPEN TOKEN DATASET RELEASED (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.allenai.org/dolma-3-trillion-tokens-open-llm-corpus-9a0ff4b8da64?utm_source=tldrai]

There are many open datasets, but few of sufficient scale to train a
frontier model. The Allen Institute for AI‚Äôs Dolma dataset aims to
enable researchers to study data effects at scale. 

OPENAI‚ÄôS CONTENT MODERATION (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/using-gpt-4-for-content-moderation/?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI proposes using GPT-4 for content policy development and content
moderation decisions across digital platforms, taking the burden away
from humans and allowing more consistent labeling of content and
faster feedback loops. This begs the question, should AI be the
authority on who can say what?

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

SIGMOID LOSS FOR LANGUAGE IMAGE PRETRAINING (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343?utm_source=tldrai]

CLIP was somewhat revolutionary for computer vision. It has some
extremely clever algorithmic tricks (e.g., large in-batch negatives)
that make it perform well. This paper questions many of those tricks
and finds a simpler training setup that outperforms CLIP for the same
task. 

AN EFFICIENT WAY TO EVALUATE TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATIONS (17 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08525v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Current methods for judging the quality of images created from text
have some problems, like not truly capturing how good the image looks
or how well it matches the text. This paper introduces a new method
that estimates how likely a created image matches a given text,
focusing on the most important parts of the image. It does this
efficiently with fewer samples. 

IMPROVING 3D DETECTION IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08140v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Detecting objects in 3D using LiDAR has challenges when moving to new
places because of differences in how data looks. This new method,
GPA-3D, uses special reference points to understand 3D shapes better
and helps the detector to work well even in unfamiliar areas.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

RL ENVIRONMENT FOR ROBOT PIANIST (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/kevinzakka/robopianist-rl?utm_source=tldrai]

The robot pianist was an amazing project whereby an agent learned to
control a robot hand that played classical piano songs. It is now open
sourced for you to train our own. 

CODE FOR BAYESIAN FLOW NETWORKS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Algomancer/Bayesian-Flow-Networks?utm_source=tldrai]

Bayesian Flow Networks are an exciting new architecture and training
algorithm. This is a simple, unofficial, reproduction of the paper.
The goal is to build a codebase that can scale to GPT-2 sized models.

txtai is an all-in-one embeddings database for semantic search, LLM
orchestration, and language model workflows.

It's hard to know what is real in the current AI kerfuffle. This list
contains foundational papers, interesting open questions, and a guide
for gaining deeper insights into the space. 

YOU PROBABLY DON‚ÄôT NEED TO FINE TUNE AN LLM (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.tidepool.so/2023/08/17/why-you-probably-dont-need-to-fine-tune-an-llm/?utm_source=tldrai]

Fine-tuning is often not necessary for most LLM applications. It may
be better to use few-shot prompting or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) instead. Few-shot prompting involves providing the LLM with
examples of the desired output, while RAG involves querying a vector
database for information that the LLM was not trained on. 

GOOGLE‚ÄôS PROJECT IDX (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/google-launches-project-idx-a-new-ai-enabled-browser-based-development-environment/?utm_source=tldrai]

An AI-enabled browser-based development environment for building
full-stack web and multiplatform apps.
