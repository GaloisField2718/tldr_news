HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AI LEGAL STARTUP HARVEY RAISES $80M SERIES B (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Harvey AI, a legal service built on OpenAI technology, has raised
another round of funding which values the young company at over $700m.
The startup builds foundation models with OpenAI for law and legal
practice applications. 

 CONTROVERSIAL AI HACKING COMPANY LAUNCHED (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new company, whiterabbitneo, a reference to the Matrix, has
released a 13B parameter language model trained for both offensive and
defensive cyber security. It is trained to answer questions and
provide information about computer security. 

 ANTHROPIC UPDATES TERMS OF SERVICE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic updated ownership of output language in its usage terms.
Also, it claims it will defend its customers in court over copyright
claims against anthropic-generated output.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS VIDEOPOET (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VideoPoet, a groundbreaking language model, is revolutionizing video
creation with its unique ability to handle various tasks like
text-to-video, video stylization, and even video-to-audio conversion.
This approach stands out by combining multiple video generation
techniques into one model. 

 DEEPFAKE DETECTION USING CNNS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study presents a deep learning method for identifying deepfake
faces in videos utilizing four pre-trained CNN models for high
accuracy. 

 A NOVEL MULTI-MODAL MODEL FOR OBJECT TRACKING (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Introducing a multi-modal visual prompt tracking model, this project
overcomes the limitations of single-modal object tracking by
dynamically harnessing the strengths of various modalities like RGB
and infrared.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SAVE UP TO 90% ON EVERY FLIGHT FOR LIFE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 For the next 12 hours, get 93% off Dollar Flight Club‚Äôs lifetime
membership for $129 (normally $1,690) and try it risk-free (3-day
money-back guarantee). Fly roundtrip to Paris from $299, Hawaii from
$161, and more dream destinations discounted up to 90%. Start
Exploring with $1500 off now [11]. 

 LLMLINGUA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LLMLingua uses a well-trained small language model after alignment to
detect unimportant tokens in a prompt and enable inference with the
compressed prompt in black-box LLMs, achieving up to 20x compression
with minimal performance loss. 

 ENHANCED REAL-TIME RENDERING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project introduces Space-time Supersampling (STSS), a framework
that significantly improves high-resolution, high-frame-rate content
in real-time rendering. 

 DISTIL WHISPER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Distil-Whisper is a distilled version of Whisper that is 6 times
faster, 49% smaller, and performs within 1% WER on out-of-distribution
evaluation sets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A COMPREHENSIVE 3D INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING DATASET (4 MINUTE READ) [15]


 M3DBench, a new extensive dataset, is set to transform 3D
understanding in AI, bridging the gap in multimodal language model
research. It features over 320,000 diverse instruction-response pairs,
integrating text, images, and 3D objects, paving the way for AI to
perform a broader range of real-world 3D tasks. 

 PILOTLESS FEDEX, RELIABLE ROBOTICS PLANE COMPLETES FLIGHT (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Reliable Robotics Corp. has flown a small cargo plane without a human
on board. The 12-minute flight, made with a plane on loan from FedEx,
was Reliable Robotics' second automated flight. The startup is working
to gain full approval from the FAA. Its system will restrict remote
pilots to only supervising one aircraft at a time rather than managing
multiple autonomous flights. Remote piloting will boost efficiency and
allow planes to be repositioned more easily to match where demand is
strongest. 

 TOKENIZE ANYTHING (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This new model surpasses previous capabilities by simultaneously
performing image segmentation, recognition, and captioning.
