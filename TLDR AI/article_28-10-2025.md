 THE CODING PERSONALITIES OF LEADING LLMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Think the newest LLM is the best for coding? Despite their shared
strengths and flaws, each LLM has a unique and inherent style—a
measurable “coding personality” that drives their distinct
results.

Sonar put GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Llama 3 models to the test in
their latest State of Code report - and found some surprising results
[4]. Read it to discover:

 	* The shared strengths and flaws of LLMs
 	* Coding archetypes for the leading LLMs 
 	* Hidden quality & security risks of using LLMs for code generation
 	* How to select the best model for your needs

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ADVANCING CLAUDE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic is continuing its push into financial services by launching
Claude for Excel, which lets users analyze and modify spreadsheets by
chatting with Claude in a sidebar. It is currently in beta behind a
waitlist. 

 THE AI STARTUP FUELING CHATGPT'S EXPERTISE IS NOW VALUED AT $10
BILLION (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mercor, a human resources and recruiting startup, has finalized a new
funding deal that values the company at $10 billion. The company
manages 30,000 contractors around the world who help AI chatbots learn
how to think and speak like humans. Venture capital firms are eager to
offer funding to founders at sky-high valuations because they fear
missing out on the next AI tech giant. Mercor is currently being sued
by Scale for allegedly stealing trade secrets.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SPEEDRUNNING AN RL ENVIRONMENT (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 RL environments can be surprisingly complex and fun to create. This
post explains what RL environments are, introduces the 'verifiers'
framework, and also walks readers through how to create an environment
for a benchmark called AgentDojo. RL environments are scenarios that
LLMs operate in for evaluation or training. Designing them means
essentially defining the maze, the rewards, and how the LLM navigates
through it. 

 AI DISCOVERS NOVEL CANCER DRUG, OR DID IT? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google recently published an announcement that its Gemma model had
discovered a new potential cancer pathway. It's important to note that
the model didn't invent or theorize a method to discover potential
drug candidates - the entire construction of the experiment was
imagined and executed by humans. The model was used to
probabilistically narrow a set of potential candidates to a manageable
set that could be inspected by human review. Humans still possess a
reasoning capability that is not present in any current AI system.

Discovery Guide [9]. 

 TOKEN-ORIENTED OBJECT NOTATION (TOON) (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 TOON is a compact, human-readable format designed for LLM input that
allows developers to pass structured data to LLMs with significantly
reduced token usage. It excels at uniform complex objects. Standard
JSON is verbose and token-expensive - TOON conveys the same
information with fewer tokens. In benchmark tests, TOON achieves
higher accuracy compared to JSON while using significantly fewer
tokens. 

 ON-POLICY DISTILLATION (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Thinking Machines Lab demonstrated that training smaller AI models by
having them learn from their own mistakes, by grading them with a
larger teacher model, achieves the same reasoning performance as RL at
9-30x lower cost. "On-policy distillation" combines the relevance of
learning from your own outputs with the dense feedback of traditional
distillation, reaching 70% on AIME'24 math problems in just 150
training steps compared to 17,920 GPU hours of RL. 

 REASONING WITH SAMPLING (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new sampling method enables base models to reach single-shot
reasoning performance comparable to reinforcement learning, without
retraining or external verifiers, while maintaining diversity and
multi-shot accuracy.

 QUALCOMM ANNOUNCES NEW AI CHIPS IN DATA CENTER PUSH, SHARES SURGE (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The smartphone chipmaker's new AI200 and AI250 inference
accelerators—shipping in 2026 and 2027—sent shares up 20% on the
promise of diversification beyond a stagnating mobile market. Saudi
Arabia's Humain is committed to purchasing roughly $2 billion worth of
the chips starting next year. 

 MINIMAX M2 (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Chinese Lab MiniMax open-sourced M2, a 230B parameter model with 10B
active that ranks #1 among open-source models on Artificial Analysis'
composite intelligence score. It slightly outperforms the previous
generation Claude Sonnet model on coding benchmarks at less than 10%
of the cost.
