AWS PARTNERS WITH HUGGING FACE FOR NEXT GENERATION BLOOM AND CHATGPT
RIVAL TRAINING (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-21/amazon-s-aws-joins-with-ai-startup-hugging-face-as-chatgpt-competition-heats-up?utm_source=tldrai]

Custom model that can be used to answer business specific queries. It
combines OpenAI‚Äôs industry-leading artificial intelligence tools and
platforms and Bain‚Äôs strategic guidance and digital implementation
capabilities, helping companies harness the power of generative AI to
transform their business. 

AI AND THE INSTAGRAM PROBLEM: DON'T LET THE SHINY OBJECTS MAKE YOU
DOUBT THE WORTH OF YOUR WORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-184/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This article discusses how the prevalence of impressive AI projects on
social media platforms like Instagram can make other developers feel
inadequate about their own work. The author encourages AI developers
to judge their projects based on their own standards and not to be
swayed by what's currently trendy. The field of AI is constantly
evolving, with new technologies emerging all the time, and it's
important to keep learning and stay up to date. The article reminds
developers that the emergence of a new hot technology doesn't mean
their current project is any less valuable.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

TALKING ABOUT LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551?utm_source=tldrai] 

Technology and Philosophy have found a fun intersection with Large
Language Models (LLMs). We often use anthropomorphising words such as
‚Äúknows‚Äù, ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù, or ‚Äúbelieves‚Äù when referring to
these systems. This paper advocates the community to take care when
talking about these extremely capable systems and use more fitting
language (e.g., encodes, stores, contains). 

ENCODING IMAGES IN TEXT, UNSUPERVISED TEXT-IMAGE ALIGNMENT (32 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00902?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces LQAE which uses a pre-trained language model and
encodes images as a sequence of text tokens, then they train a decoder
with the BERT masking objective which learns to represent similar
images with similar clusters of text tokens. They train the decoder to
reconstruct the original image from the predicted text token
embeddings. This serves to align the two modalities in an unsupervised
manner. A fun side effect is the ability to compress images as text
(just a few kb) and reconstruct a lossy version via a single forward
pass. 

PIX2PIX3D: 3D-AWARE CONDITIONAL IMAGE SYNTHESIS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/dunbar12138/pix2pix3D?utm_source=tldrai] 

This work proposes pix2pix3D, a 3D-aware conditional generative model
for controllable photorealistic image synthesis. Given a 2D label map,
such as a segmentation or edge map, the model learns to synthesize a
corresponding image from different viewpoints. To enable explicit 3D
user control, the authors extend conditional generative models with
neural radiance fields. Given widely-available monocular images and
label map pairs, the model learns to assign a label to every 3D point
in addition to color and density, which enables it to render the image
and pixel-aligned label map simultaneously.

TURN YOUR DATAFRAME INTO A UI FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker?utm_source=tldrai] 

PyGWalker (pronounced Pig Walker) is a graphical tool for exploratory
analysis of your data. It allows you to quickly inspect relationships,
correlations, and distributions. Examples and screenshots are
available in the repository readme. 

UNIVERSAL AUDIO SYNTHESIS MODEL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/NVIDIA/BigVGAN?utm_source=tldrai] 

Universal vocoder for generating high fidelity audio with the ability
to condition on specific features. This is the first large scale GAN
model of its kind. Models, code, and samples are available. 

CONTROLNET: A NEURAL NETWORK STRUCTURE TO CONTROL DIFFUSION MODELS BY
ADDING EXTRA CONDITIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have introduced a neural network structure called
ControlNet, which can control pretrained large diffusion models to
support additional input conditions. This new method allows for
task-specific learning in an end-to-end fashion and is capable of
learning with a small training dataset. The training is as fast as
fine-tuning a diffusion model and can be done on a personal device, or
it can scale to large amounts of data using powerful computation
clusters. The researchers demonstrate that ControlNets can enable
conditional inputs such as edge maps, segmentation maps, and key
points for large diffusion models, which can benefit various related
applications. 

BIOGPT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/microsoft/BioGPT?utm_source=tldrai] 

This GitHub repository contains the implementation of BioGPT, a
generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and
mining. It outperforms GPT-3 with just a fraction of the parameters.

TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE MODELS, WE MUST SEPARATE ‚ÄúLANGUAGE‚Äù FROM
‚ÄúTHOUGHT‚Äù (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://bdtechtalks.com/2023/02/20/llm-dissociating-language-and-thought/?utm_source=tldrai]


The researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and MIT have
written a paper that delves into the confusion surrounding Large
Language Models (LLMs). They argue that to understand the power and
limits of LLMs, we must distinguish between formal and functional
linguistic competence. They highlight the fallacies surrounding LLMs
and state that LLMs are good at language but still have a lot of work
to do on the functional aspect of language. They suggest that avoiding
these fallacies could help in finding ways to build models that
understand and use language in human-like ways.
