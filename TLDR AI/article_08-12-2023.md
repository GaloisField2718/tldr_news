 Purple Llama, a new project aiming to level the playing field for
building safe and responsible generative AI experiences, is launching
with permissively licensed tools, evaluations, and models for both
research and commercial use. Initial offerings include CyberSecEval
for assessing AI system security, the Llama Guard model for detecting
and preventing cyberattacks, and tools for insecure code detection and
cyber attack compliance testing. This initiative democratizes access
to essential resources, empowering developers to create secure and
responsible AI experiences.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LONG CONTEXT PROMPTING FOR CLAUDE (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The recent release of Claude from Anthropic had 200k tokens in
context. It seemed to suffer from the ‚Äúlost in the middle‚Äù problem
of language models in external evals, meaning it only had 27%
retrieval performance on some standard problems. However, if you add
the sentence ‚ÄúAssistant: Here is the most relevant sentence in the
context‚Äù to the prompt the retrieval performance jumps to 98%. 

 ONELLM: A MULTIMODAL AI THAT UNDERSTANDS EIGHT DIFFERENT MODALITIES
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new AI model called OneLLM is making waves by understanding eight
different types of data, including images, audio, and even brain
activity, using a unique method that aligns all these modalities to
language. 

 KANDINSKY 3.0: TEXT-TO-IMAGE WITH ENHANCED QUALITY AND REALISM (4
MINUTE READ) [10]

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS BEST GEMINI DEMO WAS FAKED (3 MINUTE READ) [19]
