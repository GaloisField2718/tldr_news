 STOP READING TRANSCRIPTS. START LISTENING WITH ELMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Voice is multi-dimensional. Tone and timing can change the meaning of
a conversation and transcript-reliant LLMs miss it all.

So meet Ensemble Listening Models [5](ELMs), a new AI architecture
built by Modulate, that orchestrates 100+ voice-specific models to
better understand conversations. Modulate's ELM, Velma [4], is now
publicly available so you can harness human-level, real-time voice
intelligence.

4 benefits of using Velma:

 	* Decode intent, emotion, stress, and authenticity in messy,
multilingual audio.
 	* 100x faster, cheaper, and more accurate than LLMs.
 	* Traceable outputs with an explainable path. No black box, just
evidence you can trust.
 	* Placed #1 on benchmarks for contextual understanding.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC WORKS ON KNOWLEDGE BASES FOR CLAUDE COWORK (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Knowledge bases are persistent repositories that Claude can reference
for relevant context and incrementally update with new information.
They allow Claude to segment information into multiple, user-managed
knowledge bases. Users will likely be able to select specific
knowledge bases as context attachments when working on tasks in
Cowork. The feature could be particularly relevant for workflows that
involve automation and file management. 

 GOOGLE STITCH TO ADD API KEYS AND PRD GENERATION FOR PMS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Google Stitch will soon allow API key management and automatic PRD
generation. The update aim to enhance design workflows by integrating
Gemini models for high-resolution outputs and simplifying project
documentation. This positions Stitch as a vital tool in Google's
AI-driven development strategy, enhancing collaboration within product
teams.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE ASSISTANT AXIS: SITUATING AND STABILIZING THE CHARACTER OF LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Two components are important to shaping model character: persona
construction and persona stabilization. Without the proper
construction, assistants can easily inherit counterproductive
associations from the wrong sources. Even when assistants are
well-constructed, they easily drift away from their roles, which makes
stabilizing and preserving models' personas particularly important.
Ensuring models are aligned will become increasingly important as they
become more capable and are deployed in increasingly sensitive
environments. 

 SLONK: CHARACTER.AI INTERNAL SYSTEM (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Character.ai uses an internal system called "Slonk" to manage GPU
research clusters. Slonk merges the flexibility of Kubernetes with the
productivity of HPC environments to optimize ML research workflows. 

 TRAINING CLI AGENTS WITH SYNTHETIC DATA AND RL (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Nvidia showcases how a reasoning model with no prior knowledge can be
taught to safely use the LangGraph CLI for complex tasks like spinning
up servers and building Docker containers, using synthetic data, and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OWASP TOP 10 FOR AGENTIC APPLICATIONS?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Here's where you get answers: Zenity is hosting a live AMA [11] on
Wed. 1/28 with the security researchers (Chris Hughes, Steve Wilson,
Michael Bargury, and Kayla Underkoffler) who helped write the
industry's first peer-reviewed risk framework for autonomous AI agents
-- including contributors who led entries on goal hijacking, tool
misuse, and memory poisoning. Bring your hardest questions about
securing agents in production. Register now → [11] 

 META'S 3D SHAPE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ShapeR reconstructs full-scene 3D meshes from image sequences by
extracting multimodal features and feeding them into a flow
transformer that generates object-specific shape codes. 

 NATURAL LANGUAGE TO SOLVER-READY CODE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Microsoft's OptiMind translates natural language optimization
problems into mathematical formulations. It was designed to streamline
the traditionally slow and expert-heavy modeling step in optimization
workflows. 

 SKYPILOT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 skypilot is a unified open-source framework for running, managing,
and scaling AI/ML workloads across clouds, Kubernetes, and on-prem
infrastructure with a simple interface and intelligent scheduling. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 KAGGLE COMMUNITY BENCHMARKS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Kaggle has launched Community Benchmarks, a feature that allows users
to collaboratively build and share custom model evaluations that go
beyond static accuracy metrics to better reflect real-world AI
performance. 

 AI ENGINEERING HAS A RUNTIME PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI teams struggle to deploy agents because no standardized runtime
exists to handle state, streaming, isolation, recovery, and scaling
across sessions and users. Existing frameworks, observability, and
eval tools only cover building and testing agents, leaving each team
to reinvent complex infrastructure from scratch. A proper runtime
would serve agents as APIs, persist state, manage streams, recover
from failures, and scale safely, turning notebooks into
production-ready AI applications.
