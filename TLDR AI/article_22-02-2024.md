 FREE COURSE: GROUNDING LLMS WITH GRAPH DATABASES (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Have you been looking for a better way to ground your LLM app to
avoid hallucination?
In this free 4-hour course [5], you will learn how to:

ü§ñ Integrate the graph database with your GenAI model using
Langchain

‚úÖ Ground your LLM-generated content with RAG

üîé Perform similarity and keyword searches [5] using vector and full
text indexes

üõ†Ô∏è Use Langchain and Python to interact with ChatGPT

Do it at your own pace or all at once. But don't wait too long ‚Äì
GenAI is moving fast these days üöÄ

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND OPEN SOURCES GEMMA BASED ON GEMINI (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google has released the weights for its Gemma 2B and 7B parameter
models, available via HuggingFace. The models are decoder-only
Transformers trained on 2T and 6T tokens. They substantially
outperform Llama 2 on a wide range of benchmarks and come in base and
instruction-tuned versions. 

 HELM INSTRUCT BENCHMARK (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The language modeling group at Stanford released a widely used
benchmark called Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM). They
also released a version for instruction following called
HELM-Instruct. It is multidimensional, open-ended, and absolute. 

 REDDIT HAS A NEW AI TRAINING DEAL TO SELL USER CONTENT (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Reddit has entered a licensing agreement worth approximately $60
million annually with an unnamed major AI company, granting the
company access to its vast user-generated content.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 25+ LORAS FOR MISTRAL THAT OUTPERFORM GPT-4 (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Predibase released 25 narrow task-specific LoRAs that each outperform
GPT-4 on specific tasks. These task-specific LoRAs are built onto the
Mistral 7B model. This is another piece of evidence to support the
ability of local models to perform exceptionally well on exact tasks. 

 MULTIMODAL LLM‚ÄôS ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND VISUAL DATA (GITHUB REPO)
[10] 

 ChartX is a new tool for testing multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) on their ability to interpret and reason with visual charts. 

 COMBINING UNSUPERVISED TRAINING AND SUPERVISED FINE-TUNING (GITHUB
REPO) [11] 

 This repo challenges the effectiveness of combining supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in training. Using a more
advanced model like GPT-4 for initial training can outperform the more
complex two-step method.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MULTIMODAL CONVERSATIONS DATASET (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Meta has released the MMCSG dataset, which has thousands of two-sided
conversations recorded via the Aria glasses, to encourage research in
various social audio and visual tasks. 

 MULTILORA INFERENCE SERVER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Lorax is an inference server that supports hot-swapping LoRAs onto a
single base model. This means a dramatic decrease in RAM while
supporting a wide range of model tunes. 

 EVALUATING LLMS IN GAMES (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project introduces GTBench, a platform for testing LLMs like
GPT-4 in various game scenarios to discover their strengths and
weaknesses in strategic reasoning. While these models show promise in
games based on probability, they struggle in deterministic games and
vary in performance based on their design and training.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MULTIVIEW DIFFUSION++ (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A diffusion model that can generate multiple views of an object and
then stitch them together into a compelling 3D version. 

 THIS IS WHY THE IDEA THAT AI WILL JUST AUGMENT JOBS, NEVER REPLACE
THEM, IS A LIE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI is going to automate parts of the workforce. The reaction so far
has been two-sided ‚Äì will this efficiency mean the same humans can
do more or will fewer humans do the same tasks? This article explores
comparisons between the impact of tech on manufacturing and
agriculture and what we‚Äôre seeing today with the modern knowledge
worker. 

 MULTIMODAL DIALOGUE (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 ChatterBox is a vision-language model that excels in multimodal
dialogues, specifically in the newly established task of multimodal
multi-round referring and grounding.
