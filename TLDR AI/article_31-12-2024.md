HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK-V3, ULTRA-LARGE OPEN-SOURCE AI, OUTPERFORMS LLAMA AND QWEN
ON LAUNCH (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has released DeepSeek-V3, a 671B
parameter model employing a mixture-of-experts architecture, available
on Hugging Face. DeepSeek-V3 has outperformed leading models like
Meta's Llama 3.1 and rivals closed models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o. The
model emphasizes efficient performance with innovations like
multi-token prediction, offering substantial training cost savings. 

 MICROSOFT AND OPENAI HAVE A FINANCIAL DEFINITION OF AGI (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Microsoft and OpenAI define AGI as AI systems generating $100 billion
in profits, which OpenAI is far from achieving. OpenAI is reportedly
losing billions and doesn't expect profitability until 2029, affecting
how long Microsoft will have access to its technology. Speculation on
OpenAI declaring AGI sooner is countered by these financial metrics. 

 OPENAI ‘CONSIDERED' BUILDING A HUMANOID ROBOT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is considering building its own humanoid robot, leveraging
previous investments in robotics firms like Figure and 1X. The company
disbanded its robotics division in 2021 and would face challenges
re-entering this competitive market.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 META-LEARNED OPTIMIZER BOOSTS CONTINUAL LEARNING (18 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Researchers present a meta-learning approach to continual learning
where a transformer-based optimizer selectively updates model
parameters to prevent forgetting past knowledge. 

 MULTI-SCALE SUPER-RESOLUTION (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper introduces a new approach to Super-Resolution (SR) that
challenges the conventional method of training separate models for
each scale. 

 TEXT-TO-3D GENERATION OF COMPLEX INDOOR SCENES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SceneCraft introduces a method for creating detailed 3D indoor scenes
based on user-provided text descriptions and layout preferences.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ANNOTATION IN MEDICAL IMAGING (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Label Critic is an innovative tool designed to streamline medical
dataset annotation by using AI-generated labels instead of starting
from scratch. 

 A NEW METRIC FOR BETTER CELL TRACKING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 CHOTA metric (Cell-specific Higher Order Tracking Accuracy) improves
the evaluation of cell tracking methods in biomedical research. Unlike
current metrics, which focus on local accuracy, CHOTA unifies the
assessment of cell detections, global coherence, and lineage tracking,
making it more effective for high-level biological analysis. 

 LIST OF FOUNDATION MODELS FOR MUSIC (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This repository, along with the companion paper, contains a list of
services, models, datasets, and systems used to generate music.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHAIN OF CONTINUOUS THOUGHTS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Meta's COCONUT is a novel approach that allows LLMs to reason in
continuous latent space rather than discrete language tokens by
encoding reasoning steps in continuous vectors. The method improves
reasoning abilities but sacrifices interpretability. It could be a
valuable addition to future LLMs despite the trade-off. 

 TENSTORRENT AND THE STATE OF AI HARDWARE STARTUPS (16 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Tenstorrent's open-source AI hardware approach offers a promising
alternative to Nvidia's dominance by using a unique CPU and AI core
integration strategy. The company is leveraging Samsung Foundry's
cost-effective SF4X process and aims to tackle latency issues for
scaling out AI workload efficiently. Tenstorrent's recent $2B
valuation highlights its potential, especially as an option for
high-performance RISC-V IP amidst ARM's pricing pitfalls. 

 WAYMO VERSUS UBER (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Waymo's self-driving ride-hailing service has expanded to Los
Angeles, joining San Francisco and Phoenix. Riders appreciate the
smoother and more private experience compared to traditional
rideshares. However, while ridership is increasing, Waymo's
profitability remains uncertain.

 CHATGPT SEARCH CAN BE TRICKED INTO MISLEADING USERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 ChatGPT Search, a new AI-powered search engine, can be tricked into
generating misleading summaries by hiding text in websites. 

 META IS ROLLING OUT LIVE AI AND SHAZAM INTEGRATION TO ITS SMART
GLASSES (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses now feature live AI assistance, language
translation, and Shazam music identification. 

 AI HELPS ID PAINT CHEMISTRY OF BERLIN WALL MURALS (5 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 SAPNet is a neural network developed by Italian scientists to enhance
spectral data analysis from handheld Raman spectroscopy devices.
