plans. 

COREWEAVE IS BATTLING THE GIANTS OF SILICON VALLEY (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/3pAwF?utm_source=tldrai] 

CoreWeave, a New Jersey-based startup, has emerged as a major player
in AI infrastructure, offering cloud services for powerful GPU-based
computing crucial for AI. Originally dabbling in cryptocurrency,

FLEXIBLE TECHNIQUES FOR RENDERING WITH 3D GAUSSIAN (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://leonidk.com/fmb-plus/?utm_source=tldrai] 

What do you get when you take a cell phone video and a few seconds on
a CPU? Well, in this case - state of the art shape reconstruction!
Slightly different from Gaussian splatting, but using the same
fundamental math, this technique is a cool step forward in accessible
3D shape capture. 

SIMPLIFYING MEMORY USE IN TRANSFER LEARNING (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14316?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have found a way to make transfer learning methods use
less memory with a new approach called "Universal Parallel Tuning"
(UniPT). This makes it easier to use these advanced methods in
everyday situations. 

ENHANCING SECURITY IN MODELS USING DIFFUSION (29 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14333v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers are exploring if "diffusion models" can make models that
are already trained to be robust even stronger. A new method,
"DiffSmooth", cleans up data using diffusion and then uses a special
smoothing process to make the models even more reliable.

ADAPTIVE COMPUTATION READING LIST (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/koayon/awesome-adaptive-computation?utm_source=tldrai]


Adaptive computation is the idea that a model can choose how much
computation (e.g. how many parameters to use) to use for a given task.
These can include search-based sampling methods or mixture of expert
models. This reading list is actively maintained and extremely
thorough. 

LANGFUSE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse?utm_source=tldrai] 

Langfuse is an open source observability & analytics solution for
LLM-based applications. It is mostly geared towards production usage
but some users also use it for local development of their LLM
applications. 

DSPY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy?utm_source=tldrai] 

DSPy unifies techniques for prompting and fine-tuning LMs as well as
improving them with reasoning and tool/retrieval augmentation, all
expressed through a minimalistic set of Pythonic modules that compose
and learn.

MULTI-TURN CHAT MODELS ARE HARD TO CHOOSE (HUGGING FACE MODEL)
[https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/codellama-13b-oasst-sft-v10?utm_source=tldrai]


Many benchmarks don't accurately capture the full capabilities of
language models. The unfortunate truth is model evaluation is
increasingly vibes-based. The community sentiment is that this open
assistant model is one of the best turn-based chat models available. 

LLAMA 2 IS AS ACCURATE AT SUMMARIZING ARTICLES AS GPT-4 (10 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.anyscale.com/blog/llama-2-is-about-as-factually-accurate-as-gpt-4-for-summaries-and-is-30x-cheaper?utm_source=tldrai]


Llama-2-70b has been found to be almost as strong at factuality as
GPT-4, and considerably better than gpt-3.5-turbo, all while being
significantly cheaper. 

AI IN EDUCATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.educationnext.org/a-i-in-education-leap-into-new-era-machine-intelligence-carries-risks-challenges-promises?utm_source=tldrai]


This article explores the potential of generative AI models like
ChatGPT to transform education through customized tutoring, adaptive
lessons, and administrative support. It discusses implications for
teaching and policy but stresses the need for human oversight to
maximize benefits and limit risks.
