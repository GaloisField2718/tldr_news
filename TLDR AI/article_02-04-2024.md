 NAVIGATING THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF SYNTHETIC VOICES (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI's Voice Engine is a model that generates speech mimicking a
speaker's voice from a 15-second audio sample. It can be used in
applications like educational aids, translation, and support for
non-verbal individuals. OpenAI is employing a cautious approach to
deployment due to potential misuse. 

 NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO SAFETY-TEST AI (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Beth Barnes' nonprofit METR is partnering with major AI companies
like OpenAI and Anthropic to develop safety tests for advanced AI
systems, a move echoed by government initiatives. The focus is on
assessing risks such as AI autonomy and self-replication, though
there's acknowledgment that safety evaluations are still in early
stages and cannot guarantee AI safety. METR's work is seen as
pragmatic, despite concerns that current tests may not be sufficiently
reliable to justify the rapid advancement of AI technologies. 

 APPLE RESEARCHERS BOAST ON-DEVICE MODEL THAT OUTPERFORMS GPT-4 (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's AI researchers have developed a new system called ReALM that
improves Siri's ability to understand context by considering
on-screen, conversational, and background entities. It outperforms
ChatGPT 4.0 in benchmarks.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TRANSFORMER-LITE: LLMS ON MOBILE PHONE GPUS (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Running language models on phones is challenging due to latency,
bandwidth, and power constraints. Using quantization, removal of the
kv cache, and other optimizations - this research shows how to get 30
tokens/second generation for the powerful Gemma 2B model, which is
approximately 3x faster than other frameworks. 

 UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM DETECTION IN VLMS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are times when Visual Language Models (VLMs) cannot answer a
query given an input image. This is a challenge even for
state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4V. This paper proposes a benchmark and
some potential improvements for VLMs faced with Unsolvable Problems. 

 3D SCENE EDITING WITH TOTAL-DECOM (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Total-Decom offers a breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction,
allowing for easy editing and manipulation by accurately decomposing
objects from multi-view images with minimal user effort.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 OPTIMUM-NVIDIA (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 An update to TensorRT from Nvidia achieves speeds up to 28x faster
than baseline. Llama 2 in particular can run at 1,200 tokens per
second in benchmarks. The update takes advantage of the new Hopper and
Ada chip architectures. 

 OPENUI (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Wandb has released a toolkit that allows you to describe a UI and
have it rendered in React, Svelte, etc. It allows for text-based
editing as well. The tool can be run locally with Ollama. 

 OPENCHAT GEMMA (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [12] 

 Gemma has been challenging to tune. This work from the OpenChat team
shows it is possible to match Mistral tune performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BEYOND RPA: HOW LLMS ARE USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF INTELLIGENT PROCESS
AUTOMATION (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Despite some early successes, RPA fell short of the enterprise-wide
deployments as promised. A Deloitte survey revealed that only 3% of
companies were able to successfully scale their RPA initiatives.
Recent advances in AI are poised to change this. LLMs‚Äô novel
capabilities prime the market opportunity for intelligent process
automation to grow by at least 10x in the coming decade. 

 WE‚ÄôRE FOCUSING ON THE WRONG KIND OF AI APOCALYPSE (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Discussions about AI's future often focus on extreme scenarios,
overlooking its immediate impact on jobs and misinformation. However,
with thoughtful integration, AI has the potential to transform work
into more meaningful and productive tasks rather than leading to
apocalyptic outcomes. 

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS GENERATIVE AI FOR BEGINNERS COURSE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Version 2 of Microsoft's popular course on LLMs, vector databases,
prompting, and low code applications is on GitHub. It contains 18
lessons. Some of the content is aspirational, but it is still a good
resource for getting started in the space.

 BEZI AI ENABLES GENERATIVE AI-BASED 3D DESIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A significant milestone in the world of 3D design: the ability to
ideate at the speed of thought with an infinite asset library. 

 ROBOT, CAN YOU SAY ‚ÄòCHEESE‚Äô? (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Emo is a robot capable of anticipating and mimicking human facial
expressions in real-time in a way that significantly enhances
human-robot interaction, paving the way for future applications in
assistance, education, and companionship. 

 YOU CAN NOW USE CHATGPT WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI has made ChatGPT accessible without an account, with
additional safeguards for accountless users and options to opt out of
data training, aiming to attract more users to its platform to widen
AI's benefits and gather more training data.
