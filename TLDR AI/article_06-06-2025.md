 [RESEARCH] ZERO-SHOT AUTO-LABELING THAT'S 100,000X CHEAPER AND 5,000X
FASTER WITH NEAR-HUMAN PERFORMANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual labeling has long been the most burdensome task in computer
vision development.

Voxel51's latest ML research dives into the parameters, confidence
thresholds, and configurations that unlock auto-labeling performance.
These benchmarks show that zero-shot labeling with foundational models
like YOLO-World and Grounding DINO achieves 95% OF HUMAN PERFORMANCE,
at 100,000√ó LOWER COST and 5,000√ó FASTER SPEED.

The $ difference: a human annotation service labeling 1.2 million
objects would take ~2,470 hours and cost $45,725, versus 27 minutes
and $0.42 with¬†Voxel51's Verified Auto Labeling [5]¬†‚Äî with similar
or better model mAP scores.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI 2.5 PRO GETS AN UPGRADE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The updated preview leads all models on several major benchmarks
(GPQA, Aider, and LMArena) and addresses regressions in formatting and
creativity from the previous 2.5 Pro update. 

 ELEVEN V3: MOST EXPRESSIVE AI TEXT-TO-SPEECH MODEL LAUNCHED (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Eleven Labs has launched Eleven v3, an AI text-to-speech model
recognized for its expressiveness. It supports a wide range of
languages, including Afrikaans, Arabic, French, and Mandarin. This
advancement enhances multilingual voice applications. 

 CURSOR'S ANYSPHERE $9.9B VALUATION (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anysphere, maker of AI coding assistant Cursor, raised $900M at a
$9.9B valuation as ARR surged past $500M.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPENAI THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT: JUNE 2025 (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LLMs aren't giving bad actors fundamentally new capabilities. OpenAI
has published 10 examples of models accelerating existing hacking,
fraud, and misinformation operations. This includes North Korean
actors using GPT to scale fraudulent IT worker schemes, Russian groups
developing sophisticated malware, and Cambodian scammers generating
multilingual ‚Äútask scams‚Äù promising victims $500/day for liking
TikTok posts. 

 LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN SEARCH AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS (4 HOUR
VIDEO) [11] 

 This 4-hour session, presented during the AI Engineer World's Fair
2025, covers recent innovations in search and recommendation systems.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 APPLE RESEARCH FINDS CRITICAL LIMITATIONS IN REASONING MODELS (20
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 When OpenAI's o3, Claude, and DeepSeek-R1 were tested in puzzle
environments, their performance collapsed beyond certain complexity
thresholds, despite generating detailed "thinking" processes. The
models exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit where their reasoning
effort actually decreases as problems become more complex, and they
fail to improve even when given explicit solution algorithms. 

 LLM-DRIVEN DATA ANNOTATION (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 To address label uncertainty in LLM-based annotation, this paper
introduces a method that captures multiple possible labels and uses a
teacher-student framework called CanDist to distill them into a single
output. 

 CLAUDE COMPOSER CLI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Claude Composer CLI is a tool that enhances Claude Code with
automation, UX, and configuration. It reduces interruptions while
giving users flexible control and tools to configure Claude. The tool
provides users with system notifications to keep them informed. Users
can control which permission dialogs are automatically accepted.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PORTRAITS: PERSONALIZED AI COACHING BUILT ALONGSIDE REAL EXPERTS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Labs launched Portraits, an AI coaching tool featuring experts
like Kim Scott, to provide AI-driven guidance. The tool uses Gemini's
capabilities to simulate expert advice through interactive avatars. 

 INTRODUCING MODIFY VIDEO (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Modify Video allows professionals to reimagine environments,
lighting, and textures in videos without altering motion or
performance. It offers tools for restyling, retexturing, and editing
specific elements like wardrobe and props. Outperforming competitors,
Modify Video maintains motion consistency, offering multiple output
variants and using advanced performance signals for high-fidelity
creative control.
