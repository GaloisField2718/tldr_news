RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OPEN MUSE REPRODUCTION (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MUSE is a masked image generation model that uses Transformers.
HuggingFace and Stability AI have worked to reproduce it in the open
and have released training code, model checkpoints, and a paper. The
models were not trained for as long as some of the best image
diffusion models, but they show promise! 

 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed CAINet, a novel approach for improving
RGB-T semantic segmentation, crucial for autonomous driving. This
system uniquely combines different types of data, focusing on their
complementary aspects and global context. 

 3D-AWARE VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While Visual question answering (VQA) has seen advancements, most
models only tackle 2D reasoning, neglecting the complexity of 3D
visual scenes. This research presents 3D-aware VQA.

 RAGATOUILLE LIBRARY FOR RETRIEVAL PIPELINES (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a way to include external
knowledge into a language model‚Äôs generation. This library allows
for training and researching state-of-the-art RAG systems. 

 REAL-TIME VIDEO TRACKING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ODTrack, a new video tracking system, improves the way we track
objects in videos. Unlike older systems that struggled with connecting
past and future frames, ODTrack uses a method called 'online token
propagation' to better link consecutive video frames. 

 POISONING ATTACKS AGAINST RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This survey provides an in-depth look at the vulnerability of
recommender systems to 'poisoning attacks', where harmful data is
intentionally added to manipulate results.

 INTEL'S GAUDI 2 CHIP SURPASSES A100 (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The new chip from Intel, available on a number of platforms and
on-premise deployment, has excellent training throughput, flops, and
decoding bandwidth. 

 THE AI TRUST CRISIS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Dropbox's new AI features have raised privacy concerns among users
who fear their data might be used to train OpenAI's models, despite
Dropbox's denial and a policy that requires customer consent for such
use. This situation highlights a broader crisis of trust in AI and
data privacy, emphasizing the need for clear communication and
transparency from companies about their data usage practices. 

 THE OFFICIAL OPENAI PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE (26 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A comprehensive step-by-step guide that shares strategies and tactics
for getting better results from large language models like GPT-4.
