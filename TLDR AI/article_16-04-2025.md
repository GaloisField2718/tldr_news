 GET MORE FROM YOUR LLMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When LLMs fail, it's rarely about the model's raw power. Turing's
“Maximizing Your LLM ROI” whitepaper shows how the real culprits
— misaligned training, poor evaluation, and optimization gaps —
can quietly sabotage ROI.

Inside, you'll learn how to:

● Reduce hidden inefficiencies that drive up LLM costs

● Strengthen evaluation techniques for higher accuracy and
reliability

● Build an AI strategy that maximizes performance and business value

Get the white paper now to optimize your AI investments. [4]
