 MIT RESEARCH: AI COULD DRIVE FRAUD LOSSES TO $40 BILLION BY 2027
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Generative AI has turned financial fraud into an industrial
operation. Voice cloning now takes just an hour of YouTube footage and
an $11 subscription. Synthetic identity fraud already costs banks $6
billion annually. And fraudsters are scaling attacks using AI tools
that traditional defenses can't handle.

Plaid and MIT Technology Review's new research [4] reveals the true
scope of AI-powered fraud—and why current prevention methods are
like "bringing a stick to a gunfight."

The report looks at current fraud tactics—from credential-stuffing
automation to AI-generated deepfakes targeting elderly
victims—and how organizations are fighting back [4] with their own
AI systems.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI SUES APPLE AND OPENAI (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk's xAI filed a lawsuit accusing Apple and OpenAI of
colluding to suppress competition in AI, citing Apple's partnership to
embed ChatGPT in its ecosystem as anticompetitive behavior. 

 INTRODUCING COMET PLUS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Perplexity has launched a $5 standalone subscription that gives users
access to premium publisher content by sharing revenue with
participating publishers based on human visits and AI interactions.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY STACKING SLIDING WINDOWS CAN'T SEE VERY FAR (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern language models use a building block called sliding window
attention to handle long texts efficiently. The effective memory of
these models has fundamental limitations. They struggle to use
information from more than about 1,500 words ago, far less than the
theoretical 100,000. This is because information gets diluted as it
spreads through the network, and residual connections create an
exponential barrier that blocks distant information. 

 RAG IS DEAD, CONTEXT ENGINEERING IS KING (71 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In this interview, Jeff Huber from Chroma talks about what matters in
vector databases, why modern search for AI is different, and how to
ship systems that don't rot as context grows. Context engineering is
the job of figuring out what should be in the context window at any
given LLM generation step. It involves an inner loop, setting up the
context window 'this time', and an outer loop that involves getting
better at filling the context window with only relevant information.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 MEET TURING: THE TRUSTED, _INDEPENDENT_ RESEARCH ACCELERATOR OF
LEADING AI LABS (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Training frontier models? Turing [9] remains the independent choice
for the world's top AI teams — from multimodal training to RL gyms.
1000s of domain-trained experts across 60+ languages, 700+ benchmark
tasks built from real-world business and STEM use cases, 50+ frontier
projects supported successfully. Ask about free migration paths. [9] 

 THINKMESH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 ThinkMesh is a Python library for running diverse reasoning paths in
parallel, scoring them with internal confidence signals, reallocating
compute to promising branches, and fusing outcomes with verifiers and
reducers. It works with offline Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM/TGI,
and hosted APIs.ThinkMesh is confidence‑gated, strategy‑driven,
and offline‑friendly. It is still in an early development stage. 

 SUPERCLAUDE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This framework enhances Claude Code with 21 new slash commands, 14
specialized AI agents, and 6 MCP server integrations to create
structured workflows for development tasks. The project has gained 14k
GitHub stars in a month and claims to reduce context usage by 30-50%. 

 HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS IN ROBOTICS (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The IVA framework trains Vision-Language-Action models to detect and
respond to instructions based on false premises, using clarification
and alternative grounding strategies. 

 CONTINUAL LEARNING FOR LLM AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Memento is a memory-based framework that enables LLM agents to learn
continually without altering model weights. It uses a
planner–executor loop with case-based reasoning and supports a wide
range of tools. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 PERPLEXITY IS LAUNCHING A NEW REVENUE-SHARE MODEL FOR PUBLISHERS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Perplexity will start paying publishers for news articles from a
$42.5 million revenue pool. The money will be distributed when
Perplexity's AI assistant or search engine uses a news article to
fulfill a task or answer a search request. The payments come out of
the subscription revenue generated by Perplexity's new news service,
Comet Plus, which will roll out widely in the fall. Publishers will
get 80% of Comet Plus revenue. 

 GPT-5-PRO CAN PROVE NEW INTERESTING MATHEMATICS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sebastien Bubeck, an employee at OpenAI, claims that gpt-5-pro can
prove new interesting mathematics. Bubeck took the first version of a
paper on convex optimization with a clean open problem in it and asked
gpt-5-pro to work on it. The model proved a better bound than what was
in the paper. The proof is correct - the second version of the paper
(already published) had already reached this conclusion.
