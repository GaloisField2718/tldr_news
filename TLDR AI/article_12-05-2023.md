HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

ANTHROPIC SCALES TO 100K CONTEXT TOKENS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anthropic.com/index/100k-context-windows?utm_source=tldrai]


Following the trend, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude model can now operate over a
dramatically longer context. This means your org can put full
documents into the model and the language model will operate on them.
They give an example of feeding 240 pages of coding docs into Claude
and having it answer coding questions. The technical details of this
change are not shared. 

STABILITY AI TEXT TO ANIMATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://stability.ai/blog/stable-animation-sdk?utm_source=tldrai] 

SDK released to allow users to create animations using stable
diffusion models. You can generate these animations unconditionally,
conditioned in an image, or conditioned on a video. The results are
lovely, are somewhat computationally expensive, and have a very
distinctive style. 

BARD UPDATES (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-bard-updates-io-2023/?utm_source=tldrai]


Google's Bard, a collaborative tool powered by generative AI, is set
to become even more versatile. Since its launch, Bard has been
enhanced with the PaLM 2 large language model, improving its math and
coding skills. Now, Google is making Bard available in over 180
countries and in Japanese and Korean, with 40 languages expected soon.
The platform will soon support more visual responses, including image
prompts, and incorporate Google Lens capabilities. Developers can also
look forward to precise source citations, a dark theme, an "export"
button, and more integration with Google's apps and services, as well
as third-party platforms like Adobe Firefly.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

CREATING BETTER VIDEO CONTENT USING AI AND SKETCHES (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05845?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper describes a new way to make video content using artificial
intelligence (AI), based on sketches and text. The method, which
combines two technologies called Text-to-Video Zero and ControlNet,
can create high-quality, consistent videos that closely match what the
user intended, as demonstrated by various experiments. 

DIFFUSION-BASED 3D FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION FROM A SINGLE IMAGE (12
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06077?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces a method that uses diffusion models, which have
been successful in creating images, to reconstruct 3D facial features
from just one image. The process involves using a dataset of facial
textures, simulating various lighting conditions, and then using the
diffusion model to fill in missing parts of the texture and unknown
reflective properties, resulting in a more accurate and consistent 3D
face. 

AN IN-DEPTH LOOK AT TEXT-TO-3D: THE NEW FRONTIER IN GENERATIVE AI (28
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06131?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper is a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of
text-to-3D, a part of generative AI that turns written descriptions
into 3D models. It introduces different types of 3D data, foundational
technologies, and how they're combined in recent works, as well as how
text-to-3D is used in various applications like creating avatars and
generating scenes.

VIDEOCHAT: A NEW SYSTEM FOR UNDERSTANDING VIDEOS BETTER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Ask-Anything?utm_source=tldrai] 

This repo introduces VideoChat, a system that makes sense of videos by
combining artificial intelligence techniques for understanding videos
and language. The researchers also created a large set of videos with
detailed descriptions and conversations to help train the system to be
better at understanding the sequence of events and cause-effect
relationships in videos. 

EVA (GITHUB REPO)

EU CONSIDERING TOUGHER AI RULES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/g3alH?utm_source=tldrai] 

European lawmakers came a step closer to passing new rules regulating
artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, following a crunch vote
on Thursday. The European Union's highly anticipated AI Act is set to
be the first comprehensive legislation governing the technology, with
new rules around the use of facial recognition, biometric
surveillance, and other AI applications.

AI-POWERED VC FIRM VELA EMERGES FROM STEALTH WITH $25M UNDER
MANAGEMENT (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/11/ai-powered-vc-firm-vela-emerges-from-stealth-with-25m-under-management?utm_source=tldrai]


Former Google senior program manager, Yiƒüit Ihlamur, founded Vela
Partners, an AI-powered, product-led VC firm aiming to accelerate
innovation. Vela's approach blends AI and expert heuristics to
identify trends, source opportunities, and detect threats to its
investments. Despite issues of bias in AI, which have been flagged as
potential problems in the VC space, Ihlamur maintains that
understanding underlying behaviors in the venture market is key. The
firm differentiates itself with a "game-like" terminal to aid
entrepreneurs and partners, and a public GitHub repo housing its
algorithmic models.
