HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AI21 RELEASES JAMBA LANGUAGE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mamba is a style of model that is supposed to beat Transformers in
efficiency while matching performance. Jamba is a novel variant that
includes MoE layers. It can run at 1.6k tokens per second with a
context length of 128k tokens. It achieves 67% on the MMLU benchmark.
The weights are available. 

 HUME INTRODUCES EMPATHIC VOICE INTERFACE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hume has released the Empathic Voice Interface (EVI), the first
conversational AI with emotional intelligence. 

 GOOGLE STARTS TESTING AI OVERVIEWS FROM SGE IN MAIN GOOGLE SEARCH
INTERFACE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is piloting AI-generated overviews in search results for
complex queries with a subset of U.S. users without requiring opt-in
to its Search Generative Experience. This feedback-driven test aims to
enhance user experience and may impact site traffic dynamics due to
changes in ad placements and organic search visibility.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 1 BIT, POST TRAINING, QUANTIZATION (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 1 Bit language models are exciting. This work shows how to quantize
the Linear layers of a language model without sacrificing performance.
This can result in a 70B model running on consumer GPUs. 

 LONG FORM FACTUALITY IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You can use language models to generate factual information. Google
has released a dataset and benchmarks to show how well each model
performs. This report gives insight into how to improve a model‚Äôs
factuality and shows language models winning against human annotators
in a majority of cases. 

 IMPROVING MODEL ADAPTATION (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CoDA is a new approach to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). It
helps AI models better adapt to unlabeled, challenging environments by
learning from differences at both the scene and image levels.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BUILD A GENAI CHATBOT USING REAL-TIME DATA WITH AMAZON BEDROCK AND
CONFLUENT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Watch this quick demo to see how you can build a virtual banking
chatbot [11] that answers based on real-time data. The demo uses
Amazon Bedrock to power the chatbot with a GenAI model of your choice
(demo will use Claude 2 by Anthropic) and Confluent Cloud [12] to make
real-time data available for retrieval. Watch the demo [11] 

 USING AI TO IDENTIFY SOURCES OF CONFUSION IN YOUR CONTENT (GITHUB
REPO) [13] 

 This approach pinpoints the exact content that triggers user
questions online, from lectures to news articles. This method, known
as backtracing, aims to help content creators refine their work by
identifying and understanding the causes of confusion, curiosity, or
emotional reactions. 

 HIGH-RESOLUTION LARGE LANGUAGE-VISION ASSISTANT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Researchers have developed a new method, Mixture-of-Resolution
Adaptation (MRA), which improves AI's ability to recognize details in
images. 

 3D MEDICAL IMAGING DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 CT-RATE is a dataset that marries 3D medical imaging with textual
reports. CT-CLIP is a versatile AI framework optimized for these
images.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND AI ESCAPE VELOCITY (20 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI Futurist Ray Kurzweil invented the law of accelerating returns,
which states that the rate of progress is increasing at an exponential
rate over time. In a recent discussion, Kurzweil explored various
topics including prospects that are only getting better, the direction
in which the AI economy is headed, human relationships with AIs,
longevity escape velocity, and much more. 

 PLENTIFUL, HIGH-PAYING JOBS IN THE AGE OF AI (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI experts are exploring automating human tasks, leading to concerns
about job loss and wage declines. However, the view that AI
advancement will inevitably result in human job obsolescence may not
be correct. Humans may retain employment in an AI-dominated future due
to constraints like computing power and opportunity costs, although
this scenario is not guaranteed.
