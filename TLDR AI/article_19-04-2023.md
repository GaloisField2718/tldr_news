NEW ADOBE LIGHTROOM AI INNOVATIONS EMPOWER EVERYONE TO EDIT LIKE A PRO
(4 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/04/18/new-adobe-lightroom-ai-innovations-empower-everyone-edit-like-pro?utm_source=tldrai]


Adobe has introduced new AI-powered features for its Lightroom
ecosystem, including Denoise and Curves in masking, enabling users to
make highly customized and precise edits to their photos.
Additionally, adaptive presets and expanded masking categories for
Select People are available, along with Black & white for video and AI
masking and adaptive presets on the web, making it easier for everyone
to edit photos like a pro and bring their creative visions to life. 

ARTIST REJECTS PHOTO PRIZE AFTER AI-GENERATED IMAGE WINS AWARD (5
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ai-photo-win-sony-scli-intl/index.html?utm_source=tldrai]


German artist Boris Eldagsen rejected an award from the Sony World
Photography Award after revealing that his submission, "Pseudomnesia:
The Electrician," was generated by AI. Eldagsen hoped that his actions
would prompt a conversation around AI-generated images and encourage
separate competitions for such works. The World Photography
Organisation, which runs the competition, stated that they recognized
the importance of AI and its impact on image-making but emphasized
that the awards would continue to focus on championing the excellence
and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium. 

VIRAL AI-POWERED DRAKE AND THE WEEKND SONG IS REMOVED FROM STREAMING
SERVICES (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral-ai-powered-drake-weeknd-song-removed-streaming-services-rcna80098?utm_source=tldrai]


An AI-voiced rap song imitating the voices of Drake and The Weeknd was
removed from streaming services due to a copyright claim by Universal
Music Group (UMG). The anonymous musician, ghostwriter, used AI to
create the vocals for the song "heart on my sleeve." UMG recently
urged streaming platforms to ban AI programs from using copyrighted
music for training purposes. Media lawyer Edward Klaris explained that
the song potentially infringes on the artists' right of publicity, but
the legality of using copyrighted songs to train AI models remains
uncertain.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LEARNING TO COMPRESS PROMPTS WITH GIST TOKENS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08467?utm_source=tldrai] 

A new technique called "gisting" has been introduced as a way to
utilize multitask capabilities of language models without requiring
prompts or model retraining for each task. Gisting compresses prompts
into smaller sets of tokens that can be reused, resulting in
computational efficiency, FLOP reductions, and speedups without
significant loss in output quality. This technique was tested on two
LMs, achieving up to 26x compression of prompts and up to 40% FLOPs
reductions. 

DETRS BEAT YOLOS ON REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08069?utm_source=tldrai] 

A new real-time end-to-end object detector called Real-Time Detection
Transformer (RT-DETR) has been proposed to address the high
computational cost issue of end-to-end transformer-based detectors
(DETRs), which limits their practical application. RT-DETR uses an
efficient hybrid encoder, IoU-aware query selection, and supports
flexible adjustment of inference speed without retraining. RT-DETR
achieves up to 54.8% AP on COCO val2017 and 74 FPS on T4 GPU,
outperforming YOLO detectors and DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 in both
speed and accuracy.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

STREET FIGHTER AI (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/linyiLYi/street-fighter-ai?utm_source=tldrai] 

There has been recent work in making RL agents less afraid. One paper
specifically talks about mitigating cowardice in models trained in RL.
This is interesting in the realm of self-driving cars and terrifying
in other potential applications. This repository shows how we can now
train RL agents to win in a fighting game. The full training and
evaluation code is available. 

AUTO EVALUATOR (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/PineappleExpress808/auto-evaluator?utm_source=tldrai]


There is a task in ML called ‚ÄúQuestion Answering‚Äù which tries to
automate the processes of responding to questions with proper answers.
There are certain things that make this challenging such as
determining factuality or handling rephrasings. This tool uses a
language model to automate the generation and answering of questions.
This follows the trend in language models today where it is easier for
them to verify that something is correct rather than generate the
correct thing. 

WINDOW.AI (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/alexanderatallah/window.ai?utm_source=tldrai] 

Window AI is a browser extension that lets you configure AI models in
one place and use them on the web. 

CAMEL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/lightaime/camel?utm_source=tldrai] 

Camel explores the potential of building scalable techniques to
facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents and
provide insight into their "cognitive" processes. 

OCTOML: ON-DEMAND COMPUTE TO RUN GENERATIVE AI MODELS IN PRODUCTION
(SPONSOR)
[https://octoml.ai/cp/model-serving-compute-access/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter]


OctoML is building a compute layer that's as easy as OpenAI but
flexible to run on any cloud
[https://octoml.ai/cp/model-serving-compute-access/?utm_source=tldr&utm_medium=newsletter].
The goal is to make developing apps with the latest generative AI
models simple: pick your model, spin up a model serving API, and run
an inference endpoint on the most cost-efficient compute. Learn more
and request early access

HOW TO USE CHATGPT IN YOUR PM WORK (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-use-chatgpt-in-your-pm-work?utm_source=tldrai]


Product managers are increasingly incorporating AI tools like ChatGPT
into their work. In the future, learning to work alongside AI will
become essential for knowledge work, as evidenced by tools like
Grammarly for writing and Copilot for engineers. ChatGPT can be
integrated into various aspects of product management, including
summarizing user feedback and data, suggesting product names, and
strengthening arguments by identifying critical questions, gaps, and
hidden assumptions. As AI continues to develop, working with these
tools will become increasingly important for professionals in the
field.
