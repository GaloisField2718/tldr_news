 HOW COMPANIES ARE USING CUSTOM AI AGENTS TO BOOST PRODUCTIVITY 10X
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 You might have heard the chatter about AI agents. But what's behind
this recent trend, and who's already on board?

You.com's free whitepaper [4] reveals exactly how marketing, sales,
and analytics departments are using AI agents to save time, improve
output quality, and optimize workflows. The paper details:

✅ Three simple steps to create custom AI agents [4] for your
domain-specific workflows.

✅ Dozens of use-cases across three sectors.

✅ Industry breakdowns of where AI agents are being deployed – and
how often.

 OPENAI FACES AI IMPROVEMENT SLOWDOWN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's next major model, code-named "Orion," reportedly shows less
improvement over previous models, suggesting a slowdown in AI
advancement. To tackle this, OpenAI has formed a foundations team
focused on enhancing models with alternative methods, such as
synthetic data training and post-training adjustments, as the
availability of new data has decreased. 

 WORLD'S LARGEST OPEN-SOURCE MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Near Protocol has announced plans to create a massive 1.4 trillion
parameter open-source AI model. It aims to surpass existing models
like Meta's Llama.

 LLAMAPREVIEW (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LlamaPReview is an AI assistant for GitHub that offers one-click
installation and auto-reviews of pull requests with context-aware
analysis. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates
with GitHub Actions, providing insightful feedback directly on PRs.
Currently available for free, it enhances code quality by identifying
issues and suggesting optimizations. 

 SMOLLM2 (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Hugging Face's SmolLM2 is a compact language model family with sizes
ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters trained on 11 trillion tokens.
These models efficiently run on-device and support various tasks, with
weights available under the Apache 2 license. Quantized models like
the 1.7GB and 138MB versions provide diverse flexibility for different
computational needs. 

 EMBEDDINGS ARE UNDERRATED (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Machine learning embeddings can transform technical writing by
enabling mathematical comparisons of arbitrary text, improving
features like recommendation systems with semantic similarities. They
place text within a multi-dimensional space, providing intuitive
semantic relationships, useful for tasks like identifying related
content. Docs site owners who offer embeddings for their content could
foster innovative applications from their communities.
