 BUILD THE FUTURE OF AGENTIC COMMERCE WITH THE PAYPAL MCP SERVER
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The PayPal MCP server delivers speed and reliability using prebuilt
functions that connect directly to PayPal's APIs, reducing development
time and errors during commerce operations. Its architecture is
scalable and flexible, allowing you to connect with a range of
platforms.

Check out this video [4] featuring PayPal engineers Brenden Lane and
Vikram Bhoomidi as they explore the Model Context Protocol, its
benefits, and how it allows interactions with payment systems using
natural language commands.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK 4 BENCHMARKS LEAK WITH 45% SCORE ON HUMANITY LAST EXAM (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Leaked benchmarks show that Grok 4 will be state-of-the-art.
References to the model have surfaced in the xAI console. If the
benchmarks are real, Grok 4 could outperform leaders like Gemini 2.5
Pro, o3 Pro, and Claude 4 Opus. xAI faces competitive pressure to
release Grok 4 before the market shifts again - OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic are rumored to be preparing fresh releases for launch. 

 CHARACTER AI'S REAL-TIME VIDEO GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Character.AI's TalkingMachines is a real-time, audio-driven video
generation model that creates FaceTime-style animations from a single
image and voice input.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ADDING MEMORY TO GEMINI 2.5 CHATBOTS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A guide explaining how to use the Gemini API and the open-source mem0
tool to give Gemini 2.5 chatbots long-term memory. The setup allows
bots to recall past interactions, personalize responses, and reduce
repetition for more context-aware conversations. 

 THE AMERICAN DEEPSEEK PROJECT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta's recent AI shortcomings have created a vacuum in the
open-source AI ecosystem that has largely been filled by Chinese
models. If current dynamics continue, the AI world will be split
between powerful but expensive, closed-source American models and
low-cost, ubiquitous but potentially compromised Chinese models. The
US likely has a very small window, roughly the next two years, to
counter this trend by investing $100-500 million into an open-source
model that is as good as the best closed-source model. 

 BABA IS EVAL (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 'Baba is You' is a puzzle game where the rules have to be manipulated
to win. The level of abstraction required to solve most levels makes
it a formidable reasoning benchmark. This study looks at how large
language models fare in playing the game. At the moment, Claude 4 is
pretty bad at playing the game - a reasoning model may be better
equipped to play, so the next step in the study may be to test those
models.

 LOCAL-FIRST GENAI WITH NVIDIA AI WORKBENCH ON DELL PRO MAX (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 You don't need a PhD in data science to create AI workflows. With
NVIDIA AI Workbench on Dell Pro Max with NVIDIA RTX PRO GPUs [12],
expert and novice developers can easily create, test, and customize
GenAI projects locally — then scale up from the deskside to the
datacenter. Get the datasheet [12] 

 WHAT CAN AGENTS ACTUALLY DO? (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 There's a lot of excitement about what AI can do, but many of the
conversations about the technology are so abstract that they border on
meaningless. This post attempts to concisely summarize how AI agents
work. It looks at a handful of real-world use cases for the
technology. AI agents are a multiplier on software quality and system
design. If software or systems are poorly designed, agents will only
cause harm. 

 SAKANA AI'S TREEQUEST: DEPLOY MULTI-MODEL TEAMS THAT OUTPERFORM
INDIVIDUAL LLMS BY 30% (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sakana AI's TreeQuest uses Multi-LLM AB-MCTS to combine multiple
LLMs. Achieving a 30% performance boost over individual models, this
technique leverages the unique strengths of different models through
Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search, dynamically assigning the
optimal model for each task. Available as an open-source tool,
TreeQuest allows businesses to apply this approach to complex
problems, enhancing AI capabilities and reducing hallucination risks. 

 AGENT-SQUAD (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A framework for building collaborative multi-agent AI systems that
can plan, delegate, and work together to solve complex tasks.

 WHY I DON'T THINK AGI IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER (15 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 It's hard to get normal humanlike labor out of LLMs because they lack
some fundamental capabilities. They don't get better over time, and
this lack of continual learning is a huge problem. There's no way to
give models human-level feedback, so users are stuck with the
abilities they have out of the box. Messing around with system prompts
doesn't produce anything close to the kind of learning and improvement
that human employees experience. Humans are able to build up context,
interrogate their own failures, and pick up small improvements and
efficiencies as they practice a task. 

 GOOGLE FACES EU COMPLAINT OVER AI OVERVIEWS (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Independent Publishers Alliance filed an antitrust complaint with
the European Commission, alleging that Google's AI Overviews misuse
web content and have led to traffic and revenue loss for publishers.
