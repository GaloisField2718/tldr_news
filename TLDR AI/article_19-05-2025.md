 NEW RESEARCH BY GOOGLE: GEN AI HITS 98% ENTERPRISE ADOPTION, BUT DATA
QUALITY AND SECURITY CONCERNS LINGER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Google Cloud's survey of 500+ global technology leaders [4] validates
what everyone is feeling: generative AI is now mainstream (sorry AI
hipsters), and it's present at the vast majority of larger
organizations.

However, not all is smooth sailing, and many are still figuring out
the best way to build an AI-ready cloud that's robust, secure, and
cost-effective.

The 2025 State of AI Infrastructure report [4] offers a glimpse into
how enterprises are preparing for the next tidal wave of AI adoption.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TRUMP OPENS AI CHIP FLOODGATES TO MIDDLE EAST AFTER REVERSING
BIDEN-ERA RESTRICTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 President Trump's Middle East trip has yielded massive AI deals,
including Nvidia shipping 18,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and
plans for the largest non-US AI data center in Abu Dhabi. Critics warn
these partnerships could enable China to access restricted US AI
technology through its extensive economic ties with Gulf states
prompting new bipartisan legislation to prevent such transfers. 

 INTRODUCING CODEX (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI just launched Codex, an autonomous coding agent that writes
features, fixes bugs, and submits pull requests in isolated cloud
environments. Companies like Cisco and Temporal are already using it
to handle entire codebases while their engineers focus on higher-level
work. The agent can tackle multiple tasks simultaneously, run tests,
and provide detailed citations of every change it makes. 

 ANTHROPIC RECEIVES $2.5 BILLION, FIVE-YEAR CREDIT LINE FROM WALL
STREET (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic has secured a new line of credit to further accelerate its
growth, adding to the $18.2 billion already raised from investors. The
company reported that its annualized revenue doubled to $2 billion in
the last 6 months. The move mirrors OpenAI's strategy, which
established a $4 billion revolving credit line last October.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE MORE PERSUASIVE THAN INCENTIVIZED HUMAN
PERSUADERS (35 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Claude 3.5 Sonnet significantly outperformed human persuaders in a
controlled experiment where both attempted to influence participants'
answers on quiz questions. Claude achieved 7.6% higher success rates
when trying to convince participants to select specific answers and
was more effective both at promoting correct answers (+12.2%) and
incorrect answers (-15.1%). 

 HOW HARDWARE LIMITATIONS HAVE, AND WILL, PREVENT RAPID AI TAKEOFFS (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Major algorithmic breakthroughs for LLMs, like the transformer
architecture, multi-query attention, and mixture-of-experts systems,
only demonstrate substantial benefits (10-50x performance gains) when
implemented with massive amounts of compute. This challenges
predictions of rapid AI self-improvement since hardware constraints
like chip export controls, power consumption limits, and cooling
infrastructure bottlenecks would significantly limit any "intelligence
explosion" scenario. 

 SUPERHUMAN CODERS IN AI 2027 (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Superhuman coding by AI will likely occur by 2033, later than AI
Futures' estimates of 2028-2030. This delay is due to factors like
handling engineering complexity, working without feedback loops, and
achieving cost and speed. Unforeseen challenges, such as geopolitical
issues or changes in lab priorities, could further push out timelines.

 OPENAI ANNOUNCES $250K PRIZE FOR USING THEIR MODELS TO FIND LOST
AMAZONIAN CITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The challenge invites competitors to use o3, o4-mini, and GPT-4.1
models with open-source data to pinpoint undiscovered archaeological
sites in the Amazon by June 29. Winners will receive funding to verify
their findings in the field alongside archaeologists. 

 GENERATIVE AI ADOPTION INDEX (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Organizations are prioritizing generative AI over security spending
for 2025. Companies are creating leadership roles like Chief AI
Officer and adopting aggressive hiring and internal development
strategies for AI talent. Many are using a hybrid model, combining
off-the-shelf AI models with custom applications using proprietary
data. 

 THERE SHOULD BE NO AI BUTTON (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The "AI button" UX pattern is limiting and creates unnecessary
distinctions between AI-assisted and manual workflows. Better
alternatives, like integrating AI as a "shadow teammate" within
workflows, enhance collaboration without fragmenting user experience.
