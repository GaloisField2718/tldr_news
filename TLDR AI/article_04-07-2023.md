RESEARCH & INNOVATION

CLASSIFIER-FREE GUIDANCE FOR LANGUAGE MODELS (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/papers/2306.17806?utm_source=tldrai]

If you're looking for interesting trends in AI today, the idea of
decoding tokens in new ways is an avenue of active research.
Currently, each model gives the same amount of compute to each token,
and the sampling method is somewhat simple. If we can improve sampling
and guidance, we may be able to dramatically improve performance
without retraining. This paper suggests that we can double our
effective model size just by using classifier free guidance, which was
first explored in the context of text to image diffusion models. 

A NEW FRAMEWORK TO DETECT ANY DEEPFAKES (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17075v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This research presents a new system called Detect Any Deepfakes (DADF)
for improved detection and precise location identification of
manipulated facial images (deepfakes). Using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and incorporating a multiscale adapter and Reconstruction
Guided Attention (RGA), DADF improves deepfake detection performance. 

HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION WITH LATENT DIFFUSION MODELS FROM
HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://sites.google.com/view/stablediffusion-with-brain/?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have proposed a new method using a diffusion model,
specifically a latent diffusion model (LDM) named Stable Diffusion,
for reconstructing high-resolution, high-fidelity images from human
brain activity captured via fMRI. The method, which reduces
computational cost while maintaining generative performance, does not
require extra training or fine-tuning of complex deep learning models.
The study also gives a neuroscientific interpretation of different LDM
components, presenting a promising new approach to understand how our
brain represents visual experiences.

CREATING 3D SHAPES FROM 2D IMAGES AND TEXTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://neuralcarver.github.io/michelangelo/?utm_source=tldrai]

This project introduces a method to generate 3D shapes from 2D images
or texts, reducing inconsistencies that result from the dimensional
differences. The method uses a two-model framework, the
Shape-Image-Text-Aligned Variational Auto-Encoder (SITA-VAE) and
Aligned Shape Latent Diffusion Model (ASLDM), to map the 3D shapes
into a space that aligns with images and texts. 

A NEW METHOD FOR MORE REALISTIC 3D MOVEMENT ANALYSIS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/xymsh/grammar?utm_source=tldrai]

The research introduces a new method that improves the understanding
of 3D movement in relation to the environment, offering more realistic
poses in contrast to existing techniques that produce implausible
results. 

SEAMLESS VIDEO GENERATION WITH TEXT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://anonymous-31415926.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

This paper presents a new method for generating consistent,
high-quality videos from text. It involves creating key frames using
an adapted image model, and then spreading these styles across the
video with special matching and blending techniques, resulting in
videos that look great and flow smoothly.

PODCAST WITH THE AUTHOR OF MEGABYTE (90 MIN LISTEN)
[https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/e40-metas-megabyte-revolution-with-lili-yu-of-meta-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]

Tokenization and decoding are two weak points of current language
models. Tokenization specifically is a challenge because it hinders
our ability to move to truly multimodal solutions. The recent work
from Meta around working on a million bytes shows a way forward
because it eliminates the need for tokenization and allows a single
model to operate on any sort of input data. 

AI AND THE AUTOMATION OF WORK (12 MINUTE READ)
