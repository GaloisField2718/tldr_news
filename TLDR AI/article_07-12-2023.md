HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE GEMINI (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's flagship model Gemini is natively multimodal with text
capabilities matching GPT4 while also being able to operate on many
other data sequences. It also trained Alpha Code 2, which is an 85th
percentile coder on code forces. Alpha Code 2 will be available in
Google‚Äôs API after December 13th. 

 META‚ÄôS AI IMAGE GENERATOR IS AVAILABLE AS A STANDALONE WEBSITE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has launched 'Imagine,' a standalone image generator with its
own website featuring generative AI that creates images from text
prompts. 

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS COPILOT IS GETTING OPENAI‚ÄôS LATEST MODELS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Microsoft is enhancing its Copilot service with new features,
including OpenAI's latest GPT-4 Turbo model, an upgraded DALL-E 3
model, a new code interpreter feature, and a 'Deep Search' function in
Bing.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DESCRIBE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SETS OF IMAGES (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper uses natural language to describe what is different
between two collections of images. This is a novel problem and a
challenging one. The solution involves captioning and reranking the
individual images and summarizing them with a language model. 

 3D OBJECT DETECTION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed Diffusion-SS3D, a new method to improve
semi-supervised 3D object detection using diffusion models. This
approach involves adding noise to object size and class label
distributions in 3D space and then using the diffusion model to
denoise and generate better bounding box outputs. 

 A BENCHMARK TO TEST LARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This project introduces BenchLMM, a benchmark designed to test the
robustness of Large Multimodal Models like GPT-4V and LLaVA against
various image styles.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 APPLE‚ÄôS NEW ARRAY FRAMEWORK FOR MACS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Apple quietly released a cool Array framework that is accelerated on
Mac devices because of unified memory. It is simple and clean and
provides some GPU support as well. 

 LIGHTNING FAST DIFFUSERS INFERENCE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Stable Fast is an inference engine for HuggingFace diffusion models. 

 INTRODUCING THE OPENAI SWITCH KIT (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Switch your project to open source in just a few lines of code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPLORING LEAP-OF-THOUGHT ABILITIES IN LLMS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This study introduces the use of the Oogiri humor generation game to
explore the Leap-of-Thought capabilities in multimodal LLMs. This
approach challenges LLMs to exhibit non-sequential thinking, a skill
crucial for generating creative and humorous responses to various
types of multimodal information. 

 OPTIMIZING LLMS FOR REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Lightspeed shares insights from Google and TitanML about the ins and
outs of optimizing LLMs whether via prompting or fine-tuning. 

 SLOW-BURN AI: WHEN AUGMENTATION, NOT AUTOMATION, IS THE REAL THREAT
(8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While automation will likely be the way of the future, today, it‚Äôs
all about augmenting your existing processes/self without having to
rip and replace everything. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of just
augmenting yourself to do your job better - thinking through what and
how to automate things and viewing your role holistically will allow
you to find the best use of AI for your needs.

 USING META‚ÄôS NEW EFFICIENTSAM (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK) [17] 

 Segment Anything is a great model, but it is slow to run. Efficient
Segment Anything is a new model that uses a number of optimizations to
run significantly faster. 

 ELON TOLD OPENAI TO MOVE FASTER RIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT THE COMPANY (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Right before leaving the company, Elon Musk implored OpenAI to move
faster, a departure from his typically more skeptical comments toward
AI. 

 COPILOTKIT (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Build in-app AI chatbots and AI-powered Textareas into React web
apps.
