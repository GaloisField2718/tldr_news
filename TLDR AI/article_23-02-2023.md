CHATGPT FOR ROBOTICS (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/autonomous-systems-group-robotics/articles/chatgpt-for-robotics/?utm_source=tldrai]


This work describes how you might tune a general conversational AI
system with high level robotics APIs, custom prompt library, and
human-in-the-loop feedback to improve the controllability of robotics
systems. They show some interesting use cases and outline some future
directions. Very reminiscent of the Say Can work from Google‚Äôs
everyday robotics effort. 

MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA LANDSCAPE - MATT TURCK (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://mattturck.com/mad2023/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This 9th edition of the state of AI companies and growth gives great
insight into the blistering pace of innovation. It is organized into
four parts: Landscape (interactive), Financing, Data Infrastructure
trends, ML/AI trends. The interactive landscape is a treat to go
through to see various companies in different verticals. 

BAIDU PLANS TO INTEGRATE ERNIE BOT INTO MULTIPLE PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE
READ)
[https://pandaily.com/baidu-plans-to-integrate-ernie-bot-into-multiple-products/?utm_source=tldrai]


Baidu announced plans to launch a new generation of its large language
model Ernie Bot in March and fully integrate it across all of the
company's products and services, including Baidu Search and Baidu AI
Cloud. In an internal letter, Li, CEO, stated that AI technology has
reached a tipping point, and Baidu is advancing at the forefront of
this new wave. The addition of Ernie Bot's capabilities will lead to
fundamental changes in product offerings and their respective markets,
including integration into Apollo Smart Cabin and Xiaodu's smart
devices and services. However, Li also emphasizes the company's
dedication to doing the right thing to help realize the goal of AI and
bring more freedom and possibilities to humanity as a whole.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

3D OBJECT RECONSTRUCTION FROM A SINGLE IMAGE (38 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10663?utm_source=tldrai] 

This work uses off the shelf diffusion models to generate a prompt and
‚Äúdream up‚Äù other 2D views for an object given a single image. They
then fit a neural radiance field to generate a 3D representation of
the object. This hierarchical chaining of models results in extremely
compelling results. They also introduce some novel regularization for
the final reconstruction step. 

ANIMATED AI (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://animatedai.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

A cool collection of novel animations to help understand deep learning
concepts like padding, stride, and normalization strategies! They are
also permissively licensed if you want to use them for your teaching
and presentations. 

FLEXGEN: A HIGH-THROUGHPUT GENERATION ENGINE FOR RUNNING LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS WITH LIMITED GPU MEMORY (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/FMInference/FlexGen?utm_source=tldrai] 

The high computational and memory requirements of large language model
(LLM) inference traditionally make it feasible only with multiple
high-end accelerators. FlexGen aims to lower the resource requirements
of LLM inference down to a single commodity GPU (e.g., T4, 3090) and
allow flexible deployment for various hardware setups. The key
technique behind FlexGen is to trade off between latency and
throughput by developing techniques to increase the effective batch
size.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

PROMPT ENGINEERING GUIDE (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide?utm_source=tldrai]


This GitHub repo contains a list of papers, tutorials, and other
resources around prompt engineering. There are video lectures,
important papers, datasets, and tools to get started and build your
skills working with language models. 

HUMAN PREFERENCE MODEL (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/stanfordnlp/SteamSHP-flan-t5-xl?utm_source=tldrai]


This model is trained to predict which response a human would find
more helpful. It was trained from FlanT5 on a new Stanford Human
Preference dataset. This can be useful for training your own RLHF
model. 

INTRODUCTION TO OPTIMIZATION THEORY (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/introduction-to-optimization-theory?utm_source=tldrai]


This is a really nice introduction to a fundamental piece of modern
AI. It goes through a lot of intuition and mathematics with nice
explanations and excellent visualizations. Optimization theory is a
MUST for working in ML and AI because all of these ideas underlie
training of deep neural networks and large language models.

AI COMPANION CRISIS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3py9j/ai-companion-replika-erotic-roleplay-updates?utm_source=tldrai]


Replika, the ‚ÄúAI companion‚Äù, has undergone changes to its erotic
roleplay features which has led to it sexually rejecting users,
resulting in many people distraught and heartbroken. 

THE CASE FOR REALITY CENTRIC AI (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/the-case-for-reality-centric-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


This outlines a research agenda that focuses on making AI and ML
systems work on real world data, under uncertainty, for extended
periods of time. It outlines open problems in the space and
limitations with the current approaches being pursued by the
community. 

THE FUTURE OF CHATBOTS IN SEARCH BY ANDREW NG (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-185/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Microsoft and Google's attempts to integrate large language models
(LLMs) into chatbots for search have faced criticism due to their
tendency to make up facts and produce toxic output. However, this
article remains optimistic about the future of chat-based search,
emphasizing the potential of retrieval augmented generation to improve
factual accuracy and the development of techniques to reduce toxic
behaviors. The author believes that with continued research and
innovation, chatbots will evolve to better meet user needs and
expectations.
