HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC IS ABOUT TO DROP SONNET 5 DURING SUPER BOWL WEEK (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Anthropic plans to release Claude Sonnet 5, with early testing
showing strong math and coding capabilities, potentially outperforming
Claude Opus 4.5. The model, observed with a 128K context window, aims
to be a cost-effective solution for developers. Its release may
coincide with Super Bowl LX week, aligning with AI labs' marketing
strategies against ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. 

 OPENAI LAUNCHED CODEX FOR MACOS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI released a new macOS app for Codex designed to coordinate
multiple agents, run tasks in parallel, and manage long-running
software projects. It's now available to ChatGPT Free and Go users for
a limited time, with doubled rate limits for paid tiers. 

 XAI JOINS SPACEX (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SpaceX announced that xAI is joining its organization, integrating
efforts between Elon Musk's AI lab and the space company. The
collaboration aims to combine advanced AI research with aerospace
engineering, potentially accelerating autonomous systems and robotics
in space missions. This merger signals a strategic alignment of AI
development with real‑world hardware and exploration initiatives.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 TEACHING LLMS TO BE FUNNY (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tinker recently made it possible to post-train Kimi K2, Moonshot's 1
trillion parameter model. This post takes a look at how to train the
model on a qualitative reward. It shows readers how to train a model
to decompose jokes into verifiable properties. The resulting model can
make jokes and explain why jokes are funny. The models, code, and data
needed to replicate the model in the post are available. 

 CLAWDBOT'S MISSING LAYERS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 E-commerce took a while to take off because the infrastructure to
make it safe took time to develop. This is the same with agents. While
the technology has great potential, it is currently full of risks.
Agents need a security stack, just like e-commerce, where each layer
handles what the others can't. This post discusses the different
security layers AI agents need. Each layer represents an opportunity
for companies to build infrastructure that will make the entire
ecosystem possible. 

 FINE-TUNING OPEN LLM JUDGES TO OUTPERFORM GPT-5.2 (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Open-source models like GPT-OSS 120B and Qwen3 235B are fine-tuned
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to potentially outperform
GPT-5.2 on human preference tasks. RewardBench 2 is used for
evaluation, highlighting areas like Math and Safety where these models
excel. Cost-efficient, these open models also offer transparency,
enabling better alignment with specific use cases while significantly
reducing reliance on expensive, closed-source alternatives.

 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT AND MCP (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Context rot is unavoidable with today's models, and you cannot work
around it. The best way to deal with this is to leverage subagents.
The subagent approach provides a ton of flexibility in how problems
can be approached. It's not a perfect solution, but it is a lot better
than other current fixes in a lot of use cases, and it embraces the
limitations of the models. 

 NVIDIA PROPOSES GOLDEN GOOSE: UNLIMITED RLVR TASKS (18 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Golden Goose enables the synthesis of large-scale RL with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) tasks from unverifiable web text. The resulting
GooseReason dataset helps revive model performance in math, science,
and cybersecurity, surpassing prior state-of-the-art in multiple
domains.

 OPENAI QUIETLY LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR ADS IN CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 ChatGPT responses now contain references to ads in the source code.
While not visible to users yet in the UI, the addition of the code
signals that ChatGPT ads are moving from concept to near-launch. It is
likely that targeting and eligibility are already being tested. OpenAI
will sell ads on an impression basis. Early indications suggest they
won't be cheap. 

 JUDGMENT ISN'T UNIQUELY HUMAN (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Experts frequently underestimate AI's capabilities, as shown by Yann
LeCun's dismissal of AI learning real-world physics and a recent NYT
Op-Ed's claim that judgment is human-exclusive. AI models like GPT-3.5
and tools by Anthropic already demonstrate sophisticated
decision-making, challenging these assertions. Studies in "Science"
and "Nature" also reveal that AI often outperforms humans in complex
judgments, suggesting the need to reassess AI's role and potential in
decision-making contexts.
