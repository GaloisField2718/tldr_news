 HOW LOOM AI MAKES REMOTE WORK FEEL MORE HUMAN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In 2025, teams are rarely in the same physical space. Even with
return-to-office mandates, work is distributed between physical
locations (or ‘outsourced' to AI agents). Immediate, in-person
interactions are the exception rather than the norm.

To adapt to modern work challenges without creating an alienated and
atomized workforce, teams have to get better at asynchronous
communication. Shifting to an async collaboration model powered by
Loom [4] can transform the way teams work every day.

ebook to discover the best ways to make async collaboration a
productive and beneficial reality. Download it here [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI INTRODUCES THE INTELLIGENCE AGE (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI highlights the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the broader
impact of AI, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs. Its
Super Bowl ad positions AI as the next major tool in human progress,
emphasizing its role in augmenting creativity rather than replacing
human effort. 

 FRANCE'S $112 BILLION AI INVESTMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 French President Macron announced a massive AI investment to boost
innovation and international cooperation. He emphasized AI's role as
an assistant rather than a job replacement, with particular focus on
applications in healthcare. 

 ILYA SUTSKEVER'S STARTUP IN TALKS TO FUNDRAISE AT ROUGHLY $20B
VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SSI nearly quadruples its valuation from the previous round of
funding.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN REGRESSION, CLUSTERING, AND CLASSIFICATION
(23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper introduces a novel method for improving neural network
training in regression tasks that involves framing them as
classification problems using a learned target encoder-decoder pair.
The approach outperforms traditional regression methods by leveraging
the benefits of distributional target representation and smooth
interpolation between different objectives. 

 SCALING UP TEST-TIME COMPUTE WITH LATENT REASONING (34 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 3.5B model trained to do latent reasoning which also shows dramatic
improvement on math problems. The model itself is a recurrent
architecture. 

 BETTER GNN GENERALIZATION (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While maximizing spectral gap has been used to address over-squashing
in GNNs, this paper shows that minimizing it can also improve
generalization. The authors propose three new rewiring strategies to
enhance label-community alignment, homophily, and computational
efficiency.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 QUEST: STABLE TRAINING OF LLMS WITH 1-BIT WEIGHTS AND ACTIVATIONS
(GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations.
QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods:
accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of
weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal
fitting, and a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of
explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed
over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision
gradient. 

 DIAGEN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Agentic workflow for generating diagrams with language models. 

 BETTER PROGRAMMING ASSISTANCE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This work introduces a new conversational framework for programming
assistance that integrates coding history, current code, and user
instructions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IF YOU THINK ANYONE IN THE AI INDUSTRY HAS ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE
DOING, IT APPEARS THAT DEEPSEEK JUST ACCIDENTALLY LEAKED ITS USERS'
CHATS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Wiz researchers discovered unencrypted sensitive data in DeepSeek's
open-source AI model, exposing major security vulnerabilities. Despite
difficulties in contacting DeepSeek, the databases were secured within
an hour after the issue was reported. Wiz highlighted that such
security oversights indicate the service is not mature enough to
handle sensitive data. 

 TEAM SAYS THEY'VE RECREATED DEEPSEEK'S OPENAI KILLER FOR LITERALLY
$30 (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Jiayi Pan and his team at UC Berkeley recreated DeepSeek's R1-Zero
model for just $30, showcasing a shift towards cost-efficient AI
research. Their open-source model, "TinyZero," highlights potential
challenges to big tech's expensive AI infrastructures. The development
raises questions about the necessity of large-scale investments in AI.


 OPENAI SAYS ITS MODELS ARE MORE PERSUASIVE THAN 82 PERCENT OF REDDIT
USERS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI tested ChatGPT's persuasiveness against Reddit's ChangeMyView
forum and found that its current AI models rank as more persuasive
than humans in 82% of comparisons but still fall short of "superhuman"
levels. The company warns of potential risks if AI achieves
near-zero-cost human-level persuasive writing, as this could aid
biased journalism and scams. OpenAI is implementing measures to
monitor and mitigate AI-based persuasion, particularly regarding
political influence and large-scale manipulation.
