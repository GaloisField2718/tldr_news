HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TABLIB 800B TABULAR TOKEN DATASET (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.approximatelabs.com/blog/tablib?utm_source=tlrdai] 

 Dataset of tabular tokens to encourage the community to build Large
Data Models that better understand tabular data. It is the largest
publicly available tabular dataset - a compilation of 627 million
tables together with 867 billion tokens of contextual information.
TabLiB is available on Hugging Face. 

 IMPROVED ROCM SUPPORT (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/amd-extends-support-for-pytorch-machine-learning-development-on/ba-p/637756?utm_source=tldrai]


 AMD has improved support for its RDNA GPUs (including the RX 7900)
and Pytorch for more training options for AI projects. 

 STARTUP AIMS TO BUILD HUNDREDS OF CHIP FACTORIES WITH PREFAB PARTS
AND AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.fastcompany.com/90962875/nanotronics-cubefabs-prefab-chip-factories?utm_source=tldrai]


 Nanotronics is a New York-based industrial AI company that wants to
build an AI-enabled chip factory that can be assembled and expanded
modularly with prefab pieces. Its Cubefabs system uses AI to take away
the need for the specialization normally needed in a lab and allow
people who are not semiconductor experts to work at the facilities.
Each facility will need only about 30 people to operate. The bulk of
each facility can be flat-packed and put in a shipping container.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MULTIMODAL LEARNING WITHOUT PAIRED DATA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/MCR-PEFT/Ex-MCR?utm_source=tldrai] 

 The research introduces Ex-MCR, a novel method that efficiently
learns unified contrastive representations for multiple modalities
without needing paired data. By aligning existing Multi-modal
Contrastive Representations, Ex-MCR achieves top performance in tasks
like audio-visual retrieval and 3D object classification. 

 BOOSTING LIDAR-CAMERA DETECTION (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07084v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 The authors of this paper have created a new technique called
SupFusion to make LiDAR and camera systems work together better for
detecting things like cars or pedestrians. 

 ADVANCED HEAD POSE ESTIMATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07654v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Figuring out the direction someone's head is turned is important for
lots of tech applications. These researchers have developed a new way
to estimate head positions from any angle.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ENHANCED EARTH OBSERVATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/qaz670756/mmcd?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This study introduces a new method that combines digital surface
model (DSM) data and aerial images from different times to improve
change detection beyond just 2D perspectives. 

 LIBGEN TO TXT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/VikParuchuri/libgen_to_txt?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Libgen is likely a dataset in many closed models. While the legality
of this dataset for commercial use is under debate, researchers are
still using it to better understand data quality for language model
training. 

 MOSAICFUSION: A TOOL TO MAKE NEW IMAGES WITHOUT TRAINING (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/jiahao000/mosaicfusion?utm_source=tldrai] 

 MosaicFusion is like a magic tool that can create new pictures with
lots of objects without needing any prior learning. It does this in
two steps: first, it makes the picture, and then it creates a mask to
show where each object is.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW CONFERENCE FOR LANGUAGE MODELING (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://colmweb.org/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 With the dramatic increase in interest in language modeling. Many
existing ML conferences have been inundated with papers. This new
venue, organized by many prominent scientists, will be a great option
for publications.

 Although Wall Street investors have a hard time valuing and
understanding Meta‚Äôs open-source approach to AI, many in the tech
industry believe that positioning Llama similarly to Linux as a smart
play. 

 ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE IS ALREADY HERE (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/?utm_source=tldrai]


 Although today‚Äôs AI models aren‚Äôt perfect, there is still a
strong chance that they will be eventually recognized as the first
true examples of artificial general intelligence.
