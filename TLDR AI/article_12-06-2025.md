 AMPLITUDE'S NEW AI AGENTS IS A WHOLE NEW WAY TO BUILD DIGITAL
PRODUCTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There are plenty of digital analytics tools that ask you to trawl
through heaps of data in search of an insight you might never find.

But what if instead of a tool, you had a team of always-on AI analysts
that you lead?

Amplitude AI Agents [4] are that and more. They identify conversion
drops, design experiments, and take action. No more dashboard-digging.

→ Join the upcoming virtual session [4] to see Amplitude Agents in
the wild. You'll also hear from (human) AI leaders including Sarah Guo
of Conviction, Dmitry Pimenov of OpenAI, Matan Grinberg of Factory AI,
and Tony Gentilcore of Glean.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PHYSICAL WORLD MODEL BY META (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has announced V-JEPA 2, a new visual world model that enhances
physical reasoning for AI agents. The company also introduced three
benchmarks to assess model performance on real-world video-based
reasoning tasks. 

 THE BROWSER COMPANY LAUNCHES DIA, AN AI-FIRST BROWSER (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Dia integrates AI directly into the URL bar, allowing users to query
open tabs, generate drafts from their content, and build custom code
snippets through natural language. The Browser Company pivoted from
Arc after acknowledging its complexity limited mainstream adoption,
betting that embedding AI at the browser level will capture users who
currently switch between ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. 

 MISTRAL ANNOUNCES AI COMPUTE PLATFORM WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GPUS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 As an alternative to US and Chinese Cloud Providers, Mistral Compute
offers private AI stacks including GPUs, orchestration, and APIs to
attract highly-regulated enterprises.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ALPHAWRITE: TEST-TIME COMPUTE SCALING FOR WRITING (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 AlphaWrite generates story variants with different author styles and
themes, uses pairwise comparisons to rank quality, then evolves top
performers across multiple generations, demonstrating that creative
tasks can benefit from systematic inference-time compute scaling
beyond just math and coding domains. 

 THE RISE OF SYSTEMS OF CONSOLIDATION APPLICATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [9]


 The last twenty years were focused on building systems for storage
and engagement. The next era will focus on systems that consolidate
and act. Companies building these systems will control enterprise
workflows. Systems of consolidation will become the most valuable
software layer yet.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 THE DEVELOPER'S GUIDE TO AGENTIC AI, MCP AND A2A (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Lost in the latest AI jargon? Cut through the hype with this clear,
practical guide [10] to AI agents, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and
Agent2Agent (A2A). Understand how agents differ from models, and
explore how emerging protocols enable agents to interact with each
other, external APIs, and tools. Try it out in the Dynatrace
Playground [11] to see AI Observability in action. 

 CLAUDE SQUAD (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Claude Squad is a terminal app that manages multiple local agents in
separate workspaces, allowing users to work on multiple tasks
simultaneously. It can compute tasks in the background, manage
instances and tasks in one terminal window, review changes before
applying them, checkout changes before pushing them, and more. Each
task gets its own isolated git workspace, so there can be no
conflicts. A video demo is available in the repository. 

 WEAK-TO-STRONG DECODING FOR LLM ALIGNMENT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 WSD is a novel method where a small aligned model drafts the start of
a response, then a large base model continues it. This boosts
alignment without harming performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE DREAM OF A GENTLE SINGULARITY (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sam Altman recently published an essay called 'The Gentle
Singularity' where he talks about how humanity is close to building
digital superintelligence. This post breaks down Altman's essay,
looking at each passage to reveal the hidden meaning behind the words.
It is clear that Altman's post was made to convince people that
everything is going to be fine, when very clearly, the default is for
everything to not be fine. 

 CANVA NOW REQUIRES USE OF AI DURING DEVELOPER JOB INTERVIEWS (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Canva now requires developer candidates to use AI coding assistants
during interviews to better gauge real-world skills. The new process
evaluates proficiency in leveraging AI effectively and making sound
technical decisions, while still testing basic computer science
skills.
