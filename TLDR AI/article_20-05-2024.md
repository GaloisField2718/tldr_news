 AI IS ALREADY SOLVING REAL CYBERSECURITY PROBLEMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While some are worried about the use of AI in cyberattacks, Orca
Security is using it to build better defenses. This blog post [4]
shows how AI-powered security enables companies to:

 	* Navigate complex cloud environments by generating specific
remediation instructions and code [4] to mitigate cloud risks.
 	* Stay ahead of attackers with AI-powered search that helps
organizations understand which assets are vulnerable within minutes
[4] of a vulnerability being found.
 	* Tackle industry skills shortages [4] by simplifying tasks,
lowering skill thresholds, and suggesting optimal configurations.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WHAT HAPPENED TO OPENAI'S LONG-TERM AI RISK TEAM? (4 MINUTE READ) [6]


 OpenAI dissolved its superalignment team after the departures of
co-leads Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike and several other researchers.
This team, created to address long-term AI risks, will have its work
absorbed by other research efforts. 

 OPEN RELEASE OF GROK-1 (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI has released the weights and architecture for Grok-1. Grok-1 is a
Mixture-of-Experts model with 314 billion parameters. The released
model is a raw base model checkpoint from the Grok-1 pretraining
phase, which means that it is not fine-tuned for any specific
application. It was trained from scratch by xAI using a custom
training stack. 

 $16K G1 HUMANOID RISES UP TO SMASH NUTS, TWIST, AND TWIRL (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Unitree has released the first few details on its G1 Humanoid Agent,
a $16,000 robotic helper. The robot is equipped with 3D LiDAR sensors,
a depth camera, three-fingered grippers, and a 9,000-mAh battery pack.
It can recover from brutal kicks and punches, as seen in the short
demo video in the article. At around 35 kg, the robot can fold itself
down to 690x450x300-mm proportions for compact carry.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LORA LEARNS LESS AND FORGETS LESS (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LoRA is a popular way to fine-tune models to inject style or
knowledge. This paper explores the trade off between power and
forgetting when using LoRAs. The research finds that LoRAs are able to
learn less than full fine tuning, but maintain more of the original
‚Äúout of distribution‚Äù performance. 

 CHAMELEON EARLY FUSION MULTI-MODAL (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta has announced a natively multi-modal model called Chameleon that
operates on images and text simultaneously like GPT-4o. It outperforms
many alternative models. The Meta team has since far surpassed this
work on internal models. 

 GEMINI 1.5 TECHNICAL REPORT (153 PAGE PDF) [11] 

 Google's most recent family of models has an updated technical
report. There is little information about the models or the data used,
but there is significant information about the evaluation and safety
measures taken, which is an interesting window into large-scale
alignment.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MODEL EXPLORER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Google has released a model explorer that makes it easy to inspect
the computation graph of your models. It can be useful for debugging
and performance engineering. 

 RUN PALIGEMMA IN REAL TIME (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Using GPT-Fast, you can run the most recent Google VLM in real time.
This opens up a number of powerful downstream tasks as the model is
extremely easy to fine-tune for specific tasks. 

 EXPERTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Experts is the easiest way to create and deploy OpenAI's Assistants
and link them together as Tools to create a Panel of Experts system
with expanded memory and attention to detail.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE I/O 2024: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google kicked off its I/O developer conference with a two-hour
presentation containing a rapid-fire stream of announcements. This
article summarizes these announcements into an easy-to-read list. The
announcements include Firebase Genkit, an addition to the Firebase
platform aimed at making it easier for developers to build AI-powered
applications in JavaScript/TypeScript; LearnLM, a family of generative
AI models fine-tuned for learning; AI-generated quizzes on YouTube; a
new discovery feature for apps in Google Play; scam call detection;
Ask Photos, a feature that lets users search across their Google
Photos collection using natural language queries; and much more. 

 GAMMA RAISES $12M SERIES A (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Gamma raised $12M from Accel to reimagine presentations using AI. So
far, 60M+ Gammas (AI-generated slides) have been created across 18M+
users. 

 AI AGENT BUILDS GARPLE.COM (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Garple is a website that sells short, easy-to-say .com domains that
would make good startup names. All the code was written by an AI
coding agent.
