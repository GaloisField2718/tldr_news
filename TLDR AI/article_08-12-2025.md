 FRAMEWORK + SCORECARD: AI PROTOTYPING FOR PRODUCT LEADERS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 According to Forrester, 88% of engineering, product, and design
leaders think prototyping needs to happen earlier. Wait til late in
the lifecycle to surface changes and you'll get months of delays.

🤔 But to find issues when you still have time to fix them, you need
tools that create editable prototypes, not fully fleshed bad ideas. 

In this Miro guide [4], product leaders get a:

1️⃣ Question set to define requirements & priorities

2️⃣ AI prototyping landscape overview

3️⃣ Tooling evaluation framework + scorecard [4] 

Tackle problems early in the lifecycle by accelerating your
prototyping strategy. Get the guide to learn how.  [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META ACQUIRES AI DEVICE STARTUP LIMITLESS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has acquired Limitless, a startup known for its AI pendant that
records conversations. Limitless will cease hardware sales but
continue to offer support for a year. Its team will focus on
supporting Meta's existing AR and AI wearables rather than launching
new products. The acquisition comes amid rising competition in AI
hardware as major players like Meta expand their device offerings. 

 GOOGLE SET TO LAUNCH GEMINI NANO BANANA 2 FLASH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google plans to launch the Gemini Nano Banana 2 Flash model, which
matches the performance of the Nano Banana 2 Pro, at a lower cost. The
move targets a broader user base by providing high-quality outputs
suitable for large-scale deployments. Code references suggest an
announcement is imminent, aligning with Google's strategy of model
tiering for cost optimization. 

 NEXT CHATGPT UPGRADE IMMINENT FOLLOWING ‘CODE RED' DECLARATION (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI could be releasing GPT-5.2 as early as tomorrow. The update
will focus on speed, reliability, and customizability. It is aimed at
closing the gap that Google created with the release of Gemini 3 last
month. OpenAI had declared a 'code red' in response to Gemini 3's
release.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ARC PRIZE 2025 RESULTS & ANALYSIS (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The ARC Prize 2025 Score and Paper winners have been announced. 1,455
teams submitted 15,154 entries for the ARC Prize 2025. All ARC Prize
2025 winning solutions and papers were open-source. This post takes a
look at the winners and how ARC-AGI will push AI reasoning further in
2026. 

 TRAVERSING THE FRONTIER OF SUPERINTELLIGENCE (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Poetiq has established a new state-of-the-art on the ARC-AGI-1 and 2
benchmarks. Its approach of building intelligence on top of any model
allows it to integrate new models within hours of their release. The
company's core meta-systems produce optimized agents to automate the
extraction of knowledge for hard tasks that require complex reasoning.
This article looks at how Poetiq's team built its systems.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 ANNOUNCING RNJ-1: BUILDING INSTRUMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE (14 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Rnj-1 is a world-class pair of base and instruction-tuned large
language models. The 8B model roughly follows the open-source Gemma 3
architecture. The Rnj-1 Base and Instruct models compare favorably
against similarly sized open weight models. This post summarizes the
key capabilities of the models and covers the background behind their
development. 

 TITANS + MIRAS: HELPING AI HAVE LONG-TERM MEMORY (12 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Google Research has released two new papers introducing an
architecture (Titans) and a theoretical blueprint (MIRAS) that combine
the speed of recurrent neural networks with the accuracy of
transformers. Together, Titans and MIRAS advance the concept of
test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain
long-term memory. They introduce a meaningful shift toward real-time
adaptation. The architecture actively learns and updates its own
parameters as data streams in, enabling the model to incorporate new,
specific details into its core knowledge instantly. 

 CUTILE PYTHON (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 cuTile Python is a programming language for writing parallel kernels
for NVIDIA GPUs. It automatically leverages advanced hardware
capabilities while providing portability across different NVIDIA GPU
architectures. cuTile enables the latest hardware features without
requiring code changes.

 COMPUTER-SCIENCE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING GOT REWARDS WRONG (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 In reinforcement learning, the reward is part of the agent, not part
of the environment. Once we start thinking in terms of the reward
translation as being part of the agent, we can also start thinking of
ways in which the agent can affect the reward translation mechanism.
It could be dynamic and change across time, be tied to policy, or even
learned. The shift in perspective creates many possible options, just
by changing the notation - because notation matters. 

 GEMINI 3 PRO ADVANCES VISUAL REASONING (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's Gemini 3 Pro set new benchmarks in multimodal vision tasks,
excelling at document, screen, spatial, and video understanding with
enhanced visual reasoning capabilities.
