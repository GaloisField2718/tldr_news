Anysphere has introduced a fixed‑price Ultra tier that offers far
higher compute than Pro, made possible by long‑term deals with major
model
vendors. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CURSOR'S $200 ULTRA PLAN (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anysphere has introduced a fixed‑price Ultra tier that offers far
higher compute than Pro, made possible by long‑term deals with major
model vendors. 

 GEMINI 2.5 UPDATED AVAILABILITY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google released Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash to general availability,
debuted Flash‑Lite in preview, and introduced controllable
“thinking” budgets that improve reasoning accuracy while giving
developers flexibility. 

 SAM ALTMAN'S TAKE ON META'S $100M OFFERS (37 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 In a podcast, the OpenAI CEO confirmed Meta dangled nine‑figure
packages to lure researchers to its superintelligence team but said
virtually none defected, taking the opportunity to jab at Meta's
recruiting push.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW NOT TO LOSE YOUR JOB TO AI (37 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This career guide identifies skills that paradoxically become more
valuable as automation increases, including AI deployment, leadership,
and government relations. It advises knowledge workers to try to
leapfrog traditional entry-level positions entirely, advocating for
side projects and startup roles as AI hollows out established
corporate hierarchies. 

 UNDERSTANDING AND CODING THE KV CACHE IN LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Key-value (KV) caches store intermediate attention computations
during LLM inference to avoid redundant calculations. When generating
"Time flies fast" token by token, the model normally recomputes
attention for "Time" and "flies" at each step, but caching these
values delivers 5x speedups. This tutorial progresses from modifying a
124M parameter GPT model with basic cache buffers and position
tracking to production-ready optimizations like pre-allocated memory
and sliding windows to address the linear memory growth that becomes
prohibitive for long sequences. 

 OPENAI'S PRACTICAL GUIDE TO BUILDING AGENT (48 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This guide emphasizes starting with single agents before multi-agent
systems, using manager patterns where one agent coordinates others via
tool calls or decentralized handoffs for peer-to-peer task delegation.
Key insights include implementing guardrails as layered defenses
(LLM-based classifiers, regex filters, and moderation APIs), designing
tools for messy long-horizon tasks, and building human-in-the-loop
mechanisms triggered by failure thresholds or high-risk actions.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 HOW DELVE GENERATED $1M IN PIPELINE FROM JUST 4 TLDR NEWSLETTER ADS
(SPONSOR) [15] 

 Delve ran 4 placements across 2 TLDR newsletters and brought in 66
leads, with a meaningful chunk from enterprise. The result: $1M in
attributed pipeline and a 52x ROI.

The case study breaks down their strategy, results, and example ads.

Read the Delve case study. [15]

 REAL-TIME ACTION CHUNKING WITH LARGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Unlike chatbots or image generators, robots must operate in real time
- delays between inputs and outputs have a tangible effect on
performance. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have achieved
promising results in open-world generalization, they can be slow to
run. This article presents an algorithm called real-time chunking that
enables real-time execution without discontinuities. It works on any
diffusion- or flow-based VLA with no training-time changes. 

 SPATIOTEMPORAL ATTENTION FOR MI-EGG DECODING (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 TCANet layers multi‑scale convolutions, temporal compression, and
stacked self‑attention to model motor‑imagery EEG. 

 MINIMAX RELEASES OPEN-WEIGHT REASONING MODEL M1 (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 MiniMax's 456B parameter model uses a hybrid mixture-of-experts
architecture with "lightning attention" that processes 1 million token
contexts (8x DeepSeek R1) while using 25% fewer FLOPs at 100K token
generation lengths.

MISCELLANEOUS

 O3 TURNS PRO (22 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 o3-pro seems to provide better answers than o3, but it has a
significantly longer wait time. Using the API at scale seems
prohibitively expensive, so users should instead run parallel queries
using the chat interface. o3-pro serves the same niche as o3, so users
thinking of using Opus may prefer to use Opus rather than, or in
addition to, o3-pro. The 80% price cut on o3 seems more impactful than
o3-pro - o3-pro is still largely a 'special cases only' model. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED FROM BRIEFING 70+ LAWMAKERS ON THE THREAT FROM AI (23
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Briefings on AI risks revealed most UK parliamentarians lack in-depth
AI knowledge and face capacity constraints that limit research on AI
issues. The briefings were well-received, with one in three lawmakers
publicly supporting AI risk mitigation campaigns. Effective outreach
included persistent follow-ups and leveraging statements from notable
AI authorities to convey the seriousness of AI-related extinction
risks.
