 THE DEVELOPER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO USER MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Even if you‚Äôre a startup, you can‚Äôt afford to cut corners on auth
‚Äî especially when it comes to features like SSO.
This free (ungated) resource [3] covers the essentials of SaaS user
management ‚Äî from 101 topics [3] to more advanced concepts.

Get an easily digestible breakdown [3] of basics like SSO, MFA, and
sessions, then move on to more advanced topics - bot policies,
identity linking, UI considerations, just-in-time provisioning, and
more. Read the full guide on the WorkOS blog [3]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SAM ALTMAN AND JONY IVE SEEKING FUNDING FOR PERSONAL AI DEVICE (1
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Sam Altman and Jony Ive, former Apple design chief, have officially
joined forces to develop an AI-powered personal device that won't
resemble a smartphone. They are currently seeking funding of up to $1
billion. 

 HUGGING FACE TGI REVERTS TO OPEN SOURCE LICENSE (GITHUB COMMIT) [5] 

 Hugging Face‚Äôs popular and powerful inference server was briefly
licensed under non-commercial to try and prevent larger businesses
from hosting a competitive version. This didn't lead to improved
business outcomes but did diminish community involvement. It has
reverted to a more permissive license. 

 SECURING CANADA‚ÄôS AI ADVANTAGE (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $2.4 billion investment
package from Budget 2024 to reinforce Canada's AI sector. The package
includes funding for computing capabilities, support for AI start-ups,
and resources to ensure responsible AI adoption. These measures aim to
accelerate job growth, enhance productivity, and maintain Canada's
competitive edge in AI globally. The funds will also go towards
creating a Canadian AI Safety Institute and strengthening enforcement
of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH PROMPT AUTO-EDITING (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Prompt Auto-Editing (PAE) is a method developed by researchers to
advance text-to-image generation using diffusion models like Imagen
and Stable Diffusion. This innovative approach automates the
refinement of text prompts by dynamically adjusting the weights and
injection times of specific words, guided by online reinforcement
learning. 

 3D OBJECT RECOGNITION (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Seg-NN is a framework that streamlines the process of 3D
segmentation. By removing the need for extensive pre-training, these
models quickly adapt to new, unseen classes without the typical domain
gap issues. 

 A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF ML MODELS ADVANCING HEALTHCARE (48 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This comprehensive survey explores the potential of Healthcare
Foundation Models (HFMs) in transforming medical services. These
models, which are pre-trained on diverse data, are well-suited to
adapt to various healthcare tasks, potentially enhancing intelligent
healthcare services across numerous scenarios.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LLM.C (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 LLM training in simple, pure C/CUDA by Andrei Karpathy. No need for
250mb+ of PyTorch. 

 AIOS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 An LLM agent operating system that embeds a large language model into
Operating Systems as the brain of the OS, enabling an operating system
"with soul". 

 ANTHROPIC TOOL USE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic has launched a public beta allowing Claude AI to interact
with custom client-side tools provided in API requests. Developers
must use the 'anthropic-beta: tools-2024-04-04' header to access the
feature. Claude's functionality can be extended with detailed JSON
schemas for each tool.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SCALING WILL NEVER GET US TO AGI (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Neural networks' limited ability to generalize beyond their training
data restricts their reasoning and reliability, necessitating
alternative approaches to achieve artificial general intelligence. 

 AMERICANS‚Äô USE OF CHATGPT IS TICKING UP, BUT FEW TRUST ITS ELECTION
INFORMATION (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A Pew Research Center survey indicates ChatGPT usage among U.S.
adults has increased from 18% to 23% since July 2023, with upticks in
occupational, educational, and entertainment contexts. Young adults
and those with higher education are more likely to use ChatGPT.
Reflecting general wariness about AI and politics, 40% of Americans
distrust election information from ChatGPT. Despite tech companies'
efforts to combat AI-generated misinformation, only 2% of Americans
have used ChatGPT to seek election-related facts.
