HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

TINYCORP RAISES $5M TO BUILD DEEP LEARNING SOFTWARE FOR AMDS (4 MINUTE
READ)
[https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/05/24/the-tiny-corp-raised-5M.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Nvidia has a strong advantage in the GPU market. Much of that can be
attributed to their kernels and software supporting training and
inference workloads. AMD chips are super fast, but writing code for
them is impossibly painful. George Holtz and crew are now working to
write drivers from the ground up first for inference then maybe
training later. It would be a boon on compute constrained
organizations if they could use the cheaper AMD GPUs. 

SAM ALTMAN SHARES HIS OPTIMISTIC VIEW OF AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/26/sam-altman-shares-his-optimistic-view-of-our-ai-future/?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, expressed optimism about AI's future during
his European tour, emphasizing its potential uses such as in education
and stressing the need for a global regulatory framework that balances
protection and innovation. 

NEW SUPERBUG-KILLING ANTIBIOTIC DISCOVERED USING AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-65709834?utm_source=tldrai] 

AI was used to discover "abaucin," a new antibiotic effective against
the superbug Acinetobacter baumannii. The AI, trained with thousands
of known drugs, shortlisted potential antibiotics from over 6,000
untested compounds in 90 minutes. Although promising, abaucin requires
further tests and clinical trials. It is expected to be available
around 2030.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

A NEW METHOD FOR CORRECTING ERRORS IN CONVERTING TEXT TO SQL (14
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13073?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper focuses on improving how computers understand and convert
everyday language into SQL, a language used for managing and
manipulating databases. It introduces a new method that corrects
errors by looking at whole sections of code instead of individual
words, and uses a new representation for SQL queries that's closer to
how pre-existing code language models work, leading to a significant
improvement in accuracy. 

A HYBRID MODEL COMBINING THE STRENGTHS OF TRANSFORMERS AND RNNS (24
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048?utm_source=tldrai] 

This research introduces a new model called Receptance Weighted Key
Value (RWKV), which brings together the efficient parallelized
training of Transformers and the efficient operation of Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs). With its unique approach of utilizing a linear
attention mechanism, RWKV can be used like a Transformer or an RNN
during different stages, proving equally effective as Transformers,
but with more efficient use of computing resources. 

IMPROVING QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM THROUGH USER FEEDBACK (26 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12473?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers explore how a system that extracts answers to questions
can be constantly improved by feedback from human users. Through
experiments involving thousands of user interactions, we found that
user feedback significantly improved the system's performance over
time, including its ability to adapt to new topics or areas of
knowledge.

A THEOREM-BASED QUESTION-ANSWERING DATASET FOR TESTING LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/wenhuchen/TheoremQA?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have developed the first dataset for testing AI language
models using 800 question-answer pairs based on over 350 STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) theorems. This
dataset offers a new benchmark to measure an AI's ability to solve
complex, university-level problems using these theorems. 

LEARNING MINECRAFT WITH GPT4 WITHOUT TRAINING (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://voyager.minedojo.org/?utm_source=tldrai] 

GPT-4 is widely regarded as the most powerful language model to date.
However, because it is closed behind an API, we can‚Äôt train it for
novel tasks. Voyager uses code as the ‚Äúpolicy representation‚Äù and
uses the environment errors and performance as natural language
feedback. The set of code functions then allows GPT4 to iteratively
improve at mining diamond and other tasks.

A lawyer wrote his brief using ChatGPT, which hallucinated fake cases,
landing him in deep trouble. 

OPENAI HAS NO PLANS TO LEAVE EUROPE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/CVbJb?utm_source=tldrai] 

OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe, CEO Sam Altman said on Friday,
reversing a threat made earlier this week to leave the region if it
becomes too hard to comply with upcoming laws on artificial
intelligence.
