 HOW TO STAY AHEAD OF FRAUDSTERS IN THE AI ARMS RACE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bad actors use AI to test stolen credentials across thousands of
sites. They share attack patterns in real-time and automate
everything.

Meanwhile, many fraud-prevention teams are still working in silos and
are bogged down by manual processes.

The new playbook by Javelin and Plaid [4] looks at how companies can
close the gap with modern fraudsters, while making life easier for
honest users:

 	* Connect identity, device, and behavioral signals [4] across the
full customer journey
 	* Share intelligence between institutions to spot repeat offenders
 	* Monitor patterns across onboarding, login, and transaction
activity

Learn how to deliver smarter, more proactive fraud prevention, without
sacrificing user experience. Get the playbook. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE WORKING ON MCP SUPPORT TO ENABLE AGENTIC AI ON MAC, IPHONE, AND
IPAD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has begun to lay the groundwork for adopting Anthropic's Model
Context Protocol (MCP) in its latest round of betas. MCP allows AI
agents to interface with traditional platforms. The standard has been
widely adopted and has become a universal pathway for AI assistants to
plug into APIs and data sources. Apple plans to let developers use a
system-level MCP integration to expose actions and functionalities
within apps to AI platforms and agents. 

 OPENAI UNVEILS PLANS FOR SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS EXPANSION OF COMPUTING
POWER (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has laid out its vision for a $1 trillion build-out of
computing warehouses across the US and abroad. It announced five new
datacenter sites across the US, built with Oracle and SoftBank, which
together will bring online nearly 7 gigawatts of power. The company
envisions that it will need more than 20 gigawatts of computing
capacity to meet demand for ChatGPT. Each gigawatt is expected to cost
roughly $50 billion. 

 GOOGLE'S MIXBOARD FOR VISUAL CONCEPTING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google Labs' Mixboard is an AI-powered concept board that lets users
generate and refine visual ideas using text prompts, image editing,
and contextual generation tools. 

 PERPLEXITY EMAIL ASSISTANT LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Perplexity's new Email Assistant for Max subscribers integrates
directly with users' inboxes to draft replies, organize messages, and
schedule meetings.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GETTING AI TO WORK IN COMPLEX CODEBASES (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI coding agents are great for new projects or small changes, but
they often make developers less productive in large, established
codebases. This post discusses a family of techniques called 'frequent
intention compaction' that involves deliberately structuring how
context is fed to AI throughout the development process to improve
performance on large codebases. The technique has allowed a team to
use AI to handle Rust codebases with 300,000 lines of code, ship a
week's worth of work in a day, and maintain code quality that passes
expert review. It shows how AI for coding is actually a deeply
technical engineering craft. 

 SAMPLING AND STRUCTURED OUTPUTS IN LLMS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sampling is the process of selecting a token from a model's
vocabulary based on the probability distribution. Structured outputs
allow models to turn unstructured data into structured data. Together,
they both determine a model's next chosen token. Large language models
are extremely sensitive to the slightest variation in their system
prompts, templating, structured outputs, and sampling parameters.

 THE ATTACK SURFACE OF ON-DEVICE AI (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Running AI on your PC is transforming productivity - but like all
emerging tech, it comes with some security risk. Learn about the
tactics attackers use to gain entry to [12] your endpoints, and how
you can stay secure. Read the eBook by Dell and Intel [12] 

 GPT-5-CODEX IS LIVE IN THE RESPONSES API (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GPT-5-Codex is now live in OpenAI's Responses API. It is also
available in the Codex CLI via API key. The model has been optimized
and is not a drop-in replacement for other models. A link to a
prompting guide for the model is available. 

 CHROME DEVTOOLS (MCP) FOR YOUR AI AGENT (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Chrome DevTools Model Context Protocol (MCP) server brings the
power of Chrome DevTools to AI coding assistants. It allows AI coding
assistants to debug web pages directly in Chrome and benefit from
DevTools debugging capabilities and performance insights. Use cases
include verifying code changes in real-time, diagnosing network and
console errors, simulating user behavior, and automating performance
audits. A video showing how the Chrome Dev Tools MCP server works is
available. 

 BUILD MORE POWERFUL VOICE AGENTS WITH THE GEMINI LIVE API (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Google has significantly improved function calling and enhanced
proactive audio capabilities in the Gemini Live API to handle
interruptions, pauses, and side conversations gracefully. It plans to
roll out support for thinking capabilities next week. Details about
the recent updates to the Gemini Live API are available in the link
along with video demos of the new capabilities.

 ABUNDANT INTELLIGENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI wants to create a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new
AI infrastructure every week. The project will take several years and
require innovation at every level of the stack. A lot of the
infrastructure will be built in the US. The company will release more
details about its plans and partners over the next couple of months. 

 THE 28 AI TOOLS I WISH EXISTED (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 There has never been a better time in the history of computing to
build software. Advances in AI now make it possible to build apps with
new capabilities. This post lists a few ideas for builders to
consider. 

 MICROSOFT LOOKS TO BUILD AI MARKETPLACE FOR PUBLISHERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Microsoft's Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM) will launch as a
pilot program with a limited set of publishers. The company's Copilot
assistant will be the first AI buyer on the marketplace. Most AI
companies have focused on brokering licensing deals that pay
publishers upfront for access to content rather than on a per-use
basis. PCM will help Microsoft deepen its relationship with publishers
as it expands its AI capabilities and restructures its relationship
with OpenAI.
