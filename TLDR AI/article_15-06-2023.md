EUROPEANS TAKE A MAJOR STEP TOWARD REGULATING AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/XWQZJ?utm_source=tldrai]

The European Parliament has passed a draft law for regulating
artificial intelligence (AI). The law restricts the use of AI in
certain high-risk areas, such as in the legal system. It would also
require companies to disclose more information about the data they use
to create AI systems. 

SYNTHESIA RAISES $90M SERIES C (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.synthesia.io/post/series-c?utm_source=tldrai]

Synthesia announced a $90M Series C funding round led by Accel. The
funds will boost their mission to make video creation easy for
everyone, driving their AI research and enhancing their collaborative
video editing platform with better avatar technology, real-time
collaboration, and enhanced sharing functionality. 

AMD REVEALS NEW AI CHIP TO CHALLENGE NVIDIA‚ÄôS DOMINANCE (3 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/13/amd-reveals-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-nvidias-dominance.html?utm_source=tldrai]

AMD announced its latest AI-dedicated GPU, the MI300X, set to ship
later this year. The chip poses a robust challenge to Nvidia's
dominance in the AI chip market. This launch aligns with AMD's
strategic focus on AI, a sector forecasted to grow from $30 billion to
over $150 billion by 2027. Designed for large language models, the
MI300X, with its superior memory capacity and support for ROCm
software, could drive down costs of AI applications and tap into
Nvidia's market share.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

IMPROVING ANOMALY DETECTION (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07114v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTAD) is important for
many real-world applications like smart surveillance and risk
management. In this study, the authors create a new system called
Coupled Attention-based Neural Network (CAN) to better detect these
anomalies. It uses a special network that can adapt to changing data,
making it more accurate in different scenarios. 

SOVIT: A MORE EFFICIENT VISION TRANSFORMER (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13035?utm_source=tldrai]

This research presents SoViT, a vision transformer that has been
optimized for size and shape using advanced scaling methods, resulting
in performance competitive with much larger models, but with less
computation. Through tests across various tasks like image
classification, captioning, visual question answering, and zero-shot
transfer, SoViT demonstrates its effectiveness, indicating a new
direction for optimizing, rather than simply scaling up vision models.


A MORE EFFECTIVE RGB-D OBJECT DETECTOR (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03630v1?utm_source=tldrai]

In this research, the authors created a better way to detect objects
in combined color-depth (RGB-D) images using a new training method
that requires less supervision and separates different kinds of data
effectively.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

A TOOLKIT FOR COMPREHENSIVE EVENT EXTRACTION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/thu-keg/omnievent?utm_source=tldrai]

OmniEvent is an open-source toolkit designed for event extraction,
encompassing both event detection and argument extraction processes.
The toolkit offers a comprehensive approach for various paradigms,
providing fair and unified evaluations on commonly-used English and
Chinese datasets. Its modular design ensures a high degree of
extensibility. 

OPEN CODE MODEL BEATS CHATGPT AT CODING TASKS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/WizardCoder?utm_source=tldrai]

Closed models are strong because they are actually code models
disguised as language models. A lot of the open language models fall
short because they don't gain reasoning skills from massive code
pretraining. Here, we have Starcoder models instruction tuned on Evol
instructions and achieving an astonishing 57 on the HumanEval
Benchmarks. Models and code are available. 

AUDIOCRAFT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft?utm_source=tldrai]

Audiocraft is a PyTorch library for deep learning research on audio
generation. At the moment, it contains the code for MusicGen, a
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-music model.

BIPARTISAN BILL DENIES SECTION 230 PROTECTION FOR AI (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2023/06/14/hawley-blumenthal-bill-section-230-ai?utm_source=tldrai]

Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal want to clarify that the
internet's bedrock liability law does not apply to generative AI, per
a new bill introduced Wednesday that was shared exclusively with
Axios. 

RESEARCHERS WARN OF MODEL COLLAPSE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-feedback-loop-researchers-warn-of-model-collapse-as-ai-trains-on-ai-generated-content/?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have warned that AI models that are trained on
AI-generated content can collapse, meaning they forget the true
underlying data distribution and produce erroneous responses. This can
lead to problems such as discrimination and a distorted perception of
reality. 

MICROSOFT‚ÄôS SATYA NADELLA IS BETTING EVERYTHING ON AI (12 MINUTE
READ) [https://archive.ph/WIHTZ?utm_source=tldrai]

Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, has led the company to an impressive
resurgence in AI tech by integrating OpenAI's language model into Bing
via a chatbot named Sydney and launching Copilot, an AI tool that
automates aspects of coding. Despite initial hiccups, Microsoft is
becoming a heavyweight in the AI arena. The company sees its $10B
investment in OpenAI as a key strategic move. Nadella views AI as an
empowerment tool for humans and emphasizes the importance of aligning
AI with core human values while continuing to explore its potential
and manage unintended consequences.
