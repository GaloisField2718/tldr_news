CARVING 3D CLOTHED HUMANS USING 2D DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS (3
MINUTE READ) [https://snuvclab.github.io/chupa/?utm_source=tldrai]

If you use a diffusion model to generate 2D normal maps, which contain
distance and shape information, and then use a 3D reconstruction
algorithm, you can generate realistic 3D human avatars using an
underlying body model. This is useful for synthetic avatars and
character creation.

PRODUCT-LED AI FROM GREYLOCK (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://greylock.com/greymatter/seth-rosenberg-product-led-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]

Investors are shifting focus from backing AI enablers like NVIDIA to
supporting founders building transformative, AI-first products that
redefine work and life. Three major AI-first opportunities include
AI-first networks and marketplaces transitioning from human-driven to
algorithmic content creation, redefining enterprise software
categories where AI becomes the main feature, and AI "co-pilot"
augmenting services, especially in areas like wealth management. The
potential extends beyond software, tapping into vast service markets.
