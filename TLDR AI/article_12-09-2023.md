PROJECT GUTENBERG RELEASES THOUSANDS OF AI AUDIOBOOKS (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03926?utm_source=tldrai]

In collaboration with Microsoft, thousands of open-domain books have
been transcribed with state-of-the-art text-to-speech. They're
available on most streaming platforms. Information about the process
is included in the link.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

SPEED UP SPECULATIVE DECODING WITHOUT A DRAFT MODEL (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://together.ai/blog/medusa?utm_source=tldrai]

Language model inference is generally slow because these models are
heavily memory-bound. So people have introduced speculative decoding
using a smaller draft model to ‚Äúrun ahead‚Äù and offer suggestions
to the large model. This works well, but it‚Äôs complicated to
implement, and finding a good draft model is tough. Instead, you can
create a Medusa model that acts as its own draft by splitting off
activations from various internal stages. This speeds up Llama 2x
without compromising performance. 

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND REASONING ABOUT PICTURES (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04461v1?utm_source=tldrai]

The authors of this study have created a way to test how well
vision-language models can also think logically about what they see. 

MAKING SELF-DRIVING CARS SMARTER WITH LANGUAGE PROMPTS (15 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04379v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This project introduces NuPrompt, a new set of instructions in
everyday language that helps self-driving cars understand and track
objects around them better. It works really well!

CAN LLMS REASON? (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://aiguide.substack.com/p/can-large-language-models-reason?utm_source=tldrai]

The debate surrounding large language models concerns whether they
possess human-like reasoning abilities or rely on memorization and
pattern-matching, with studies showing mixed results. Evaluating LLMs
for true abstract reasoning is challenging due to their tendency to
excel in tasks related to their training data, necessitating further
research for clarification. 

PATTERNS FOR BUILDING LLM-BASED SYSTEMS & PRODUCTS (66 MINUTE READ)
[https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/?utm_source=tldrai]

This article shares seven practical patterns for integrating large
language models into systems: measuring performance, adding recent
knowledge, fine-tuning for tasks, caching to save time/cost, ensuring
quality output, managing errors, and harnessing user feedback. 

ANOTHER GROUP OF WRITERS IS SUING OPENAI OVER COPYRIGHT CLAIMS (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/11/23869145/writers-sue-openai-chatgpt-copyright-claims?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI faces a lawsuit from writers alleging illegal use of their
copyrighted works to train ChatGPT. They argue that ChatGPT's
capabilities to summarize and analyze their content indicate direct
training on their works, constituting copyright infringement. This
follows similar suits from other authors against OpenAI.
