GOOGLE CEO SUNDAR PICHAI SAYS SEARCH TO INCLUDE CHAT AI (3 MINUTE
READ) [https://archive.ph/b1zS4?utm_source=tldrai] 

Google plans to add conversational artificial-intelligence features to
its flagship search engine, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai
said, as it deals with pressure from chatbots such as ChatGPT and
wider business issues. Advances in AI would supercharge Google‚Äôs
ability to answer an array of search queries, Mr. Pichai said in an
interview with The Wall Street Journal. He dismissed the notion that
chatbots posed a threat to Google‚Äôs search business, which accounts
for more than half of revenue at parent Alphabet Inc. 

GPT-4 IS A REASONING ENGINE (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-is-a-reasoning-engine?utm_source=tldrai]


The author discusses the importance of knowledge databases in AI
progress and how personal knowledge repositories can be valuable. They
emphasize that advances in AI usefulness will come from improvements
in its ability to access the right knowledge at the right time, rather
than just from its reasoning powers. The author also highlights the
role of vector databases in storing and making information available
to AI applications and the potential value of personal knowledge bases
in customizing AI experiences. 

SEGMENT - DETECT - IN PAINT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything?utm_source=tldrai]


The new segment anything model is extremely proficient at segmenting
objects in an image. Dino is a universal detection model and stable
diffusion is an image generation model. If you combine the three of
these you get an extremely powerful segmentation, detection,
generation pipeline. Once you add the final piece of Blip in the mix
you can generate captions for any portion of an image.

A RECIPE FOR TRAINING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://wandb.ai/craiyon/report/reports/Recipe-Training-Large-Models--VmlldzozNjc4MzQz?utm_source=tldrai]


Most people using AI tools haven‚Äôt trained large (>1B parameters)
models often. There are a lot of things that change as you scale the
model up. This report has a nice collection of useful tips to keep in
mind when you are trying to train a larger model. It covers things
like initialization, experimentation strategies, and gives some
example tools you might want to use. 

ML PAPERS OF THE WEEK (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Papers-of-the-Week?utm_source=tldrai] 

Another great list of papers to refer to regularly. There is lots of
hype circulating online at the moment and so it is good to get back to
the source sometimes and understand the trends. There are many lists
like this one, but it seems high quality and thoughtfully curated. 

FULL PROOF GENERATION WITH PROOF REPAIR (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04910?utm_source=tldrai] 

One common problem with generative language models is their propensity
to hallucinate. Folks have pointed out that sometimes code these
models generate is subtly wrong, but looks plausible. The act of
verifying is sometimes more important than generating in this case.
Verification is hard though, especially for code. This paper studies
proof generation which can be checked by a formal system. There are
lots of great insights in this work, my favorite is that when given
error messages, the system can prove 1.5% more proofs.

AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE LANGCHAIN TOOLS OR CHATGPT PLUGINS (GITHUB
REPO)
[/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://github.com/hey-pal/toolkit-ai?utm_source=tldrai]


This is a fun glimpse into the future where AI builds tools for
itself. In this case, you can specify a high level description of what
you want your plugin to do - and this tool will generate the code
necessary to build a plugin that attempts your task. 

LLAMA.CPP PROJECT REVOLUTIONIZES META'S LANGUAGE MODEL ACCESS (5
MINUTE READ) [https://justine.lol/mmap/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Georgi Gerganov's llama.cpp project optimizes LLaMA performance,
boasting 100x faster load times and halved memory usage, enhancing the
user experience on edge and personal computer devices. 

INST-INPAINT: INSTRUCTING TO REMOVE OBJECTS WITH DIFFUSION MODELS
(GITHUB REPO) [http://instinpaint.abyildirim.com/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Introducing Inst-Inpaint, a novel inpainting framework that seamlessly
removes objects from images based on natural language input,
eliminating the need for time-consuming binary masks. Using the
GQA-Inpaint dataset, the framework outperforms GAN and diffusion-based
baselines, demonstrating quantitative and qualitative improvements.

PRETRAINING GAUSSIAN PROCESSES (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/04/pre-trained-gaussian-processes-for.html?utm_source=tldrai]


A main pillar of machine learning is optimization. It can be used for
all sorts of interesting problems, and bayesian optimization even
allows it to work under uncertainty. There are some drawbacks, mainly
around the need for experts to tune the models. This new work
pretrains gaussian process models which are used for bayesian
optimization on novel problems much more quickly.

PYTHON OPTIMAL TRANSPORT UPDATE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://pythonot.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Optimal Transport theory is a field with a rich history that has fully
embraced computation. One of the standard frameworks has received an
upgrade which improves speed, adds examples, and increases general
reliability. If you want to compare two distributions, this is likely
a good place to start. 

SAVE MONEY BY REDUCING YOUR GPT-4 PROMPT (1 MINUTE READ)
[/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.promptreducer.com/?utm_source=tldrai] 

A really fun tool that lets you reduce the number of tokens you send
to OpenAI by pseudo-compressing them into a bunch of emojis that GPT-4
seems to associate with the original prompt. It uses a custom prompt
and asks GPT-4 to reversibly compress the string to ‚Äúfit in a
tweet‚Äù, the outputs aren‚Äôt always exact and it doesn‚Äôt always
work.
