 FYI: AI IS ALREADY MAKING ONE MILLION PHONE CALLS A DAY ON BEHALF OF
SOME COMPANIES 🤯 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 👋 Say hi to Bland, the world's most realistic AI phone-calling
agent [4]

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It
can:

🗣️ Respond in any voice or language.

🦾 It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for
some of the world's largest businesses.

For enterprises [5], it's been a financial game changer across sales,
operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect
employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, give it a call yourself [4].

Or TLDR readers can get exclusive access to an even more advanced

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI 12 DAYS OF SHIPMAS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI will be having 12 live streams over the next 12 days to ship
new product and model features. 

 META'S NUCLEAR ENERGY PLANS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta announced plans to collaborate with nuclear energy developers
through a new request for proposals. The initiative aims to add 1-4
gigawatts of nuclear capacity in the U.S. to support Meta's AI
innovation and sustainability efforts. 

 AWS REINVENT TOP ANNOUNCEMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS announced various additions and tools including bringing prompt
routing and caching to its Bedrock LLM service at AWS re:Invent 2024.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GENIE 2: A LARGE-SCALE FOUNDATION WORLD MODEL (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Genie 2 is a large scale latent diffusion model for world generation.
It works with character control as input and is also classifier free.
The outputs are stunning and maintain control and consistency over
time. 

 MOTION PROMPTING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Motion Prompting is a method that trains a video generation model
with novel input types. Instead of just text or an image, it uses
text, first image frame, and a tracking field of pixels. This then
allows for novel control at inference time where it can provide a new
pixel field (e.g., for an object moving in a new direction) and
generate a video based on that. The method is extremely compelling,
but not open sourced. 

 A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY FOR REMOTE SENSING VLMS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository offers a comprehensive survey for remote sensing with
the integration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 FREE PROCESS REWARDS WITHOUT PROCESS LABELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Process reward models (PRMs) offer finer-grained feedback by
evaluating reasoning trajectories step-by-step, unlike outcome reward
models (ORMs), which assess entire responses. However, training PRMs
requires detailed intermediate annotations, posing significant
challenges. This paper shows that an implicit PRM can be derived at no
additional cost by training an ORM on response-level labels using
log-likelihood ratios of policy and reference models, enabling
optimization without requiring specific loss objectives. 

 DYNAMIC 4-BIT QUANTIZATION (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Unsloth team aims to shrink a 20GB language model into 5GB
without sacrificing accuracy. There are many algorithms that attempt
this, but there are a number of challenges around outliers and
compressibility. Llama is a famously hard model to quantize. The
method selectively avoids quantizing certain parameters, which greatly
improves overall accuracy. 

 TACKLING REPETITIVE IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 AccDiffusion v2 improves diffusion models for generating
higher-resolution images without training, addressing challenges like
object repetition and local distortion. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPTIMIZING AI INFERENCE AT CHARACTER AI (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Character AI has a strong inference pipeline. In this post, the team
walks through their int8 quantization and flash attention 3
implementation. It's a good read for folks interested in serving large
language models at scale. 

 CERTAIN NAMES MAKE CHATGPT GRIND TO A HALT, AND WE KNOW WHY (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's ChatGPT employs hard-coded filters to prevent the AI from
generating false statements about specific individuals, leading to
broken conversations when these names are mentioned. This approach
stems from past incidents like defamation lawsuits against OpenAI,
prompting the company to restrict outputs related to contentious
names. The hard-coded filters can pose challenges as they limit
ChatGPT's functionality and leave the system vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. 

 FINETUNING LLM JUDGES FOR EVALUATION (52 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Evaluating LLMs has become challenging due to their complex and
open-ended outputs. Traditional evaluation relies on human judgment,
which is detailed but inefficient. Thus, automatic metrics and
model-based evaluations like LLM-as-a-Judge are crucial for scalable
assessment. Innovations such as specialized fine tuned judges (e.g.,
Prometheus) and synthetic data generation are enhancing LLM
evaluation's precision and adaptability across diverse tasks and
domains.
