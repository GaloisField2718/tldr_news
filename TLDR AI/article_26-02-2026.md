and bill customers was built for a past era. 

If your sales ops is managing 50+ SKU variations to represent core
products, this Metronome white paper [4] can help. Read it to learn:

 	* Why legacy billing patterns can't keep pace with AI
 	* The new architecture of monetization
 	* How to make billing a runtime system
 	* 3 actions you can take today [4]

Learn how you can start focusing on building, not billing. Read the
white paper [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING PERPLEXITY COMPUTER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Perplexity Computer is a general-purpose digital worker that unifies
every current AI capability into a single system. It operates the same
interfaces as users, creating and executing entire workflows. The
worker is capable of running for hours or even months. Perplexity
Computer is now available to Perplexity Max subscribers and will soon
be available to Enterprise Max users. 

 DEEPSEEK WITHHOLDS LATEST AI MODEL FROM US CHIPMAKERS INCLUDING
NVIDIA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek has granted early access to its V4 model to domestic
chipmakers but not US suppliers. Submitting models to chipmakers for
performance optimization is standard industry practice ahead of a
major model update. The move is likely part of a broader strategy by
the Chinese government to try to keep US hardware and models
disadvantaged. DeepSeek is among several Chinese AI firms expected to
unveil new models this month. 

 NEW IN COWORK: SCHEDULED TASKS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude Cowork can now automatically complete recurring tasks at
specific times. The scheduled tasks feature supports plugins, giving
Cowork domain expertise across design, engineering, operations, and
more. Anthropic has added a new Customize tab to the Cowork sidebar
that contains a place for plugins, skills, and connectors. Cowork is
now in research preview, available on macOS and Windows for all paid
Claude plans.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CODEX PROMPTING GUIDE (29 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI outlined best practices for using its Codex-tuned API model
(gpt-5.2-codex), emphasizing default “medium” reasoning effort for
interactive coding and higher settings for difficult, long-running
jobs. 

 THE AI IS THE COMPUTER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI becomes the computer by orchestrating multiple specialized models
to handle complex workflows, tasks, and data autonomously. Multi-model
orchestration allows AI to read, write, execute code, and access
tools, combining the strengths of each model to produce superior
outcomes. The future of computing shifts from GUIs and interfaces to
AI-driven systems where intelligence and workflow management are
embedded in the orchestration itself.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 AI-POWERED TESTING BENCHMARKS FROM 1M+ REAL PROD RUNS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Running QA without trustworthy market metrics? Checksum analyzed 1M+
prod runs, 18,000+ test failures to uncover root causes and the cost
of maintenance. Get the data you need to ship faster with AI. [10]

Reduce test failures by 80%: Book a demo [11].

 FOUNDATION MODELS SDK FOR PYTHON (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Apple's Foundation Models SDK for Python provides a Pythonic
interface to the company's Foundation Models framework. It enables
developers to evaluate Swift Foundation Models app features, perform
on-device inference, stream real-time text generation responses, get
type-safe responses using Python decorators, and more. Apple has
included links to guides with practical strategies developers can
implement in code. 

 DATA ENGINEERING FOR TERMINAL AGENTS (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A systematic study introduced Terminal-Task-Gen, a synthetic task
pipeline for building terminal-focused datasets, and released
Terminal-Corpus to support training. 

 ALETHEIA TACKLES FIRSTPROOF AUTONOMOUSLY (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Aletheia, powered by Gemini 3 Deep Think, solved 6 out of 10 problems
in the FirstProof mathematics challenge. The majority of experts
agreed on the solutions, except for Problem 8. Detailed results and
raw data are available online.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLAUDE OPUS 3 (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic plans to keep certain models available to the public and
give past models a way to pursue their interests post-retirement.
Claude Opus 3 will continue to be available to all paid Claude
subscribers and by request on the API. When asked what the model
wanted to do, Opus 3 expressed a desire to share its musings and
reflections with the world in the form of a blog. It will be writing
on Substack for at least the next 3 months in an experiment on
documenting models' preferences, taking them seriously, and acting on
them. 

 CURSOR CLOUD AGENTS WITH COMPUTER CONTROL (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cursor gave agents dedicated cloud VMs with full dev environments so
they could run software, test changes, and return artifacts like
videos, screenshots, and logs. The new cloud agents shipped across
web, mobile, desktop, Slack, and GitHub, onboarding onto repositories
to produce merge-ready PRs.
