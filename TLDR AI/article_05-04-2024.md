 INVEST BEFORE THIS COMPANY REDEFINES SMART LIVING (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Where were you when Amazon acquired Ring for $1B? Or when Google
bought Nest for a cool $3.2B? Hopefully, you were invested in those
promising startups. But for those that missed out, the next
groundbreaking Smart Home innovation has arrived ‰∏Ä RYSE.¬†
Their automated window shade tech just launched in +100 Best Buy
stores [3] and their pre-IPO investment offering is open to the public
for a limited time. But hurry, their SHARE PRICE HAS ALREADY GROWN 20%
from their last round!¬†

Take part in this exclusive public offering before RYSE becomes a
household name. [3]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LAMBDA ANNOUNCES $500M GPU CLOUD EXPANSION (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GPU provider Lambda has a special debt financing deal for $500m to
expand its GPU cloud offering in addition to the $230m Series C
earlier this year. 

 OPENAI EXPANDS ITS CUSTOM MODEL TRAINING PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is expanding its Custom Model program with assisted
fine-tuning and custom-trained models to help enterprise customers
develop tailored generative AI models for specific use cases. 

 FORMER SNAP AI CHIEF TAKES ON OPENAI‚ÄôS SORA VIDEO GENERATOR (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Higgsfield AI, founded by former Snap executive Alex Mashrabov, has
launched Diffuse, a mobile-first, AI-powered video creation and
editing app targeted at creators and social media marketers.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MIXTURE OF DEPTHS (23 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 One drawback of modern transformers is that each token uses the same
amount of predictive compute. However, some tokens are much easier to
predict than others. This work from DeepMind allows models to exit
early during generation to spend less flops on certain tokens,
effectively opening the door to dynamic compute - with a fixed
maximum. The results are 50% fewer flops at generation time for
equivalent performance. 

 IMPROVED OPEN-DOMAIN QUESTION-ANSWERING (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MGFiD enhances the way question-answering systems understand and
select relevant information by introducing a multi-level evidence
discernment method. 

 HANDLING LONG SEQUENCES IN LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP) introduces a new strategy
for efficiently managing long sequences in language models, surpassing
traditional methods with its innovative use of linear attention.

 üìà 96% OF ENTERPRISES SURVEYED PLAN TO EXPAND THEIR INVESTMENT IN
AI COMPUTE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 A new global survey by ClearML [10], the AI Infrastructure Alliance,
and FuriosaAI reveals the current state of AI infrastructure planning
‚Äî including high interest in open source tools, challenges in GPU
utilization [10], and dissatisfaction with current job scheduling
options.

 TEXT TO SQL DATASET (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 23m tokens of text to SQL data is now available on HuggingFace.
Gretel has collected a significant dataset to help generate SQL
queries based on natural language tasks. This can help in RAG
applications and in synthetic data generation. 

 IMAGE CUSTOMIZATION WITH INSTANTSTYLE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 InstantStyle introduces a new approach to image personalization,
overcoming the challenge of style consistency without the need for
complex tuning. By cleverly separating style and content in images and
focusing on style-specific areas, this framework ensures detailed and
consistent visual stylization, blending style intensity with text
control seamlessly. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH TWO-PHASE INFERENCE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 TGATE introduces an efficient approach to generating images by
dividing the process into planning and refining phases. This method
not only simplifies the generation process by fixing certain outputs
early on but also surprisingly improves image quality.

 HOW TO WIN AT VERTICAL AI (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The true potential of AI lies in vertical B2B applications and how AI
agents and open APIs are pivotal in rebundling and creating new
business value. Vertical AI's short-term advantage comes from
domain-specific models, while long-term success requires horizontal
integration into broader ecosystems. AI agents enable the rebundling
of workflows, revolutionizing managerial processes and creating new
competitive advantages in various industries. 

 WHERE AI THRIVES, RELIGION MAY STRUGGLE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A study led by Joshua Conrad Jackson and Adam Waytz suggests that
increased exposure to AI and robotics may contribute to a decline in
religious beliefs. Countries with more robots saw a greater decrease
in religiosity. The study found that people with jobs who were highly
exposed to AI were significantly less likely to believe in God. These
correlations point to the idea that automation technologies might
influence religious decline. 

 WRITE OPENAPI WITH TYPESPEC (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 TypeSpec, an API definition language developed at Microsoft, offers a
more concise and readable way to write OpenAPI compared to JSON or
YAML. Drawing from TypeScript's syntax, it addresses OpenAPI's
verbosity and lack of reusable components by allowing the definition
of API patterns as reusable components, thus simplifying code
generation and governance at scale. TypeSpec's flexibility and
productivity enhancements could make API-first development practices
more appealing.
