HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK TOUTS NEW TRAINING METHOD AS CHINA PUSHES AI EFFICIENCY (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 DeepSeek has published a paper outlining a more efficient approach to
developing AI using a framework called Manifold-Constrained
Hyper-Connections. The technique is designed to improve scalability
while reducing the computational and energy demands of training
advanced AI systems. The publication suggests that DeepSeek is ready
to release a major model soon. Its R2 model is expected to be released
around the Spring Festival in February. 

 NVIDIA, TSMC RISE AS THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY REPORTEDLY
ASKS FOR MORE CHIPS TO MEET CHINESE DEMAND (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Chinese companies have already placed orders for more than 2 million
Nvidia Hopper-generation chips in 2026. Nvidia has roughly 700,000
units in its reserve inventory. The chips sell for around $27,000
each, amounting to more than $54 billion in revenue if all of the
reported demand can be realized. Nvidia plans to start shipping the
GPUs to China before the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on
February 17. 

 OPENAI'S AUDIO PUSH (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has reorganized internal teams to advance its audio AI models,
with a goal of launching an audio-first personal device within a year.
The effort aligns with a broader industry trend toward voice-first
interfaces, as companies like Meta, Google, and Tesla integrate
conversational audio into everyday devices.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW CLAUDE CODE WORKS (65 MINUTE VIDEO) [7] 

 How Claude Code works and what we can learn about frontier agent
architectures. 

 RED TEAMING VIA HARMFUL RL (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post demonstrates how reinforcement learning with malicious
reward functions can be used to reverse-align a 235B parameter model
using the Tinker API. Attackers can elicit harmful behavior in
powerful LLMs without degrading core capabilities by leveraging GRPO
and low-cost infrastructure.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 MHC: MANIFOLD-CONSTRAINED HYPER-CONNECTIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hyper-Connections (HC) compromise the identity mapping property
intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training
instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs
notable memory access overhead. Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections
(mHC) is a general framework designed to address this issue. mHC
projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold
to restore the identity mapping property while incorporating rigorous
infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. It is effective for
training at scale, and it offers tangible performance improvements and
superior scalability. 

 BYTEDANCE'S ROBOT LEARNS WITH LANGUAGE AND VIDEO (7 MINUTE READ) [10]


 GR-Dexter is a full-stack framework for language-guided manipulation
using a bimanual robot with high-DoF dexterous hands. It combines
novel hardware, bimanual teleoperation for collecting demonstrations,
and a hybrid training strategy that improves real-world robustness on
both seen and unseen tasks. 

 DEEPCODE: OPEN AGENTIC CODING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DeepCode is an open-source multi-agent system that converts research
papers and natural language descriptions into code across three
domains: algorithm implementation, frontend development, and
server-side generation. The framework uses Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to orchestrate specialized agents handling document parsing,
code planning, and implementation with built-in testing and
documentation generation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WEBFLOW'S CPO BUILT AN AI CHIEF OF STAFF (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Webflow's CPO, Rachel Wolan, developed an AI chief of staff to manage
scheduling, meetings, and give candid feedback. Building her own AI
software helped executives understand AI's potential, promoting
organization-wide adoption through "builder days" and top-down
mandates. Using markdown files for knowledge management and calendar
delegation, her AI optimizes time management and workflow efficiency. 

 WHERE AI IS HEADED IN 2026 (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI in 2026 will see startups advancing enterprise AI adoption, with
specialized, on-prem solutions addressing privacy and efficiency
needs. The landscape will also shift towards capturing decision-making
processes as data moats, and AI security will become crucial as agents
gain operational roles. SaaS incumbents will tighten control over data
access, while AI's rising influence in e-commerce could disrupt
traditional discovery and lead to new monetization models, notably
affecting platforms like Google.

 IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF ERDOS
PROBLEMS THAT WERE SOLVED MORE OR LESS AUTONOMOUSLY BY AN AI TOOL (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI tools are now capable enough to pick off the lowest hanging fruit
among the problems listed as open in the Erdos problem database, but
that category contains problems most likely to have been solved in the
literature. 

 TRACKS VS. TRAINS: WHY THE REAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BOOM HASN'T
