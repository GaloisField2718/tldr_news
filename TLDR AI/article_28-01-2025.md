 FAKE DATA? YOU CAN DO BETTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your application runs on real data, and that's what developers should
use to build it. With advancements in AI-powered anonymization and
synthetic data [4], you can say goodbye to unreliable and unrealistic
mock data — forever.

Neosync [4] (3.7K GitHub stars) integrates with your database or
object storage, anonymizes sensitive data, generates synthetic data
and syncs it across environments. Create safe, high quality data for
local building and testing, fine-tuning models, testing LLMs and more.

The result? Production-like data that developers can safely use
locally. Better testing, faster development, and no risk to security
or privacy.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK SURPASSES CHATGPT AS APP STORE'S TOP APP (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 DeepSeek has become the most downloaded app on the App Store,
reflecting growing user interest in its newly introduced LLM. 

 DEEPSEEK RELEASES OPEN-SOURCE AI IMAGE GENERATOR (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek has released its AI image generator as open source, raising
both excitement in the developer community and concerns about
potential misuse. 

 LINKEDIN CO-FOUNDER RAISES $25 MILLION TO TAKE ON CANCER WITH AI (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reid Hoffman launched Manas AI, a startup using AI to accelerate
cancer drug discovery. The company raised $25 million in seed funding
and partnered with Microsoft. Manas AI focuses on breast cancer,
prostate cancer, and lymphoma and aims to expand to other diseases.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 QWEN 2.5 VL (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The next set of vision language models from Qwen. Qwen2.5-VL is a
versatile visual AI model that excels in multiple areas: recognizing
objects and analyzing visual elements like texts and charts, acting as
an interactive visual agent for tool control, processing lengthy
videos with event detection capabilities, performing precise object
localization through various formats, and generating structured data
outputs for business applications like finance and commerce. 

 CHAIN OF RAG (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reasoning models can now be trained to iteratively do retrieval. This
is similar in spirit to the work shown in the Operator system.
Interestingly, it leads to a substantial improvement, although it's
not clear what the true FLOP controlled gain looks like. 

 BRAINGUARD: PRIVACY-PRESERVING BRAIN DECODING FRAMEWORK (14 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 BrainGuard introduces a collaborative training framework for
reconstructing perceived images from multisubject fMRI data while
safeguarding privacy.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DEEPSEEK JANUS PRO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DeepSeek's image model got a big upgrade today. It is a unified text
and image model - sometimes referred to as any-to-any. This means that
it can both understand and generate images and text interleaved in a
conversation. This is similar to the omni models from OpenAI and the
Gemini suite of models from Google. 

 PIXEL-LEVEL CAPTION GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Pix2Cap-COCO introduces a dataset for panoptic
segmentation-captioning, combining pixel-level annotations and
detailed object-specific captions to advance fine-grained visual and
language understanding. 

 WATERMARKING FRAMEWORK FOR VIDEO GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VideoShield is a watermarking framework specifically designed for
popular diffusion-based video generation models. It embeds watermarks
directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional
training.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IF EVEN 0.001 PERCENT OF AN AI'S TRAINING DATA IS MISINFORMATION, THE
WHOLE THING BECOMES COMPROMISED, SCIENTISTS FIND (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 NYU researchers discovered that poisoning just 0.001% of an LLM's
training data with misinformation can lead to widespread errors,
posing serious risks in medical applications. The study, published in
Nature Medicine, found that even corrupted LLMs perform similarly to
non-corrupted ones on standard benchmarks, making such vulnerabilities
hard to detect. 

 US TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON AI CHIP FLOWS ACROSS THE GLOBE (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The U.S. introduced new AI export controls, capping chip exports to
most countries while exempting 18 allied nations, to maintain AI
leadership and restrict China's access. Major cloud providers like
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon can seek global authorizations under
these rules. Industry players like Nvidia have criticized the
regulations as overreaching. 

 AI MISTAKES ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN HUMAN MISTAKES (7 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 AI systems like LLMs make fundamentally different mistakes from
humans, often erring randomly and with unwarranted confidence. To
address this, we need new security systems and methods to manage AI
errors beyond existing human-error correction techniques. Focus areas
include aligning AI behavior to human-like error patterns and
developing unique mistake mitigation strategies tailored for AI.
