 A SCALABLE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL FOR NETWORKS OF LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agora is a cross-platform, dead-simple protocol for efficient
communication between LLM agents. It enables very different agents to
communicate with each other at a fraction of the cost. Agora can be
easily integrated with existing multiagent frameworks, such as Camel
AI, LangChain, and Swarm. 

 REDUCING HALLUCINATIONS IN VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) addresses
hallucination issues in large vision-language models (LVLMs) where
text responses can stray from visual input due to an over-reliance on
language. 

 A SIMPLE APPROACH TO VISION-LANGUAGE CLASSIFICATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 SuperClass is a straightforward classification model for
vision-language tasks that skips the need for a text encoder, unlike
contrastive models like CLIP. SuperClass avoids complex text filtering
and large batch requirements by directly using tokenized raw text as
classification labels.
