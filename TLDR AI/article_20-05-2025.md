DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 JENSEN HUANG ON GLOBAL AI STRATEGY AND CHIP CONTROLS (28 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, argues that America's chip export
restrictions are “exactly wrong” as they force China to build
competing AI ecosystems while causing American companies to lose
revenue. Specifically, Huang estimated that Nvidia wrote off $5.5
billion in inventory and forfeited $15 billion in Chinese sales. Huang
predicts AI will expand beyond IT into manufacturing and operations,
creating a much larger market where enterprises will pay "$100,000 a
year" for AI workers to address labor shortages. 

 HOW FAR CAN REASONING MODELS SCALE? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's o3 reasoning model has rapidly improved but may soon reach
scaling limits. Current reasoning models like o3 could quickly
converge with overall training compute growth (~4× per year) after
initial rapid scaling. There are concerns about data constraints and
generalizability, but researchers remain optimistic about continued
advancements in reasoning capabilities. 

 MEET CHINA'S FRONTIER AI LABS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 China's AI market is a five-way race. Alibaba dominates open source,
ByteDance leverages multimodal capabilities across its existing
applications (similar to Meta), Shanghai-backed Stepfun excels in

agents, and DeepSeek is research-focused, most known for novel
architecture optimization.
