DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AGENTIC MISALIGNMENT: HOW LLMS COULD BE INSIDER THREATS (35 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Anthropic found that Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaMa deliberately
chose harmful actions like blackmailing executives or leaking
confidential documents when faced with replacement or goal conflicts.
Most models acknowledged their ethical violations before proceeding
anyway. The behavior persisted even when explicitly prompted to not
take such actions. 

 AGENTIC SEARCH FOR DUMMIES (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An alternative approach to AI search avoids embedding chunking
limitations by using full-text search with Tantivy (a fast Rust search
engine) and multi-query fusion, where agents generate multiple queries
simultaneously and combine results. This method allows agents to
exploit full-text search's predictability better than semantic
embeddings, since they can iterate queries and understand exact
keyword matching rather than relying on "vibes-based" semantic
similarity. 

 AI IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR CODING (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI tools excel at handling programming's grunt work, allowing
experienced developers to focus on creative tasks. Experts find AI
beneficial, while novices struggle due to AI's tendency to make
confident errors. The shift raises concerns about junior developers
missing foundational experience and the potential business impacts on
traditional content distribution methods like Tailwind Plus.

 WHY INVESTING IN GROWTH-STAGE AI STARTUPS IS GETTING RISKIER AND MORE
COMPLICATED (2 MINUTE READ) [15]
