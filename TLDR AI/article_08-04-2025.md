HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META RESPONDS TO LLAMA 4 RUMORS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's VP of Generative AI has denied claims that Llama 4 models were
trained on benchmark test sets, pushing back against allegations of
inflated performance scores. 

 AMAZON NOVA REEL 2-MINUTE VIDEOS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The updated Nova Reel model now supports multi-shot videos up to 2
minutes long, offering more creative control and efficiency for
generative video content. 

 INVESTING IN KREA (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Andreessen Horowitz has announced an investment into Krea, a platform
combining AI models to help creatives generate and edit visual

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ONE-MINUTE VIDEO GENERATION WITH TEST-TIME TRAINING (12 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This work introduces Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, featuring
highly expressive hidden states, to overcome the limitations of
standard Transformers and alternatives like Mamba in generating long,
coherent videos. By integrating TTT layers into a pre-trained model,
they demonstrate the generation of coherent one-minute videos from
text storyboards that significantly outperform baseline methods in
telling complex stories according to human evaluations. Tom and Jerry
cartoons are the test bed. 

 SCALING SPEECH LANGUAGE MODELS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study finds that speech-language models initialized from text
models using interleaved training scales more efficiently than
speech-only models. 

 BENCHMARKING WEB AGENT CAPABILITIES (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Online-Mind2Web is a realistic evaluation benchmark for autonomous
web agents. Current models perform worse than expected due to flawed
benchmarks.

 VARGPT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Dual understanding and synthesis model in a single autoregressive
framework. This means that one model can caption and generate images. 

 FLEXTOK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 OpenSource work from Apple. It follows up the company's paper from a
few weeks ago that allows images to be tokenized in a variable number
of tokens. This means that more complex images can use more tokens. 

 ADAPTIVE GRADIENT CLIPPING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ZClip uses EMA-based gradient norm statistics to adaptively suppress
outlier gradients, preventing loss spikes and improving training
stability without static thresholds.
