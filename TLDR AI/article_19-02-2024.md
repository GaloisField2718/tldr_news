HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC TAKES STEPS TO PREVENT ELECTION MISINFORMATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Anthropic is testing Prompt Shield, a technology designed to redirect
U.S. users of its chatbot Claude seeking political and voting
information to authoritative sources like TurboVote. 

 OPENAI'S NEXT AI PRODUCT COULD BE AFTER YOUR JOB (AGAIN) (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 OpenAI has been reportedly developing two types of AI agent software
for over a year. The first type can be used to automate complex tasks
by taking over a customer's device. The second AI agent class handles
web-based tasks and can gather public data. It is unclear when the
company plans to release these agents. 

 GEMINI 1.5 PRO (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google released a new MoE model that matches Gemini 1.0 Ultra in
performance but scales up to 1m tokens in context while using less
compute due to its smaller size. It is natively multimodal.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LONG IS MORE FOR ALIGNMENT (28 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It is often challenging to know which examples should be used when
aligning language models using preference data. This work suggests a
surprisingly robust baseline - choose the 1,000 longest examples. 

 EXTREME VIDEO COMPRESSION WITH PRE-TRAINED DIFFUSION MODELS (18
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Diffusion models can be repurposed for their broad ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô of
the world as they get better at synthesizing images and videos. This
paper found a phenomenal 0.02 bits per pixel compression. The key
trick here was to measure perceptual similarity along the way and
resend an original video frame as needed. 

 IMPROVING MATH SKILLS IN LLMS (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers have created OpenMathInstruct-1, a new dataset for
training open-source Large Language Models in math, matching the
performance of closed-source models. This breakthrough, featuring 1.8
million problem-solution pairs, opens the door for more accessible and
competitive math instruction AI tools. 

üßë‚Äçüíª 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MINBPE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Andrej Karpathy released a minimal, clean, and extensible
implementation of the byte pair encoding used in language model
tokenizers. 

 GPTSCRIPT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 GPTScript is a new scripting language that automates interactions
with OpenAI large language models. The project's ultimate goal is to
create a fully natural language-based programming experience. 

 QWEN 1.8B AND 72B LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 These models, which look similar to Llama 2, are trained on 3T tokens
and excel at a number of tasks. The Qwen team has released chat
versions and quants. Excitingly, the models seem to excel at
reasoning, math, and code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SORA REFERENCE PAPERS (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [16] 

 A list of 30 papers that relate to the newly released Sora video
model. 

 THE DATA REVOLUTION IN VENTURE CAPITAL (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Over 75% of public market trades (AUM of $1T+) are now driven by
data-driven algorithms, a revolution initiated by hedge funds in the
90s. Today, that data-driven approach is rapidly infiltrating venture
capital, with projections indicating that over 75% of VC deal reviews
will involve AI and data analytics by 2025, transforming how
investments are sourced, evaluated, and managed. 

 COMMUNITY, COLLABORATION, CREATIVITY IN THE AGE OF AI (11 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 How we talk to each other, collaborate, and undertake creative tasks
has meaningfully shifted since we introduced software. We‚Äôre
starting to see the beginnings of another meaningful shift with AI.
How substantial this shift will be is being underestimated. Startups
born with AI integration in their products from day one will have a
huge advantage over existing companies adding it on top of their
existing products.
