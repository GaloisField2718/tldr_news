HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 US AIR FORCE CONFIRMS FIRST SUCCESSFUL AI DOGFIGHT (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 DARPA's AI-controlled jet successfully engaged a human pilot in a
dogfight, showcasing progress in autonomous aviation within the Air
Force's ACE program. Tests will continue through 2024 amid discussions
on military applications of AI for defense and drone enhancement. 

 INTEL COMPLETES ASSEMBLY OF FIRST COMMERCIAL HIGH-NA EUV CHIPMAKING
TOOL ‚Äî ADDRESSES COST CONCERNS, PREPS FOR 14A PROCESS DEVELOPMENT IN
2025 (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Intel Foundry has completed assembly of the first commercial High-NA
EUV lithography machine, an advancement critical for its 14A process
node R&D targeted for 2025. The High-NA tool, by ASML, enables smaller
feature printing and up to 2.9X transistor density improvement.
Intel's early adoption of this technology aims to overcome past delays
and regain leadership in semiconductor process technology. 

 ADOBE PREVIEWS AI INNOVATIONS TO ADVANCE PROFESSIONAL VIDEO WORKFLOWS
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Adobe is integrating generative AI video tools into Premiere Pro,
including new capabilities for shot extension, object
addition/removal, and text-to-video features, streamlined by its
Firefly video model. The updates, including a technology preview and
general availability of AI-powered audio workflows, aim to enhance
video production efficiency and creativity.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BYTEDANCE'S DECOUPLEQ FOR MODEL COMPRESSION (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DecoupleQ is a quantization approach that significantly enhances the
accuracy of large models at ultra-low bit levels. This method
restructures the quantization process by splitting model parameters
into integer and floating-point parts that are then optimized using
traditional methods. 

 MOVA: A NEW MULTIMODAL LANGUAGE MODELS (28 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MoVA is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that improves image
content understanding by selectively integrating different vision
encoders. It addresses the limitations of current encoders like CLIP
by using a context-aware expert routing strategy and a
mixture-of-vision-expert adapter to dynamically fuse expertise from
various sources. 

 LIDAR-BASED MOVING OBJECT SEGMENTATION (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers have developed MambaMOS, a new approach for segmenting
moving objects in LiDAR point clouds.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ENHANCED IMAGE HARMONIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TF-GPH is a new method for Painterly Image Harmonization called that
bypasses the need for training data or prompts by using an innovative
"share-attention module". 

 CREDIT RISK PREDICTION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 FinLangNet is a model designed to enhance risk prediction in the
financial sector. By adopting natural language processing techniques,
FinLangNet uniquely models credit loan trajectories akin to linguistic
structures. 

 A PLATFORM FOR MULTI-AGENT EXPLORATION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The newly introduced MAexp platform supports multi-agent exploration
by offering a high-efficiency, flexible environment that supports a
wide array of scenarios and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
algorithms.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INTRODUCTION TO TRITON (71 MINUTE VIDEO) [15] 

 Triton is a high level language for writing low level CUDA kernels.
It allows you to write in a Python style form and dramatically
accelerate your AI model performance. 

 BUILDING RELIABLE SYSTEMS OUT OF UNRELIABLE AGENTS (17 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 AI agents might not be inherently reliable, but they can be harnessed
to build reliable systems. Strategies include starting with simple
prompts and creating an evaluation system for iterative improvement,
deploying with observability, leveraging Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), considering model fine-tuning, and using
complementary agents to cover each other's weaknesses and improve the
system's overall reliability. 

 FOUNDATION CAPITAL SEES AI LEADING $4.6T OPPORTUNITY IN
SERVICE-AS-SOFTWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Many VCs are talking about AI taking a bite out of the services
business. Foundation Capital believes there is $4.6 trillion worth of
work to be automated, thanks to AI: both for in-house functions and
outsourced services. We're entering the era of Service-as-Software.
