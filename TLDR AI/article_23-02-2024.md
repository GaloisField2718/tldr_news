HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABLE DIFFUSION 3 (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stability AI has announced Stable Diffusion 3, a Diffusion
Transformer similar to Sora from OpenAI. The company trained a suite
of models ranging from 800m to 8B parameters, a substantial leap in
size from previous image generation models. The models will be
released after a period of research. 

 HOW BRET TAYLOR‚ÄôS NEW COMPANY IS RETHINKING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN
THE AGE OF AI (4 MINUTE READ) [10]

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PHIND 70B CODE MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Phind's 70B code model scores 83% on HumanEval, matching GPT-4
performance. Crucially it has significantly fewer lazy responses and
refusals. The 34B model will be released soon - the larger 70B model
will be released in time. 

 DETECT UNSAFE PROMPTS IN LANGUAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 GradSafe is a new method for detecting unsafe prompts in large
language models without extensive training. It can identify unsafe
prompts more effectively than current methods by analyzing the
gradients of specific parameters. 

 SCENE TEXT RECOGNITION (48 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Class-Aware Mask-guided (CAM) feature refinement is a new method that
enhances text recognition in complex scenes.

 LIGHTWEIGHTS CPP GEMMA INFERENCE ENGINE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 This codebase allows for inference on SIMD CPU architectures, similar
to llama.cpp. It was developed by Google engineers and scientists. The
tool's purpose is to encourage experimentation and usage of the Gemma
models released yesterday. 

 MULTILINGUAL MEDICAL LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 MMedLM 2 is a groundbreaking multilingual language model tailored for
the medical field. It is trained on a new 25.5 billion-token corpus
that covers six languages. MMedLM 2 outperforms other models,
including GPT-4, in medical question-answering tasks. 

 OBJECT RECOGNITION AS NEXT TOKEN PREDICTION (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 A new method for object recognition using a language decoder. The
method involves predicting text tokens from image embeddings and
utilizing a specialized non-causal attention mask. It enables
efficient parallel sampling of multiple labels.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOZILLA‚ÄôS ROLE AS AN EVALUATOR IN THE NEURIPS EFFICIENCY CHALLENGE
(6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Mozilla acted as a scalable evaluator for the efficiency challenge
hosted last year. It ensured that entrants complied with the rules of
the competition and evaluated model performance. This post is a good
introduction to language model evaluation and competitive training
recipes. 

 FUNSEARCH: MAKING NEW DISCOVERIES IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES USING
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 FunSearch, introduced in a recent Nature paper, is a method that uses
large language models to make new discoveries in mathematics and
computer science. It pairs a creative LLM with an evaluator to produce
verifiable solutions, demonstrating success with the tough cap set and
bin-packing problems. The approach yields human-interpretable
solutions, marking a significant step in AI-driven scientific
discovery.
