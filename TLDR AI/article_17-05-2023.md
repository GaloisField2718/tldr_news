HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

ANTHROPIC X ZOOM (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anthropic.com/index/zoom-partnership-and-investment?utm_source=tldrai]


Zoom will invest in Anthropic and use Claude in a number of internal
and external AI product offerings. The details of the deal aren't
disclosed. 

SAM ALTMAN TESTIFIES BEFORE CONGRESS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/16/tech/sam-altman-openai-congress/index.html?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI CEO Sam Altman urged lawmakers to regulate artificial
intelligence during a Senate panel hearing Tuesday, describing the
technology‚Äôs current boom as a potential ‚Äúprinting press moment‚Äù
but one that required safeguards.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

TINY STORIES, 1 TRANSFORMER BLOCK CAN GENERATE STORIES (25 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759?utm_source=tldrai] 

With models getting larger and more expensive we generally get better
performance. But what happens if we go the other way? It turns out
that tiny models can learn to generate coherent, novel, and
grammatically correct stories. If you carefully construct the training
data set and restrict the vocabulary to common words, you get some
compelling completions from these miniscule models. 

IMPROVING ACTION RECOGNITION: EXPLORING MULTIMODAL GENERALIZATION (9
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07214?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study introduces a new concept in egocentric action recognition
called Multimodal Generalization (MMG), which focuses on how systems
can adapt when data from certain sources is limited or missing. To
investigate this, a new dataset called MMG-Ego4D was created, and new
methods were developed to enhance the system's ability to generalize,
potentially guiding future research in this area. 

SUPERICL: MAKING BIG AI MODELS WORK BETTER WITH SMALLER ONES (6 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08848?utm_source=tldrai] 

SuperICL is a new technique that helps massive AI models, like GPT-3
and GPT-4, to learn better by working with smaller, locally fine-tuned
models. This approach not only boosts the performance of these big AI
models on tasks, but also improves their stability and the abilities
of smaller models, such as understanding different languages and
explaining their decisions.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

REACT HOOK TO RUN LLM IN THE BROWSER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/r2d4/react-llm?utm_source=tldrai] 

With the advent of WebGPU, you can now run hardware accelerated
workflows in the browser. This repository exposes a React hook that
downloads the model from the HuggingFace CDN, compiles to WASM, and
runs inference. 

GUIDANCE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/microsoft/guidance?utm_source=tldrai] 

Guidance enables you to control modern language models more
effectively and efficiently than traditional prompting or chaining. 

DIFY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/langgenius/dify?utm_source=tldrai] 

One API for plugins and datasets and one interface for prompt
engineering and visual operation, all for creating powerful AI
applications.

MISCELLANEOUS

THE FIRST RNN ON THE TRANSFORMERS LIBRARY (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/rwkv?utm_source=tldrai] 

The RWKV model is a linear attention model with built in recurrence.
It is a powerful language model that runs fast with a theoretically
long context window. The model development has an active discord
community which now is more visible on the HuggingFace platform. 

THE MOBILE AI RACE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/qo2Ww?utm_source=tldrai] 

Tech companies are racing to add AI to their mobile devices, however,
high computing costs present a significant hurdle. 

METAPHOR SYSTEMS LANGCHAIN INTEGRATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/metaphor_search.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Metaphor systems is pretty much the only internet scale neural search
engine (powered purely by language models). This integration allows
you to use that system as a retrieval backend for models in langchain.
