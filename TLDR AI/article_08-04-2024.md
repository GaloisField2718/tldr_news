 HIGGSFIELD: CREATE PERSONALIZED AND VISUALLY-STUNNING VIDEOS IN ANY
STYLE FROM SIMPLE TEXT PROMPTS AND 1 SELFIE (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Higgsfield‚Äôs new foundational model and app [3] change the game for
video AI ‚Äî allowing any creator to instantly bring their vision to
life with unparalleled control:
‚û°Ô∏è Starting from just 1 selfie [4], create highly personalized and
realistic human characters that can be dropped into almost any scene.

‚û°Ô∏è Keep full creative control [3]: use text to video to create
original scenes or upload your selfie and a reference video to get
exactly what you need. It‚Äôs all powered by Higgsfield‚Äôs
proprietary video model.

‚û°Ô∏è Mobile focused: Higgsfield is mobile-first [3] ‚Äî so anyone
can create content whenever and wherever they‚Äôre inspired.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMD TO OPEN SOURCE MES FIRMWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AMD has agreed to open source the firmware for its Radeon GPUs. This
means the community can quickly improve AI frameworks and potentially
AMD adoption. 

 XAI LOOKING TO RAISE $3B (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk's xAI is in talks with investors to raise $3B in a funding
round that would value the artificial intelligence startup at $18B. 

 INTRODUCING COMMAND R+: A SCALABLE LLM BUILT FOR BUSINESS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Cohere has introduced Command R+, a powerful, scalable LLM designed
for enterprise use cases, featuring advanced retrieval augmented
generation with citation, multilingual coverage in 10 key languages,
and tool use capabilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 QWEN1.5-32B (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Qwen team has trained and released a 32B parameter model that
achieves strong performance. It can be fit in more modest memory
systems. 

 PROTECTING IMAGES FROM UNAUTHORIZED SEGMENTATION (20 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 "Anything Unsegmentable" is a new approach designed to shield digital
images from being segmented by powerful AI models, addressing
potential copyright and privacy issues. 

 A BENCHMARK FOR DETECTING LLM ERRORS (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers have launched ReaLMistake, a benchmark aimed at
systematically detecting errors in large language model responses.

 üêã¬†ORCA ADDS AI SECURITY TO CLOUD SECURITY PLATFORM (SPONSOR) [12]


 Orca is leading the way in AI security with the addition of AI
Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) [12] to its cloud security
platform. Orca‚Äôs AI-SPM detects risks in models and data across all
major LLMs and 50+ commonly used AI packages. This complements Orca's
GenAI-powered security features [13] - natural language search,
automated remediation, IAM optimization, and anomaly detection. Read
more >> [12] 

 SWE-AGENT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SWE-agent turns LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) into software engineering agents
that can fix bugs and issues in real GitHub repositories. SWE-agent
sets the state-of-the-art performance on the full SWE-bench benchmark,
resolving 12.29% of issues. 

 SCHEDULE FREE OPTIMIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Researchers from Meta have been teasing a new optimizer on X. They
have now released the code along with various integrations. The
optimizer has no LR schedule, which means you don‚Äôt need to know the
full number of training steps beforehand. It has been shown
empirically to work on a wide variety of problems including language
models. 

 REPRESENTATION FINE-TUNING (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 ReFT is a new parameter-efficient method for fine-tuning language
models. It is substantially cheaper than even PeFT while achieving
strong performance.

 FOUR TAKEAWAYS ON THE RACE TO AMASS DATA FOR AI (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The development of artificial intelligence heavily relies on vast
amounts of data, which is being rapidly consumed by tech companies
faster than it is being produced, leading to predictions that
high-quality digital data may be exhausted by 2026. In response,
companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta are exploring new methods to
obtain more data, including using YouTube video transcripts, revising
privacy policies, considering the purchase of major publishers, and
investigating the use of "synthetic" data generated by AI models,
despite the risk of compounding errors. 

 SPEED TESTS FOR LLAMA 2, STABLE DIFFUSION (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 MLPerf has updated its inferencing benchmarks to include large
language models like Llama 2 70B and Stable Diffusion XL, reflecting
the industry's shift to massive generative AI. In the latest tests,
Nvidia's systems, particularly those equipped with the H200 processor,
outperformed competitors from Intel and Qualcomm in both speed and
efficiency. The benchmarks highlight the importance of high-bandwidth
memory in handling large AI models, with Intel's Gaudi 2 and
Qualcomm's Cloud AI 100 Ultra also showcasing significant performances
in the generative AI space. 

 RABBIT PARTNERS WITH ELEVENLABS TO POWER VOICE COMMANDS ON ITS DEVICE
(2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Rabbit partners with ElevenLabs to incorporate voice command
technology into its upcoming r1 devices, enhancing human-device
interaction with low latency models for a more natural experience. The
first batch of r1 devices, which feature functionalities like chatbot
interaction and bi-directional translation, is set to ship by March
31. ElevenLabs has recently raised $80 million, despite facing
challenges with misuse of its voice cloning technology.
