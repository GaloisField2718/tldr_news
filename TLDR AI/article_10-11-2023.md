HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SAMSUNG TEASES AI TRANSLATE LIVE FEATURE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Samsung has mostly been quiet in the AI race, but it recently showed
off a live AI translation feature for phone calls. The feature is
expected to launch in 2024. 

 ADEPT EXPERIMENTS DEMOS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adept is building a useful agent system for enterprises. It is now
opening up small mini demos for people to interact with like
delegating knowledge working tasks, using new tools, or working with
unstructured data. 

 INTRODUCING GPTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI introduces customizable ChatGPT (GPTs), enabling users to
tailor the AI for specific tasks without coding. The GPT Store,
launching soon, will allow the sharing and monetizing of these custom
GPTs, with a focus on privacy, safety, and expanding utility in the
real world. Enterprises can deploy internal-only GPTs, enhancing
business operations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LARGEST DISTRIBUTED LLM TRAINING JOB ON 50K+ CHIPS (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Google ran a MaxText + Jax training job on an unbelievable amount of
chips concurrently while maintaining 66+ utilization, creating a
strong contender for the best possible MFU. The project was mostly
built on proprietary technology, but it showcases some interesting
tidbits for other large-scale distributed computing groups. 

 INTEL PERFORMANCE PER DOLLAR VS. H100 (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MLPerf is a standard machine learning performance benchmark that
accurately shows how platforms and models perform in real-world
settings. MLPerf Training v3.1 just landed and it showcases amazing
H100 performance in absolute terms, but when comparing wall clock
performance per dollar spent, Intel still holds its own. 

 BETTER DATA IMPROVES LLMS TRAINING (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This study introduces a better way to clean up the data used to train
LLMs, ensuring they are tested fairly and work more reliably.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE WITH ZERO FLAKES (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 QA Wolf [11] gets web apps to 80% automated test coverage in just 4
months. And working with them is more cost-effective than growing your
QA team.
After giving QA Wolf a product tour and access to an environment,
their QA engineers will build you a comprehensive end-to-end test
suite in Playwright. There's no vendor lock-in [11] and it's easy to
export your tests. QA Wolf also provides 24-hour maintenance and
triage. You receive human-verified bug reports [11] ‚Äî no false
positives. Plus, you get unlimited parallel test runs on their infra
at no additional cost. Schedule a demo [11] to learn more.

 DOUBLING THE CONTEXT OF LLMS WITH EFFICIENT CONTEXT EXTENSION (GITHUB
REPO) [12] 

 LongQLoRA is a new tool that lets LLMs understand longer sequences. 

 LIDAR-ENHANCED ROAD SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Researchers developed a smarter method for self-driving cars to
recognize roads by using lidar technology, which requires less manual
work but still keeps the system accurate. 

 USING TEXT-BASED AI MODELS FOR VISUAL TASKS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Researchers discovered that large language models can be powerful
tools for visual tasks even though they were designed for text. The
researchers achieved improved results in various visual tasks by using
parts of these text-trained models to process images and videos
directly.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NVIDIA ENVY: UNDERSTANDING THE GPU GOLD RUSH (24 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia became the AI kingmaker in 2023. Thousands of companies and
countries begged to purchase its GPUs. Will the insatiable demand
persist? This piece explores the Nvidia run-up, the resulting
shortage, and the future of GPU demand. 

 OPENAI DATA PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI wants to build partnerships for open and private dataset
creation for AI training. This could signal it is running out of
tokens for its next model training runs. 

 AI IS ABOUT TO COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW YOU USE COMPUTERS (12 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Current software is still limited in its ability to understand and
assist with diverse tasks. Bill Gates predicts that AI agents will
revolutionize software interaction, offering personalized assistance
across various tasks without needing specific apps, marking the
biggest shift in computing since the move from command-line to
graphical interfaces.
