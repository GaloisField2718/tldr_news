 HACKERS STOLE MILLIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. DATA BROKERS SELL
THEM LEGALLY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Criminal hacker group USDoD has allegedly leaked 2.7BN records of
personal information ‚Äî including names, addresses, dates of birth,
Social Security numbers, and phone numbers.

At the same time, legal data brokers are selling the same personal
data [4] (including SSNs!) to every spammer and scammer under the sun.

Hackers aren't your problem to solve. But you can do something about
those brazen data brokers, and that's sign up to Incogni today [4].
They'll send dozens of removal requests, deleting your personal data
[4] from the data brokers you know‚Äîand the ones you don't.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FASHION DATASET FOR PERSONALIZATION (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This dataset, generated using large language models, tailors outfits
to different occasions, styles, and body types, offering high-quality
and relevant suggestions. 

 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers are enhancing 3D scene reconstruction methods like Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) by introducing
uncertainty estimation techniques. These methods, while delivering
high-quality renders, struggle with handling uncertainties from noise,
occlusions, and camera inaccuracies. 

 EXTENDING LLMS' CONTEXT LIMIT (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new
approach designed to extend the context limit of large language models
without requiring additional training.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 IS THE FUTURE OF DATA TEAMS CENTRALIZED, DECENTRALIZED, OR HYBRID?
ANALYTICS LEADERS WEIGH IN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 For data teams to continue delivering value, they need to evolve with
the time. This panel discussion [10] featuring leaders from AtScale,
Bayer, and Evoke will offer fresh outlooks on how to modernize the
data team: operating models, data maturity assessments, DataOps,
semantic layers, ethical considerations, and more. Tune in live on
September 25. [10] 

 LLAMA OMNI (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Llama Omni is a full speech in-out model based on Llama 3.1 8B that
can run at extremely low latency and still deliver high quality
responses. 

 AWS AI STACK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A ready-to-use, full-stack boilerplate project for building
serverless AI applications on AWS. It is a great fit for those seeking
a trusted AWS foundation for AI apps and access to powerful LLM models
via Bedrock that keeps your app's data separate from model providers. 

 INTERNET OF AGENTS FOR MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Internet of Agents (IoA) is a new framework designed to improve
multi-agent collaboration by integrating diverse third-party agents
more effectively.

 BOOSTING MODELS WITH DIVERSE GENERATIVE DATA (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 DiverGen is a new strategy for creating generative datasets to
improve instance segmentation models. Unlike costly manual
annotations, it uses generative models to produce diverse data,
addressing overfitting and enhancing model performance. 

 ELON MUSK SAYS TESLA HAS ‚ÄòNO NEED' TO LICENSE XAI MODELS (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Elon Musk has denied reports that Tesla will share revenue with his
AI startup xAI to use its AI models. He clarified that Tesla has
benefited from xAI engineers but doesn't need to license xAI's models.
Musk emphasized that xAI's large models cannot run on Tesla's vehicle
computers. 

 APPLE IS THINKING ABOUT A RIVAL TO META RAY-BAN GLASSES (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Apple may develop non-AR smart glasses, potentially competing with
Meta's $299 Ray-Ban glasses, which don't have AR capabilities. Meta's
glasses include features like a camera and an AI chatbot. With less
complexity, Apple's non-AR glasses could be cheaper, lighter, and
offer better battery life.
