 OPENAI GENERATES MORE TURMOIL (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's founding team is experiencing significant turnover, with

co-founders Greg Brockman (on sabbatical) and Ilya Sutskever (who has
left), amid speculation of burnout and lucrative secondary financial
rewards. The organization faces challenges as it may require a new
major cash partner and anticipates delays in the release of GPT-5,

models.
