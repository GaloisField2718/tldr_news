 VOICE AI FEELS HUMAN NOW… AND THIS COMPANY HAS MADE OVER 200
MILLION CALLS TO PROVE IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every time we demo Regal's AI Agent platform [4], it blows people's
minds how human it feels. And in production, Voice AI performs like
humans—including taking actions like updating a CRM, processing
payments, and transferring calls as needed.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI INTRODUCES NEW TOOLS FOR AI AGENTS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has launched new APIs and an Agents SDK to help developers
build AI agents more easily. The toolkit includes web and file search,
computer use capabilities, and observability tools to streamline agent
orchestration and task automation. 

 REKA'S NEW REASONING MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reka has open-sourced Reka Flash 3, a 21B parameter general-purpose
model optimized for reasoning, chat, coding, and instruction
following. It performs competitively with proprietary models and
features a 32k context length, making it suitable for low-latency and
on-device applications. 

 HUGGING FACE EXPANDING LEROBOT PLATFORM (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hugging Face and Yaak have released L2D, the largest open-source
multimodal dataset for automotive AI. It includes expert and student
driving policies collected from driving schools, with natural language
instructions to enhance spatial intelligence models. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MOVIEAGENT: LONG CONSISTENT MOVIE GENERATION (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This system strings together multiple generative modalities and uses
persona-based prompting to encourage consistency and accurate results.
It then uses the Stable Diffusion video model to create and stitch
frames together. This likely would be improved using Wan. 

 LARGE LANGUAGE AND VISION EMBEDDING MODELS WITH HARDNESS-WEIGHTED
CONTRASTIVE LEARNING (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Building embedding models for vision and language tasks using a
contrastive loss can often lead these models to struggle on hard
negative pairs. This work proposes a regularization strategy and
observed a substantial improvement in difficult retrieval problems.
The method also scales to zero shot video retrieval. 

 GENERALIZED DISCRETE DIFFUSION (24 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This work extends diffusion on discrete data, such as text, with a
generalized denoising process and a slightly improved masking scheme.
This combination makes training efficient and gives the model the
ability to correct its own output. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MAKE AI WORK PRECISELY FOR YOU (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Generic AI is a blunt tool. Nebius AI Studio [13] just launched
fine-tuning, letting you customize leading AI models for your specific
needs:

 	* Customize 30+ SOTA models
 	* Scale seamlessly from serverless via AI studio to reserved cloud -
all within the Nebius ecosystem
 	* Open AI SDK compatible
 	* Crafted to be among the fastest and most cost-effective solutions
in the market.

 YOLOE: REAL-TIME OPEN VOCABULARY DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Small vision models that can be prompted in a number of ways for open
vocabulary detection. This means you can use classes, images, and text
as means to determine what the model should detect. Importantly, it
also runs at 300fps, enabling real-time applications. 

 PERCEPTION EFFICIENT RECONSTRUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Another method that combined textual query capabilities with 3d
reconstruction from images. This particular system uses a feed forward
model for rapid reconstruction. 

 DEEPMIND'S IMAGE-TEXT MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 DeepMind has introduced TIPS, a novel image-text model designed for
dense and global vision tasks. By combining contrastive learning with
masked image modeling and using synthetic captions, it achieves strong
spatial awareness and outperforms existing approaches in multiple
benchmarks.

 AI MARKET SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The AI industry is evolving rapidly, with OpenAI's GPT-4.5 focusing
on refinement, Google's Gemini 2.0 facing adoption hurdles, and
China's DeepSeek and Kimi pushing the limits of affordable,
specialized AI. Meta is expanding AI into wearables and robotics,
while XAI's Grok 3 remains a niche competitor. The AI race is
intensifying as specialization and real-world integration become
critical, challenging established players like OpenAI and Google. 

 THE TECHCRUNCH AI GLOSSARY (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article provides definitions for key AI terminology, including
"AI agents," chain-of-thought reasoning, deep learning, and large
language models (LLMs). Deep learning is described as a subset of
machine learning inspired by the neural pathways in the human brain,
and LLMs are described as neural networks enabling AI assistants like
ChatGPT. Fine-tuning and the importance of weights in optimizing AI
models are also discussed. 

 LOPSIDED AI REVENUES (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 NVIDIA's data center business leads the AI market with Q4 revenues of
$31 billion and over 70% margins. Microsoft and IBM follow with $3.25
billion and $2 billion in AI revenues, respectively. Hardware still
dominates over software and services in the AI sector.
