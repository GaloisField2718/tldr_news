HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ALPHAGENOME: AI FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE GENOME (10 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 AlphaGenome, an AI tool by DeepMind, enhances the prediction of
variant effects in human DNA sequences, improving our understanding of
genome function and regulation. It processes up to 1 million DNA
letters and predicts diverse molecular properties, offering
unparalleled precision and comprehensive insights into genetic
variants. Available as a preview API, AlphaGenome aims to advance
disease research, synthetic biology, and fundamental genomics. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES AI-POWERED ARTIFACTS PLATFORM WITH APP SHARING (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude users can now build, host, and share web apps created by
Claude in a dedicated “Artifacts” space. Artifacts can now make
calls to the Anthropic API as well. 

 GOOGLE RELEASES OPEN-SOURCE GEMINI CLI TERMINAL AGENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google joins OpenAI and Anthropic with a coding CLI tool, offering 60
requests per minute and 1,000 daily requests at no charge. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STATE OF FOUNDATION MODELS 2025 (60 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VC analysis reveals 1 in 8 workers globally now use AI monthly, and
frontier model training costs hitting $500M although most frontier
models are surpassed within 3 weeks. The report documents
unprecedented revenue growth (some startups scaling $0-$20M in 60
days), reasoning models emerging as the new scaling frontier, and
predicts AGI within 3 years. 

 DON'T BUILD MULTI-AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The makers of Devin challenge popular frameworks like OpenAI's Swarm
by arguing that parallel subagents create fragile systems due to
context-sharing failures and conflicting decision-making. Their
approach prioritizes single-threaded agents with full context traces,
backed by real-world examples from Claude Code and internal Devin
architecture decisions. 

 HOW FAR CAN REASONING MODELS SCALE? (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's reasoning models like o3 have rapidly improved, but further
scaling of its techniques might be limited. Reasoning training, which
significantly enhances models post-pre-training, currently uses less
compute than the largest training runs, suggesting room for growth.
However, challenges like data constraints and the importance of
innovations beyond just compute scaling could impact future progress.

MISCELLANEOUS

 META POACHES THREE OPENAI RESEARCHERS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Meta has poached three OpenAI researchers to join its
superintelligence efforts. Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, and
Xiaohua Zhai were all working in OpenAI's Zurich office and they
worked together at Google DeepMind before that. Meta has been on an
intense recruiting drive headed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company
plans to spend up to $65 billion on capital expenditures this year
largely to build out its AI ambitions. 

 PETE BUTTIGIEG WARNS AMERICA IS "DANGEROUSLY UNDERPREPARED" FOR AI (4
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 In a Substack post, the potential 2028 presidential candidate argues
that AI will reshape work, wealth, and citizenship faster than a high
school student can graduate—yet neither Trump nor Democrats have
articulated clear AI policies. AI will likely be the #1 challenge for
world leaders. 

 ALTMAN POSTS PRIVATE EMAILS IN "IO" TRADEMARK DISPUTE WITH IYO (3
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Altman shared email exchanges showing iyO founder Jason Rugolo
pitching for investment, which Altman declined, claiming he was
working on a "competitive" device. Rugolo claims he was played after
sharing technology details of his device to entice investment.
