MICROSOFT UNVEILS NEXT-GENERATION AI COPILOT FOR WORK IN MICROSOFT 365
(7 MINUTE READ)
[https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/?utm_source=tldrai]


Microsoft has launched a new AI-powered tool called Copilot for Work
in Microsoft 365, aimed at helping users become more productive,
creative and skilled in their work. It integrates large language
models with user data in Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 apps,
allowing users to create, analyze, express, collaborate and achieve
more. 

STRIPE AND OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-and-openai?utm_source=tldrai]


Stripe and OpenAI collaborate to monetize OpenAI‚Äôs flagship products
and enhance Stripe with GPT-4. ‚ÄúWe're excited to work with Stripe to
monetize our flagship products,‚Äù said Peter Welinder, vice president
of product and partnerships at OpenAI. ‚ÄúBeyond payments, Stripe is
helping us with everything from recurring billing and tax compliance
to automating our financial operations.‚Äù 

PWC USING GENERATIVE AI FOR LEGAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html?utm_source=tldrai]


PwC announced a global partnership with AI startup Harvey, providing
PwC‚Äôs Legal Business Solutions professionals exclusive access (among
the Big 4) to the AI platform. Harvey, which is backed by the OpenAI
Startup Fund, is a platform that uses machine learning to automate and
enhance legal work. Harvey will help generate insights and
recommendations based on large volumes of data, delivering richer
information that will enable PwC professionals to identify solutions
faster. All outputs will be overseen and reviewed by PwC
professionals.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

S4 TAKES ON RL (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03982?utm_source=tldrai] 

S4 models are a great new long range architecture. This work modifies
them so they can initialize and update their internal state in
parallel and then explores the modifications on a meta learning task.
They found some promising results that point to S4 and other state
space models potentially being used as the default RL architecture
over LSTMS. 

INVESTIGATING GANSFORMER: A VARIATION OF GANS FOR IMAGE GENERATION (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08577?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses the authors' reproduction and evaluation of the
GANformer, a variation of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
used for image generation. They successfully recreated both variations
of the model and found differences between their results and those of
the authors, as well as two undisclosed variations of the presented
procedures. 

RE-REND: REAL-TIME RENDERING OF NERFS ACROSS DEVICES (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08717?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper proposes Re-ReND, a method designed to achieve real-time
performance of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rendering on
resource-constrained devices by converting the NeRF into a
representation that can be efficiently processed by standard graphics
pipelines, distilling the NeRF by extracting the learned density into
a mesh, and factorizing the learned color information into a set of
matrices that represent the scene‚Äôs light field.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

NANOT5 (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/PiotrNawrot/nanoT5?utm_source=tldrai] 

The repository contains code for reproducing a pre-trained T5 language
model with limited resources in PyTorch. The model is pre-trained on
the C4 dataset and fine-tuned on Super-Natural Instructions (SNI).
Despite using only one GPU and limited resources, the model achieves
~40 RougeL on the SNI test set, compared to ~42 RougeL of the original
HuggingFace model. The contribution is a user-friendly template for
NLP research. 

LLAMA SUPPORT IN HUGGINGFACE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955?utm_source=tldrai]


The popular open model by Meta, whose weights were leaked earlier this
month is now included in the popular Transformers library. It is only
on the main branch, but you can now use this to train Stanford's
Alpaca using their training code. 

BIFORMER: VISION TRANSFORMER WITH BI-LEVEL ROUTING ATTENTION (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/rayleizhu/BiFormer?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses the use of attention as a powerful tool for
capturing long-range dependencies in vision transformers but
highlights the challenge of its high computational burden and memory
footprint. To address this issue, the authors propose a dynamic sparse
attention via bi-level routing that allows for flexible allocation of
computations with content awareness. The proposed BiFormer model,
which utilizes the bi-level routing attention, shows good performance
and high computational efficiency across various computer vision
tasks.

MOZILLA RESPONSIBLE AI CHALLENGE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.axios.com/2023/03/15/mozilla-responsible-ai-challenge?utm_source=tldrai]


Mozilla has launched a "Responsible AI" challenge, offering
entrepreneurs the chance to create trustworthy AI applications. The
challenge is part of Mozilla's existing Builders programme, and aims
to establish the future with AI by encouraging the creation of
applications framed by the right principles, such as inclusivity and
the avoidance of bias and toxic content. The winners of the challenge,
which opens on March 30, are eligible for $50,000 in prizes and a
$25,000 top prize, as well as mentorship and resources. The
competition takes place amidst a rush by tech giants to incorporate
generative AI into their processes and products. 

CHALLENGE: READ ANCIENT SCROLLS WITH ML (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://scrollprize.org/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Vesuvius Challenge aims to read an unopened Herculaneum scroll for
the first time and is offering $250,000 in prizes, including a
$150,000 Grand Prize and $100,000 in Progress Prizes. Contestants
receive 3D X-ray scans, papyrus fragments, tutorials, and tools to
virtually unwrap the scrolls. They also have access to a Discord
server to connect with other contestants and the Vesuvius Challenge
team. The competition is open, and the organizers believe that it will
help achieve the goal by 2023.
