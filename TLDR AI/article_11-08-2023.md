The semantic layer is key to delivering the ‚Äòlast mile‚Äô of
analytics ‚Äî making data available in tools such as Power BI,
Tableau, and Excel. But implementing it in the data-intensive
insurance industry can get tricky.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

STANFORD AGENTS CODE OPEN SOURCED! (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents?utm_source=tldrai]

A research group at Stanford created a splash a few months ago with
their fully simulated village with realistic people living lives. That
code is now open sourced. The most interesting piece is likely how
they prompt engineered each person and the overall system to work with
a non-state preserving API like gpt-3.5-turbo. 

CHATGPT EXPANDS ITS ‚ÄòCUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS‚Äô FEATURE TO FREE USERS (1
MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/10/chatgpt-expands-its-custom-instructions-feature-to-free-users/?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI announced that it‚Äôs expanding custom instructions ‚Äî a way
to give users more control over how ChatGPT responds ‚Äî to all users,
including those on the free tier of the service. 

NEWS OUTLETS DEMAND NEW RULES FOR AI TRAINING DATA (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827316/news-transparency-copyright-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai]

Several media organizations have called for rules protecting copyright
in data used to train generative AI models. They have signed an open
letter urging lawmakers around the globe to consider regulations that
require transparency in training datasets and the consent of rights
holders before using data for training. The letter also requests
allowing media companies to negotiate with AI model operators and
identify AI-generated content, and mandates that AI companies
eliminate bias and misinformation in their services.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ENHANCING LLAMA-2 MODEL'S PERFORMANCE THROUGH IN-CONTEXT LEARNING (8
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04275v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This paper studied in-context learning with the pretrained Llama-2
language model by retrieving 9 demonstration examples during
chat-style prompts. The method, which didn't alter the model's
weights, resulted in a 7x win-rate increase compared to the
text-davinci-003 model, making it on par with models that underwent
alignment fine-tuning. 

IMPROVING 3D OBJECT DETECTION USING DETR (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04409v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Current 3D object detectors often misinterpret data, causing them to
focus on distant points. The authors of this paper have developed a
new method, 3D Vertex Relative Position Encoding, that directs the
detector's attention to points close to the target objects. 

IMPROVING IMAGE-TEXT MATCHING WITH THE FALSE NEGATIVE ELIMINATION
STRATEGY (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04380v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Traditional image-text matching models often mistakenly use highly
similar but not matching samples, known as false negatives, which can
misguide the learning process. This paper introduces the False
Negative Elimination strategy, a novel method that carefully selects
negatives by assessing their probability of being false negatives.

MAKING LEGAL RESEARCH FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/exploration-lab/il-pcr?utm_source=tldrai]

This repository introduces a new tool called U-CREAT, which uses event
extraction to find relevant past legal cases faster and more
accurately. It also presents the IL-PCR corpus, a vast collection of
Indian legal cases, and shows how U-CREAT performs excellently not
only in the Indian legal system but also in the Canadian system. 

BOOSTING THE PRECISION OF VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/factodeeplearning/multitaskvlfm?utm_source=tldrai]

This repository introduces a multitasking strategy that improves the
performance of vision-language models like CLIP specifically in tasks
like detailed attribute detection and pinpointing locations within
images. 

CHIDORI, BUILD RELIABLE AI AGENTS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ThousandBirdsInc/chidori?utm_source=tldrai]

Chidori is a reactive runtime for building AI agents. It provides a
framework for building AI agents that are reactive, observable, and
robust. It supports building agents with Node.js, Python, and Rust.

PINECONE‚ÄôS JOURNEY FROM SEED TO 10,000 SIGN-UPS PER DAY (9 MINUTE
READ)
[https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/pinecones-journey-from-seed-to-10000/?utm_source=tldrai]

We‚Äôve posted a lot about product-led growth (PLG) lately. This is
another great example of a company nailing PLG. The key takeaways
include being really thoughtful about who you‚Äôre building the
product for, focusing on a defined persona, and then making their
pathway to try your product as frictionless as possible. The
traditional B2B marketing playbook didn‚Äôt land for Pinecone‚Äôs
product. 

META DISBANDS PROTEIN FOLDING TEAM (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.ft.com/content/919c05d2-b894-4812-aa1a-dd2ab6de794a?utm_source=tldrai]

Meta had one of the most prolific protein folding teams in the
industry. However, the team was disbanded in the push towards the
commercialization of AI systems. This, along with large labs reducing
their publication output, is a sad side-effect of generative AI‚Äôs
success. 

SOFTBANK UPS STAKE IN SYMBOTIC IN JOINT VENTURE DEAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.vn/pZNLg?utm_source=tldrai]

SoftBank Group is establishing an AI-based warehousing joint venture
with Symbotic Inc. called GreenBox Systems LLC with a combined
investment of $100 million. SoftBank will also purchase $7.5 billion
of Symbotic's AI systems for warehousing. This move strengthens
SoftBank's commitment to robotics and AI-driven supply chain
solutions.
