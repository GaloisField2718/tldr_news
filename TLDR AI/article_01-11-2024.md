 GET THE WORLD'S FASTEST WHISPER INFERENCE WITH BASETEN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Baseten's model performance engineers have built the world's fastest
inference engine for Whisper, the best open-source audio transcription
(speech-to-text) AI model.

➡️ Over 400x real-time factor (1 hour transcribed in <9 seconds)

➡️ Best word error rate with domain-specific corrections

➡️ Lowest cost per hour for Whisper V3 (up to 80% cheaper than
OpenAI)

This is the fastest, most accurate, least expensive Whisper inference
on the market, counting custom hardware providers.

ML engineering teams at AI-native companies like Bland AI
[5] and Patreon [6] trust Baseten for mission-critical Whisper
inference thanks to:

✅ Secure and HIPAA-compliant dedicated deployments

✅ Best-in-class reliability and observability

✅ Optional self-hosted deployments to customer VPCs
