OPENAI RELEASES GPT-4 (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/research/gpt-4?utm_source=tldrai] 

It‚Äôs finally here! GPT-4 is a smarter, safer, and more robust
version of its predecessor. GPT-4 is safer and more aligned, but still
has limitations. It is 82% less likely to respond to requests for
disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses
than GPT-3.5 based on internal evaluations. Companies like Duolingo,
Khan Academy, and Stripe are already using the service. Also, a
correction from yesterday‚Äôs newsletter: previous rumors that GPT-4
will include text-to-video capabilities are actually not true. GPT-4
has not yet made the leap to multimodal outputs like video, but it can
take in both video and text as inputs! 

GOOGLE UNVEILS NEW PALM API AND MAKERSUITE TOOL (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-developers-google-cloud-workspace/?utm_source=tldrai]


Google has announced the PaLM API, a new offering that allows
developers to experiment with large language models in a safe and easy
way. Along with the API, they are releasing MakerSuite, a tool that
enables developers to quickly and easily prototype generative AI
applications. The tools will be available through a Private Preview to
select developers, with a waitlist expected to follow. This
announcement signifies Google's commitment to making AI accessible and
empowering developers to build the next generation of applications. 

ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES CLAUDE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/anthropic-launches-claude-a-chatbot-to-rival-openais-chatgpt/?utm_source=tldrai]


Anthropic, one of OpenAI‚Äôs main rivals, launched Claude, a chatbot
rival to ChatGPT. Anthropic was co-founded by ex-OpenAI employees.
Claude can be instructed to perform a range of tasks, including
searching across documents, summarizing, writing and coding, and
answering questions about particular topics. But Anthropic makes the
case that Claude is ‚Äúmuch less likely to produce harmful outputs,‚Äù
‚Äúeasier to converse with‚Äù and ‚Äúmore steerable‚Äù than OpenAI‚Äôs
ChatGPT.

NEW PRE-TRAINING PARADIGM IMPROVES LANGUAGE MODELS' CAPABILITIES (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07295?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper proposes a new pre-training paradigm that improves the
training data efficiency and capabilities of language models in the
infilling task. The paradigm includes a bidirectional training
objective that aligns the predictions of left-to-right and
right-to-left LMs and a bidirectional inference procedure. The
approach is evaluated on programming and natural language models and
outperforms strong baselines. 

MODEL-TUNING VIA PROMPTS: IMPROVING ADVERSARIAL ROBUSTNESS IN NLP (15
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07320?utm_source=tldrai] 

The MVP method demonstrates surprising gains in adversarial
robustness, improving performance against adversarial word-level
synonym substitutions by an average of 8% over standard methods, and
even outperforming state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By modifying the
input with a prompt template instead of modifying the model by
appending an MLP head, MVP achieves better results in downstream tasks
while maintaining clean accuracy.

UNIDIFFUSER: A UNIFIED DIFFUSION FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-MODAL DATA
DISTRIBUTION FITTING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/thu-ml/unidiffuser?utm_source=tldrai] 

UniDiffuser is a framework for fitting all distributions relevant to
multi-modal data in one model. It achieves this by unifying diffusion
models for marginal, conditional, and joint distributions. UniDiffuser
is able to perform image, text, text-to-image, image-to-text, and
image-text pair generation with high-quality results and competitive
quantitative scores.

APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING BY CORNELL UNIVERSITY (ONLINE COURSE)
[https://kuleshov-group.github.io/aml-website/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This open online course is a broad introduction to the field of
machine learning (ML), based on CS 5785 at Cornell Tech. It covers
machine learning algorithms (linear regression, kernel methods, neural
networks, etc.), their mathematical foundations, and their
implementation. We are thrilled to make this material open to everyone
and welcome you to the course. 

WONDER DYNAMICS RELEASES WONDER STUDIO (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://wonderdynamics.com/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Wonder Studio is an AI tool that automatically animates, lights and
composes CG characters into a live-action scene. Think of it as the
VFX Studio in your browser. 

MICROSOFT HAS LAID OFF ONE OF ITS RESPONSIBLE AI TEAMS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.platformer.news/p/microsoft-just-laid-off-one-of-its?utm_source=tldrai]


Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team within the
artificial intelligence organization as part of recent layoffs that
affected 10,000 employees across the company, Platformer has learned.
The move leaves Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure its AI
principles are closely tied to product design at a time when the
company is leading the charge to make AI tools available to the
mainstream, current and former employees said.
