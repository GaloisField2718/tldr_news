 COFFEE AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO DEMONSTRATE SECURE AI PRACTICES WITH
ISO 42001 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI is everywhere, but customers need to know that you're using it
safely and responsibly. The ISO 42001 standard [4] helps companies
demonstrate their AI security practices in a verifiable way.

Join Vanta and A-LIGN for a Coffee and Compliance session on ISO 42001
[4]‚Äîwhat it is, what types of organizations need it, and how it
works. The discussion also covers practical strategies and best
practices for successfully integrating ISO 42001 into your
organization.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTEL REVEALS FIRST LUNAR LAKE LAPTOP CPUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO
KNOW (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Intel has unveiled its Core Ultra 200V lineup, previously known as
Lunar Lake, boasting superior AI performance, fast CPUs, and
competitive integrated GPUs for thin laptops. The processors feature
eight CPU cores, integrated memory, and enhanced efficiency but are
limited to 32GB RAM. Major manufacturers like Acer, Asus, Dell, and HP
will launch laptops with these new chips. Reviews are pending to
confirm Intel's claims. 

 OPENAI, STILL HAUNTED BY ITS CHAOTIC PAST, IS TRYING TO GROW UP (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is restructuring its management and organization to attract
major investors like Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia while aiming for a
$100 billion valuation. The company faces internal conflicts about its
mission and safety practices, leading to significant staff turnover,
including key researchers joining rivals like Anthropic. Despite
growing revenues and user base, OpenAI grapples with balancing profit
motives and ethical concerns in advancing AI technologies. 

 CANVA SAYS ITS AI FEATURES ARE WORTH THE 300 PERCENT PRICE INCREASE
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Canva is increasing prices for its Teams subscriptions by over 300%
due to new generative AI features. Users report prices rising from
$120 to $500 annually, though a discount brings it down to $300 for
the first year. These changes reflect the value added by AI tools like
Magic Media and Magic Expand.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEPTHCRAFTER: CONSISTENT LONG DEPTH SEQUENCES FOR OPEN WORLD VIDEOS
(23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 By using Stable Diffusion video as a prior model, researchers were
able to generate extremely precise depth information without using any
camera pose or optical flow information. 

 MODIFYING LLMS FOR DIRECTED CHEMICAL SPACE EXPLORATION (31 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 By using supervised fine-tuning and DPO style data on open source
language models, LLMs can be prompted to generate molecules that have
interesting properties for drug development. 

 PLANNING IN NATURAL LANGUAGE IMPROVES LLM SEARCH FOR CODE GENERATION
(18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 One of the challenges of code generation is getting diverse candidate
solutions. Oftentimes, even repeated sampling fails to generate enough
novelty to solve a problem. However, if you plan in natural language
first and brainstorm candidate solution paths, then generation is
significantly more diverse and varied leading to improved code
generation solutions.

 WILL AI MAKE US OVERCONFIDENT? (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Students are increasingly using AI tools like ChatGPT to solve
challenging research problems, surprising educators with their rapid
progress. AI-enhanced development tools, especially in coding,
significantly boost ambition and productivity but come with risks of
overconfidence and errors. Despite inaccuracies, AI provides valuable
interactive entry points to complex tasks, potentially encouraging
more proactive learning and cross-disciplinary exploration. 

 LLMS STRUGGLE TO EXPLAIN THEMSELVES (20 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 An interactive demo was used to test LLMs' ability to recognize and
explain number sequences generated by random programs. The results
showed that while LLMs often identify the correct sequence, their
explanations for the patterns were frequently incorrect. This
highlights the current limitations in LLMs' reasoning abilities
despite their performance on standardized tests.
