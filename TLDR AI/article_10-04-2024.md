HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE GEMMA EXPANDED MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google has trained a code Gemma and Recurrent Gemma models. They get
competitive performance and include FIM capabilities. The recurrent
model is much faster and more memory efficient. 

 META CONFIRMS THAT LLAMA 3 IS COMING NEXT MONTH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has confirmed plans to release Llama 3, the next generation of
its large language model for generative AI assistants, within the next
month. 

 FOUR TAKEAWAYS ON THE RACE TO AMASS DATA FOR A.I. (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The development of AI, particularly large language models like GPT-3,
is heavily reliant on vast amounts of data, with companies like Meta
and Google racing to gather more as high-quality online data may run
out by 2026. Tech giants are employing controversial methods,
including using YouTube data and considering the purchase of
publishers, to fuel their AI advancements. The use of 'synthetic' data
is a potential solution, though it carries the risk of amplifying AI
errors.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SWAP ANYTHING (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SwapAnything is a new algorithm that can replace things in a picture
with other things you choose, without changing the rest of the
picture. It's better than other tools because it can swap any object,
not just the main subject, and it's really good at making the new
object fit perfectly into the original picture. It uses inversion,
concept vectors, and a pretrained diffusion model. 

 IMPROVING STABLE DIFFUSION WITH UNIFIED FEEDBACK (17 MINUTE READ) [8]


 UniFL is a method that improves the output quality of diffusion
models using a fairly complicated cascade of feedback steps. These all
serve to improve the visual quality, aesthetics, and preference
alignment of the image generation models. The techniques are agnostic
to the underlying model and can be used to improve any image
generation models. 

 ENHANCING OBJECT DETECTION IN SINGLE-DOMAIN (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Addressing the challenge of single-domain generalization (S-DG) in
object detection, the new OA-DG method introduces OA-Mix for data
augmentation and OA-Loss for training.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 R2R: THE OPEN-SOURCE FRAMEWORK FOR FAST RAG DEVELOPMENT AND
DEPLOYMENT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Rag to Riches (R2R) is the simplest way to build and deploy RAG
pipelines into production. With intuitive configuration files, full
customization via code, and response streaming, R2R accelerates LLM
application development.
R2R supports both remote and local deployment, allowing you to
autoscale your RAG pipeline in the cloud with SciPhi or deploy it
on-premises for full control.

Visit the R2R GitHub ( [11]‚≠ê 1.1K stars) to get started today. [11]

 VISUAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Code for the recent ‚Äúnext-resolution prediction‚Äù work that frames
image generation as progressive prediction of increasing resolution.
The repository includes inference scripts and a demo notebook. The
training code will be released soon. 

 CHEMISTRY BENCH FOR LANGUAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A Big-Bench compatible benchmark for evaluating large language model
capabilities on chemistry questions. This benchmark can help measure
the scientific ability of various language models. 

 THE SQUEEZEATTENTION FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A new method called SqueezeAttention has been developed to optimize
the Key-Value cache of large language models, significantly reducing
memory usage by 30% to 70% and doubling the throughput.

 INTEL DETAILS GAUDI 3 AT VISION 2024 (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Intel has announced its new Gaudi 3 AI processors, claiming up to
1.7X the training performance, 50% better inference, and 40% better
efficiency than Nvidia's H100 processors at a lower cost. 

 ‚ÄòIT‚ÄôS VERY EASY TO STEAL SOMEONE‚ÄôS VOICE‚Äô: HOW AI IS
AFFECTING VIDEO GAME ACTORS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cissy Jones, a renowned voice artist, co-founded Morpheme to offer
ethical AI voice modeling after her voice was used without consent.
Morpheme ensures actors consent and are compensated for AI-generated
vocal content. The broader industry's rush to AI adoption may sideline
human talent and ignore actors' rights. As the video game industry
integrates AI, Sag-Aftra union negotiations aim to protect performers'
consent and fair compensation. 

 CAN DEMIS HASSABIS SAVE GOOGLE? (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis now leads Google's unified AI
research arm, aiming to maintain the tech giant's edge in the AI
landscape with breakthroughs like AlphaGo and AlphaFold. Despite the
success, challenges in integrating AI into tangible products and
competition from entities such as OpenAI's ChatGPT persist. Hassabis,
recognized for his significant contributions to AI, must now navigate
Google's product strategy to leverage DeepMind's research
advancements.
