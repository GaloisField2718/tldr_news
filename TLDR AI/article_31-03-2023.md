RESEARCH & INNOVATION

HIPER: PERSONALIZING IMAGE GENERATION AND MANIPULATION WITH HIGHLY
PERSONALIZED TEXT EMBEDDING (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08767?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper presents a new approach called HiPer, which uses highly
personalized text embedding to achieve personalization and content
manipulation in image generation and manipulation without the need for
model fine-tuning or identifiers. The approach enables manipulation of
background, texture, and motion with just a single image and target
text, producing highly personalized and complex semantic image edits
across a wide range of tasks. The authors believe that their novel
understanding of the text embedding space has the potential to inspire
further research across various tasks. 

PIANO PLAYING AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://kzakka.com/robopianist/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Player pianos have existed since before computers, but now a computer
can play the piano by controlling robotic fingers. This is a
fascinating control problem that allows an RL agent to learn how to
control dexterous fingers to play piano. There is an interactive demo
that lets you poke and prod the hands while they play. 

DREAMBOOTH3D: PERSONALIZING TEXT-TO-3D GENERATIVE MODELS WITH FEW
IMAGES (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://dreambooth3d.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

DreamBooth3D is a new approach that personalizes text-to-3D generative
models with as few as 3-6 casually captured images of a subject. The
method combines recent advances in personalizing text-to-image models
with text-to-3D generation, overcoming the issue of overfitting to
input viewpoints through a 3-stage optimization strategy. DreamBooth3D
can produce high-quality, subject-specific 3D assets with text-driven
modifications such as novel poses, colors, and attributes that are not
seen in any of the input images of the subject.

HOLODIFFUSION: TRAINING A 3D DIFFUSION MODEL USING 2D IMAGES (GITHUB
REPO) [https://holodiffusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study presents a novel diffusion setup that addresses the
challenges of data scarcity and computational complexity in 3D
generative modeling by utilizing posed 2D images and decoupling model
memory from spatial memory. The approach demonstrates scalability,
robust training, and competitive sample quality when applied to the
CO3D dataset. 

XTURING (GITHUB REPO)
