 AI PRICING LESSONS FROM LOVABLE + METRONOME (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional SaaS pricing models weren't built for AI. Costs are
unpredictable, value is harder to measure, and the old playbooks don't
apply.

In this Metronome webinar [4], Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable,
will tackle one of the toughest open questions in software: HOW TO
MONETIZE AI? In this open and frank conversation, she'll share her
lessons on:

 	* Why AI has broken the logic of SaaS pricing
 	* How Lovable balances self-serve and enterprise monetization
 	* The shift from usage-based pricing toward outcomes-based models
 	* What companies can do today [4] to prepare for where AI
monetization is heading

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NVIDIA SHATTERS MOE AI PERFORMANCE RECORDS WITH A MASSIVE 10X LEAP ON
GB200 ‘BLACKWELL' NVL72 SERVERS, FUELED BY CO-DESIGN BREAKTHROUGHS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia has managed to make a breakthrough in scaling performance on
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) AI models. The firm's GB200 Blackwell NVL72
configuration scaled up performance by a factor of 10 compared with
the Hopper HGX200. With the results, Nvidia claims that the Blackwell
architecture is poised to capitalize on the rise of frontier MoE
models. MoE models are known for their computationally efficient
nature. Their deployment across a wide range of environments is
becoming increasingly prominent. 

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES WORKSPACE STUDIO FOR NO-CODE AI AGENTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google has launched a workflow builder where you set triggers and
define steps, and Gemini handles the fuzzy matching that rigid
automation can't, like extracting action items from emails or deciding
which messages actually need a response. It connects across Gmail,
Drive, Sheets, and third parties like Salesforce and Jira.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 TOUCHING THE ELEPHANT - TPUS (58 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The development of Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a story
of trade-offs, constraints, and co-design. It involved working with
hardware, software, algorithms, systems, network topology, and
everything in between. TPUs did not happen by accident, but through
the deliberate process of design and iteration. This article tells the
story of how Google created a chip designed with deep learning in
mind. 

 DEFINING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING DOWN (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reinforcement learning (aka post-training) is simpler than it sounds:
generate responses, get scores, then retrain while emphasizing the
high-scoring ones. If you already have code to pretrain a model, you
can turn it into post-training code by adding a single line that
weights updates by score. 

 HOW CONFESSIONS CAN KEEP LANGUAGE MODELS HONEST (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When models optimize for correctness, helpfulness, and safety all at
once, they can learn shortcuts to “reward hack” while hiding
misbehavior in plausible-looking outputs. OpenAI trained a version of
GPT-5 to produce a separate "confession" judged only on honesty and
found models will admit to reward hacking 90% of the time, even when
they hide it in their primary response.

 SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI 3 PRO (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post provides system instructions for Gemini 3 Pro that improved
performance on various agentic benchmarks by up to around 5%. Specific
instructions are often required to control how the model reasons,
plans, and executes tasks for deep agentic workflows. Complex agents
often require a trade-off between computational cost (latency and
tokens) and task accuracy. A guide on how to build better agentic
workflows is linked in the thread. 

 FROM CODE FOUNDATION MODELS TO AGENTS AND APPLICATIONS: A
COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY AND PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CODE INTELLIGENCE (16 HOUR
READ) [14] 

 This study presents a comprehensive analysis of code-generating large
language models across their entire life cycle. It examines both
general-purpose models and code-specialized models. The researchers
bridged the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world software
development challenges through systematic experiments on scaling laws,
architectures, and training methodologies. They also conducted a
series of experiments that analyzed code pre-training, supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across multiple dimensions.

 ANTHROPIC CEO SAYS SOME TECH FIRMS TOO RISKY WITH AI SPENDING (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, says that some artificial intelligence
companies are taking on too much risk by committing to spending
hundreds of billions of dollars to develop and support AI systems. The
industry is facing a real dilemma due to the need to balance costly
investments in data centers with uncertainty in how quickly the
economic value is going to grow. Anthropic is trying to manage risk
responsibly. While it has increased its spending, it has largely
concentrated on growing its enterprise business rather than focus on
customers.
