HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT RELEASES POWERFUL NEW PHI-3.5 MODELS, BEATING GOOGLE,
OPENAI, AND MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft launched three new models in its Phi series:
Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct, and
Phi-3.5-vision-instruct, each addressing different AI tasks with
impressive benchmark performances. These models are open source under
the MIT License and available for developers on Hugging Face. Despite
their smaller size compared to some counterparts, the Phi models have
achieved near-state-of-the-art results, surpassing competitors like
GPT-4o and Llama in certain benchmarks. 

 WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN MACHINE LEARNING (28 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Wolfram|Alpha, wrote a great
exploration about different phenomena going on in machine learning
models. He discovered a set of dynamics about the non-linearities in
simple neural networks. 

 AGI SAFETY AND ALIGNMENT AT GOOGLE DEEPMIND (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google DeepMind's AGI Safety & Alignment team shared a detailed
update on their work focused on existential risk from AI. Key areas
include amplified oversight, frontier safety, and mechanistic
interpretability, with ongoing efforts to refine their approach to
technical AGI safety. They highlighted recent achievements,
collaborations, and plans to address emerging challenges.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ENERGY-EFFICIENT AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WITH SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS (19
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD) is the first unified Spiking Neural
Network (SNN) aimed at addressing the energy challenges of autonomous
driving. 

 EFFICIENT LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Inheritune is a streamlined method for developing smaller base
language models from larger ones by inheriting a few transformer
blocks and training on a tiny fraction (0.1%) of the original data.
This approach enabled the creation of a 1.5B parameter model using
only an A6000 GPU in less than half a day, achieving results that
compete well against larger models trained on significantly more data.


 TIME SERIES REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (16 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Time Series Diffusion Embedding (TSDE) is the first diffusion-based
approach for time series representation learning. TSDE segments time
series data and uses dual-orthogonal Transformer encoders with a
crossover mechanism to generate informative embeddings.

 EFFICIENT TRITON KERNELS FOR LLM TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Liger Kernel, released surprisingly by LinkedIn, is an efficient
set of kernels for language model training. It increases throughput by
20% and decreases memory usage by almost 60% for the popular Llama
models. Importantly for practitioners, it only requires 3 lines of
code change and integrates with many popular modeling frameworks. 

 POSTGRESQL IS A GOOD VECTOR DATABASE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 pgvectorscale builds on pgvector with higher performance embedding
search and cost-efficient storage for AI applications. It is around
28x faster than competitive and commonly used vector stores. 

 REDUCING GENDER BIAS IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 GenderCARE is a comprehensive framework aimed at assessing and
mitigating gender biases. It introduces innovative criteria for
evaluating gender bias, emphasizing inclusivity, diversity, and
objectivity.

 TEACHING CHAT MODELS TO SOLVE CHESS (28 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Traditional base language models are quite good at playing chess,
averaging around 1800 elo. However, chat models tend to struggle with
a precipitous drop in performance. This post explores how to tune chat
models like GPT-4o to play chess through a combination of prompting
and fine-tuning. 

 DATA EXFILTRATION FROM SLACK AI VIA INDIRECT PROMPT INJECTION (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A vulnerability in Slack AI was discovered where attackers can
exfiltrate data from private channels they aren't members of via
indirect prompt injection. It allows attackers to use public channel
messages to manipulate the LLM into divulging private information,
such as API keys, in query responses. This issue, alongside a phishing
attack vector, persists even after Slack AI's August 14th update
incorporating channel and DM files, significantly expanding the risk
surface area for such exploits. 

 GENERALIZED SEGMENT ANYTHING MODEL (24 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Generalized SAM (GSAM) is a new method for fine-tuning the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with variable-size images more efficiently.

 NEW SIGLIP MODEL (HUGGING FACE HUB) [19] 

 Google has released a new SigLIP model that uses a shape optimized
vision transformer model architecture. 

 3D OCCUPANCY ESTIMATION (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 GaussianOcc is a method for fully self-supervised and efficient 3D
occupancy estimation using surround views. 

 BRINGING LLAMA 3 TO LIFE (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Meta has introduced Llama 3.1, an advanced open-source LLM that
brings new capabilities like synthetic data generation and model
distillation.
