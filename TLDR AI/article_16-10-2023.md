RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FLASH DECODING FOR 8X INFERENCE SPEED UP (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://pytorch.org/blog/flash-decoding/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Flash Attention dramatically speeds up the training of large language
models. However, when running inference, the batch size is usually 1.
This means Flash Attention provides little benefit. Flash Decoding was
developed by the same group and brings optimizations to token
generation. 

 USING TRANSFORMERS FOR MULTIPLE LANGUAGE TASKS (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08232v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Researchers explore the potential of pre-trained transformer decoders
to create universal embeddings for both natural and programming
languages. With minimal training on English data, these models excel
in various tasks, from classification to code search. 

 A NEW APPROACH FOR AUDIO-VISUAL SEGMENTATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08303v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This paper introduces the Explicit Conditional Multimodal Variational
Auto-Encoder (ECMVAE) for better identification of sound sources in
