HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 3 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has trained three new models in the Claude 3 family, the
strongest of which matches GPT4‚Äôs reported benchmark results. It is
also a multimodal model and performs well on vision tasks.
Importantly, Claude's coding ability is substantially improved with
this release. 

 CHATGPT CAN READ ITS ANSWERS OUT LOUD (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI introduced a Read Aloud feature for ChatGPT, allowing it to
verbally respond to users in 37 languages with five voice options and
enhancing its multimodal capabilities and usability for on-the-go
interactions across web and mobile platforms.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SUPPORTING LONGER CONTEXT LENGTH IN LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have developed a new technique called Resonance RoPE to
help LLMs better understand and generate text in longer sequences than
they were originally trained on. This method, which improves on the
existing Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) system, enhances model
performance on long texts without extra computing effort. 

 UNDERSTANDING OBJECT RELATIONS IN IMAGES (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The All-Seeing Project V2 introduces the ASMv2 model, which blends
text generation, object localization, and understanding the
connections between objects in images. 

 A NEW COMPLEX BENCHMARK FOR AI SYSTEMS (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new dataset called GPQA presents a real challenge with 448 tough
multiple-choice questions in biology, physics, and chemistry. Even
domain experts struggle, scoring around 65% accuracy, while
non-experts only manage 34%. Advanced AI systems like GPT-4 achieve
just 39% accuracy. This dataset is aimed at developing methods for
supervising AI outputs in complex scientific questions.

 üéß¬†LESS HYPE, MORE PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING IN THE MLOPS
COMMUNITY PODCAST (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Twitter demos are cool, but who is really using AI in production?
Tune in to the MLOps.community Podcast [11] for weekly chats with
community members who are _actually_ building ML/AI systems in
production. Catch the latest episode on Spotify now [11] 

 CLAUDE 3 OPUS FOR VIDEO SUMMARIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Andrej Karpathy issued a long context challenge to make a blog post
from a recent video of his. Claude 3 was able to perform this task
with some data pre-processing help. The resulting blog post is high
quality and interesting. 

 ENHANCED IMAGE RESTORATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Dual-domain strip attention mechanism is a new method that
significantly improves image restoration tasks. 

 OPEN SORA PLAN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project aims to reproduce OpenAI‚Äôs text-to-video model Sora.
It is currently building out the basic components and searching for
interested open-source contributors to assist.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ENHANCING MODELS‚Äô CONFIDENCE WITH SURE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SURE is a novel method that combines various techniques to improve
the reliability of uncertainty predictions in deep neural networks,
especially for image classification tasks. 

 AGGREGATOR‚ÄôS AI RISK (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The influence of the printing press on the dissemination of
information and the formation of nation-states mirrors the impact of
the Internet, particularly through Aggregators like Google and Meta.
However, the emergence of generative AI challenges the Aggregator
model by providing singular answers that reflect embedded worldviews,
potentially undermining the universal appeal that underpins Aggregator
economics and suggesting a shift towards personalized AI to maintain
their dominance. 

 IS SYNTHETIC DATA THE KEY TO AGI? (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The effectiveness of large language models is primarily influenced by
the quality of their training data. Projections suggest that
high-quality data will be scarce by 2027. Synthetic data generation
emerges as a promising solution to this challenge, potentially
reshaping internet business models and highlighting the importance of
equitable data access and antitrust considerations.
