 DEEPSEEK'S NEW REASONING MODEL SURPASSES OPENAI'S O1 (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 DeepSeek says that its latest reasoning-focused AI model outperforms
OpenAI's O1 model on specific benchmarks, citing improvements in
logical inference and factual accuracy. 

 OPENAI QUIETLY FUNDED INDEPENDENT MATH BENCHMARK BEFORE SETTING
RECORD WITH O3 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's record success with the o3 model on the FrontierMath
benchmark revealed its undisclosed funding of the project. Despite
excellence in solving complex math problems, a lapse in transparency
was admitted by benchmark developer Epoch AI. Future collaboration
promises improved openness, particularly regarding funding and data
access. 

 PERPLEXITY AI SUBMITS BID TO MERGE WITH TIKTOK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Perplexity AI has submitted a bid to merge with TikTok US as a TikTok
ban approaches. The proposal aims to combine Perplexity, TikTok US,
and new equity partners while allowing ByteDance investors to retain
their equity. Perplexity's merger offer seeks to integrate more video
content into its AI search operations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF MICROSTRUCTURES (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpticFusion is a multimodal neural implicit 3D reconstruction of
microstructures that fuses white light interferometry and optical
microscopy. 

 DEEPSEEK R1 PAPER (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeepSeek has released a paper along with its strong MIT licensed
reasoning models. Importantly, the paper shows that there is no need
for extremely fancy process reward models. DeepSeek simply used
accuracy of answer, a formatting reward, and large scale RL to
encourage reasoning in the model. It found that distilling this
reasoning ability via SFT to smaller models gave an incredible boost
in final performance. 

 EVOLVING DEEPER LLM THINKING (22 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Contrary to the direct R1 approach, this work from DeepMind uses an
evolutionary strategy, guided by a language model, to modify and
propose new responses. This leads to strong reasoning ability,
specifically in planning tasks that require some exploration.
