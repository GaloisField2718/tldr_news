HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 REKA HAS A NEW POWERFUL MULTI-MODAL MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI startup Reka has announced a 21B parameter model that was trained
completely from scratch. It is natively multimodal and surpasses Llama
70B and Mixtral on a number of key benchmarks. Importantly, given
where the founders of the company used to work, it also matches Gemini
Pro. The model is available for use in Reka's playground. 

 APPLE RELEASES MGIE, A REVOLUTIONARY AI MODEL FOR INSTRUCTION-BASED
IMAGE EDITING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has launched MGIE, an open-source AI model for image editing
that uses multimodal large language models to interpret text
instructions and execute pixel-level edits. 

 DEEPMIND FRAMEWORK OFFERS BREAKTHROUGH IN LLMS‚Äô REASONING (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 DeepMind and USC researchers have developed SELF-DISCOVER, a new
framework that significantly improves LLM reasoning capabilities,
outperforming traditional methods by up to 32% on tasks with models
like GPT-4. The two-stage framework allows LLMs to form and utilize
reasoning structures autonomously. This advancement represents a major
step toward more sophisticated AI problem-solving abilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CONTROLLING REAL WORLD OBJECTS WITH FLUID IN RL (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 "Box o Flows" introduces a novel experimental system for testing
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in dynamic real-world settings,
addressing the challenge of simulating complex fluid dynamics for RL
applications. It showcases the ability of model-free RL algorithms to
generate complex behaviors from simple rewards and enhances data
efficiency via offline RL and paves the way for broader RL
applicability in complex systems. 

 WEBLINX CONVERSATIONAL WEB SCRAPING DATASET (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Weblinx is a dataset of 100k web-based interactions in a
conversational format. It was released to improve the study of
language model guided web-based navigation. 

 3D AVATARS WITH IMPLICITDEEPFAKE1 (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper introduces ImplicitDeepfake1, a new approach that combines
deepfake technology with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian
Splatting (GS) to create highly realistic 3D avatars.

 GUIDING INSTRUCTION-BASED IMAGE EDITING VIA MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Apple released code that uses multimodal language models to improve
human-provided natural language edits to images. 

 LAG-LLAMA: TOWARDS FOUNDATION MODELS FOR PROBABILISTIC TIME SERIES
FORECASTING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Lag-Llama introduces a breakthrough in time series forecasting with a
transformer-based model that excels in zero-shot and few-shot
generalization, pre-trained on a broad spectrum of time series data.
It surpasses existing deep learning methods in state-of-the-art
performance through fine-tuning on minimal data, marking a significant
advancement in foundation models for time series analysis. 

 LEARNING TO FLY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A repository for training end-to-end control policies using deep
reinforcement learning. The training is done in simulation and is
finished within seconds on a consumer-grade laptop. The trained
policies generalize and can be deployed on real quadrotors.

 MASSED MUDDLER INTELLIGENCE (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The concept of Massed Muddler Intelligence (MMI) represents a shift
from traditional monolithic AI scaling towards a model based on
distributed, agent-based systems that learn and adapt in real time.
Grounded in principles of embodiment, boundary intelligence,
temporality, and personhood, MMI advocates for AI development that
emphasizes scalable, interactive agents with a degree of autonomy and
mutual governance, moving away from the current focus on accumulating
larger datasets and computational resources. 

 AI COULD ACTUALLY HELP REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS (16 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Elon Musk and Geoffrey Hinton's views on AI as a job-eliminating
force contrast with the reality that the industrialized world faces a
labor shortage exacerbated by demographic trends, suggesting a future
where work is plentiful but the nature of expertise and employment
will evolve. AI, rather than making human jobs obsolete, offers the
potential to democratize and extend expertise, enabling a broader
workforce to engage in high-stakes decision-making and restoring a
middle-skill, middle-class job market hollowed out by automation and
globalization. 

 PACKING FOR LLM TRAINING (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Packing in training models is a way to improve training efficiently
by concatenating examples. If done incorrectly, contamination can
occur between examples because the attention doesn‚Äôt know where to
stop. The community has found that EOS is often sufficient, but there
still can be problems. This repository provides an implementation in
Hugging Face for common models to properly pack input data.

 META WILL START LABELING AI-GENERATED IMAGES FROM OTHER COMPANIES (1
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Meta plans to combat the spread of fake images on its platforms by
detecting and labeling AI-generated content, even if produced by rival
services. 

 AXOLOTL ADDS MPS SUPPORT (1 MINUTE READ) [20]
