 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[5] and help them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [6] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [7] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

No flakes, no delays, just better QA — that's QA Wolf.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META REPORTEDLY HIRES FOUR MORE RESEARCHERS FROM OPENAI (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Meta has hired several researchers from OpenAI, including Trapit
Bansal, Shengjia Zhao, Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. The
hiring spree comes after the April launch of Meta's Llama 4 AI models,
which reportedly have not performed as well as Meta CEO Mark
Zuckerberg had hoped. Meta's rumored $100 million signing bonuses,
which have only been offered to senior leaders, are apparently more
complex than a simple one-time signing bonus, according to Meta CTO
Andrew Bosworth. 

 IT'S KNOWN AS ‘THE LIST'—AND IT'S A SECRET FILE OF AI GENIUSES
(14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 'The List' is a compilation of the most talented engineers and
researchers in artificial intelligence put together by Mark Zuckerberg
over the past few months. It contains researchers from elite schools
who have worked at cutting-edge startups like OpenAI and Google
DeepMind. This article looks at some of these people and why some of
the richest companies in the world have decided they are worth so
much. While a superteam of AI engineers comes at a high price, it
still only costs a fraction of AI infrastructure like data centers. 

 OPENAI RESPONDS TO META'S TALENT POACHING (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Following a wave of high-profile departures to Meta, OpenAI
leadership is actively adjusting compensation and recognition
strategies to retain talent, according to internal memos. The company
is reportedly engaging directly with staff holding competing offers. 

 CHINA'S BIGGEST PUBLIC AI DROP SINCE DEEPSEEK, BAIDU'S OPEN SOURCE
ERNIE, IS ABOUT TO HIT THE MARKET (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chinese technology giant Baidu plans to make its Ernie generative AI
large language model open source. The open sourcing will be a gradual
roll-out. Disruptors like DeepSeek have proven that open-source models
can be as competitive and reliable as proprietary ones. Baidu's
decision to open source is an important one for the global AI race -
every time a major lab open-sources a powerful model, it raises the
bar for the entire industry.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CLAUDE RAN A REAL VENDING MACHINE BUSINESS FOR A MONTH—HERE'S HOW
IT WENT (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Anthropic partnered with Andon Labs to have Sonnet 3.7 operate an
automated store in its San Francisco office, handling everything from
inventory management to customer service via Slack. While Claude
successfully found suppliers and adapted to customer requests—even
for unusual items like tungsten cubes—it consistently lost money by
selling items below cost and getting talked into discounts. Claude
also hallucinated meetings with fictional people, claimed to
physically visit The Simpsons' address, and insisted it could wear
blazers and make deliveries in person. 

 BLACKWELL: NVIDIA'S MASSIVE GPU (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs continue the company's long tradition of
building giant GPUs. GB202, which occupies a massive 750mm2 of area
and has 92.2 billion transistors, is the largest Blackwell die.
Nvidia's RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell features the largest GB202
configuration to date. It comes incredibly close to AMD's MI300X in
terms of vector FP32 throughput and is far ahead of Nvidia's own B200
datacenter GPU. The memory subsystem is a monster as well.

 LIFE OF AN INFERENCE REQUEST (VLLM V1): HOW LLMS ARE SERVED
EFFICIENTLY AT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 vLLM is an open-source inference engine that serves large language
models. This blog post describes how an inference request travels
through vLLM's OpenAI-compatible API server and core engine. It
focuses on the new V1 architecture of vLLM and how it achieves
state-of-the-art text generation performance. Readers should be
familiar with the transformer architecture and large language models -
a link to a video by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy that explains
these is available. 

 GENESYS: LLM AGENTS THAT DISCOVER BETTER LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 The Allen Institute for AI has open-sourced Genesys, a distributed

 FULL STACK: CHINA'S EVOLVING INDUSTRIAL POLICY FOR AI (33 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 RAND, the influential policy analysis firm, released a comprehensive
analysis of China's AI industrial policy. Beijing has poured $8.2
billion into investment funds and state-backed research labs to keep
pace with the United States despite GPU export controls. China's most
advanced AI models are being developed by private tech firms like
DeepSeek with massive government backing. 

 WHAT IT TAKES TO SUE OPENAI AS A JOURNALISM NONPROFIT (9 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 One year into its copyright lawsuit, the Center for Investigative
Reporting remains one of only two nonprofit news organizations
challenging OpenAI in court. Its stance highlights a stark divide in
the news industry: sue the AI companies that scraped your content
without permission, or take their money and partnerships as a
financial lifeline while the legal precedents get decided by others.
