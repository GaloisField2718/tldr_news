HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING AGENTKIT (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI launched Agent Builder, which is a visual drag-and-drop canvas
called the "Canva for building agents", ChatKit for embedding chat
interfaces, evaluation tools including trace grading and automated
prompt optimization, and a connector registry for linking internal
tools. 

 AMD STOCK SKYROCKETS 23% AS OPENAI LOOKS TO TAKE STAKE IN AI
CHIPMAKER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over multiple
years, starting with 1 gigawatt in late 2026. If the deal is fully
exercised, OpenAI would acquire 10% of AMD. Two weeks ago, OpenAI
agreed to an agreement with Nvidia for $100 billion, with OpenAI's
data center spending commitments now totalling over roughly $1
trillion over the coming years. 

 OPENAI LAUNCHES APPS INSIDE OF CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Users can interact with a set of limited apps directly within ChatGPT
using MCP connectors. The company demoed searching hotels with
Booking.com, researching houses with Zillow, and designing
presentations with Canva. Some believe this is a step towards
monetizing OpenAI's massive free user base, potentially by earning a
finder's fee by referring users to certain products and platforms.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPENAI IS GOOD AT DEALS (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Whenever OpenAI announces a big partnership with a public company,
that company's stock will go up. OpenAI is using that stock value to
subsidize deals. Its deal with AMD involves OpenAI receiving warrants
for up to 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent per share, awarded in
phases if OpenAI hits certain milestones for deployment. AMD's stock
price also has to increase for the warrants to be exercised. While
OpenAI is not publicly traded, it is increasingly making waves in the
stock market. 

 WHY DO LLMS FREAK OUT OVER THE SEAHORSE EMOJI? (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Large language models are very confident that there is a seahorse
emoji. The emoji has never existed, despite some Redditors claiming it
did. This post takes a look at why models might do this. Models just
don't know that their belief about a seahorse emoji existing is wrong
- they can only assume that 'seahorse + emoji' will produce the tokens
it wants.

 SAKANA AI (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ShinkaEvolve, an open-source framework from Sakana AI, uses LLMs to
achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency in evolving programs. It
significantly improves solutions in areas like circle packing, math
competition problem-solving, competitive programming, and LLM training
design. The framework's innovative methodologies include
exploration-exploitation balancing, novelty-based program rejection,
and dynamic LLM prioritization. 

 GOOGLE'S CODEMENDER (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google's CodeMender is an AI agent that automatically detects and
patches code vulnerabilities using Gemini models. Alongside it, it
launched the AI Vulnerability Reward Program and SAIF 2.0 to define
secure-by-design principles for autonomous agents and boost AI-driven
cybersecurity. 

 WHY CAN'T TRANSFORMERS LEARN MULTIPLICATION? REVERSE-ENGINEERING
REVEALS LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCY PITFALLS (28 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers reverse-engineered why language models fail at simple
4×4 multiplication and found successful models naturally built
tree-like attention patterns that "cache" intermediate calculations
then retrieve them later, like jotting down a thought on scratch
paper. Standard training fails because models learn the easy outer
digits first, but get stuck on the middle digits. By adding a simple
auxiliary loss that forces the model to predict running totals at each
step, models dramatically improve.

 CEREBRAS CEO EXPLAINS IPO WITHDRAWAL, SAYS AI CHIPMAKER STILL INTENDS
