RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DISTILLING SYSTEM 2 INTO SYSTEM 1 (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 System 2 models are those that use something like Chain of Thought to
spend more test time compute and improve reasoning. It turns out that
you can distill this behavior into a System 1 model that runs faster
with similar accuracy. 

 LEARNING AT TEST TIME (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new RNN variant that outperforms Mamba on a number of tasks.
Importantly, the update function is itself an ML model - which enables
long contexts and in-context learning. 

 BOOSTING LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODELS WITH SELF-TRAINING (GITHUB
REPO) [10] 

 Video Self-Training with augmented Reasoning (Video-STaR) is a new
approach for improving Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs).

 WHY YOU SHOULD USE A UNIVERSAL SEMANTIC LAYER FOR YOUR SNOWFLAKE DATA
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 A universal semantic layer makes it much easier to run both BI and AI
workloads [12] on your data warehouse. AtScale [12], now available as
a Snowflake Native App in the Snowflake Marketplace, allows you to
define and consume a universal semantic layer directly within your
Snowflake account.

 POP CULTURE (18 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Goldman Sachs released a critical 31-page report titled "Gen AI: Too
Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?", arguing that generative AI's
productivity benefits and returns are significantly limited and that
its power demands will drastically increase utility spending. The
report highlights doubts about AI's ability to transform industries,
pointing out high costs, power grid challenges, and lack of clear
productivity gains or significant revenue generation. It suggests a
potentially bleak future for the technology without major
breakthroughs. 

 THE AI SUMMER (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, which reached 100 million users in two
months, stands in contrast to historical tech developments like the
iPhone and e-commerce, which took years to gain traction. Despite the
initial hype, many users have not found long-term utility with ChatGPT
and enterprise deployment of large language models remains limited,
indicating a need for further development to achieve meaningful
product-market fit and sustained value.
