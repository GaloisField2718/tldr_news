 $80M ARR IN 7 MONTHS: HOW LOVABLE IS TURNING AI PRICING INSIDE OUT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Token pricing. Outcome-based value. Hybrid models. Every AI company
is inventing their own pricing model because traditional SaaS
economics don't apply when every user extracts wildly different value.

Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable, is navigating this in
real-time. She helped Lovable hit $80M ARR in under seven months [4]
with a lean team. On December 10, she's joining Metronome to share:

 	* How Lovable experiments with pricing [4] to reflect delivered
value
 	* What it takes to evolve from usage-based to outcomes-based pricing
in practice
 	* What's actually working when navigating self-serve and enterprise
monetization

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 THE STATE OF ENTERPRISE AI (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's state of the enterprise AI report shares a comprehensive
look at how enterprises are adopting AI, what workers say they're
gaining, and how organizational leaders are turning experimentation
into measurable productivity and new capabilities. The analysis draws
on real-world usage data from OpenAI's enterprise customers and a
survey of over 9,000 workers across 100 enterprises. It is clear that
enterprise adoption is accelerating in both breadth and depth. The
technology is reshaping how people work, how teams collaborate, and
how organizations build and deliver products. 

 CLAUDE CODE IN SLACK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing devs to run
full coding sessions directly from threads. With workflow automation,
repo context detection, and progress updates, this shift embeds AI
deeper into team collaboration rather than traditional IDEs.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ALIGNMENT IS CAPABILITY (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Alignment research is part of the core research problem. Labs that
treat alignment as a constraint will hit a ceiling, while those that
figure out how to build models that genuinely understand human values
will pull ahead. AGI requires alignment. The integrated approach looks
like the strongest approach. 

 NVIDIA FRENEMY RELATION WITH OPENAI AND ORACLE (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nvidia, OpenAI, and Oracle are all putting pressure on each other. If
Nvidia stopped investing in OpenAI, OpenAI might not have the cash to
sign that deal with Oracle. This might mean that Oracle wouldn't have
the money to buy Nvidia's chips. Some of the companies' reported
revenues might be more fragile than they look. 

 FSDP2 TRAINING (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post explores backend alignment with Megatron, reinforcement
learning improvements, speculative decoding with online SFT, and FP8
precision for scalable model training.

 100 PROMPTS FOR NOTION AGENTS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Not sure how to use Notion Agents? Here are 100 outcome-oriented
examples [10] with “Agent Steps” that show exactly how and what a
Notion Agent will produce. Think dashboards databases, and reports,
all organized by function (analytics, strategy, event planning, CX,
and more). Show me the prompts → [10] 

 ARCHITECTING SECURITY FOR AGENTIC CAPABILITIES IN CHROME (15 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Agentic browsers all face the threat of indirect prompt injection,
which can appear anywhere and cause agents to take unwanted actions.
Google has invested in a layered defense that includes both
deterministic and probabilistic defenses to make it difficult and
costly for attackers to cause harm. It created the user alignment
critic, which vets an agent's actions using a separate model isolated
from untrusted content. It also extended Chrome's origin-isolation
capabilities to constrain what origins the agent can interact with. 

 TRAINING A VLM JUDGE WITHOUT HUMAN LABELS (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new self-supervised framework trains vision-language model judges
without human annotations by generating and filtering multimodal data
through reasoning traces. 

 DEBUGGING MISALIGNED COMPLETIONS WITH SPARSE-AUTOENCODER LATENT
ATTRIBUTION (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI researchers use interpretability tools to address misalignment
in language models by employing sparse-autoencoders and latent
attribution methods. The study introduced an attribution method to
identify SAE latents likely causing certain behaviors, which proved
more effective than activation-based methods in identifying causally
relevant latents.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TRUMP PROMISES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BLOCK STATE AI REGULATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 President Donald Trump said that he will be issuing an executive
order this week to curb state laws on artificial intelligence. All 50
states and territories introduced AI legislation this year. Legal
experts say that the President doesn't have the legal authority to
intervene in state legislation. Eliminating state laws would
effectively remove guardrails for AI. 

 TRUMP GREENLIGHTS NVIDIA H200 AI CHIP SALES TO CHINA IF US GETS 25%
CUT, SAYS XI RESPONDED POSITIVELY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia will be allowed to ship its H200 AI chips to approved
customers in China and elsewhere on the condition that the US gets a
25% cut. The same approach will be applied to AMD, Intel, and other
companies in the US. The policy change is aimed at supporting American
jobs, strengthening US manufacturing, and benefiting American
taxpayers. The Department of Commerce is still finalizing the details
of the policy.
