RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GENERALIZED BIOMOLECULAR MODELING AND DESIGN WITH ROSETTAFOLD
ALL-ATOM (45 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Advances in AI, including AlphaFold, have significantly increased the
rate of progress in science. This study presents RoseTTAFold All-Atom,
a neural network that can model a wide range of molecules beyond
proteins including drugs, vitamins, DNA, and sugars. The authors
validate their architecture by fine-tuning it into a diffusion model
and experimentally validating new-to-nature molecules designed from
minimal prompts across many applications. 

 TRAINING LANGUAGE MODELS ON LOW RESOURCE LANGUAGES (22 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This paper introduces FinGPT, a language model trained on Finnish.
The researchers who created it found that data repetition with some
tricks produced extremely smooth loss curves. This may serve as an
easy fix for underrepresented languages on the internet. 

 A WATERMARKING METHOD FOR PROTECTING VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (14
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 VLPMarker, a new watermarking method, protects Embedding as a Service
Vision-Language Pre-Trained Models from extraction attacks.

 NVIDIA AND MIT RESEARCHERS IMPROVE HOW HARDWARE HANDLES SPARSITY (8
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Sparse tensors occur when some values of the neural network are
zeros. These values can efficiently be skipped. Researchers developed
a way to quickly find when values are zero and overload hardware to
fit more non-zero values onto a chip at a time.
