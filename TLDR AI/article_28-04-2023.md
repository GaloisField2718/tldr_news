PINECONE‚ÄôS $100M SERIES B (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series-b/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Pinecone seems to be one of the go to choices for vector databases.
This is useful when you need a language model to interact with
external data. You embed that data as a vector and store it in a
database like this. One of the key reasons you‚Äôd do this is because
of the context length problem - pinecone says this is ‚Äúextending the
long term memory of language models‚Äù. This certainly is exciting and
many people use pinecone in production. 

ELON MUSK RAMPS UP A.I. EFFORTS, EVEN AS HE WARNS OF DANGERS (10
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/elon-musk-ai-openai.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Elon Musk has cut off OpenAI's access to Twitter data and is
reportedly in talks with University of Toronto professor Jimmy Ba to
create a new AI company called X.AI. This comes amid Musk's growing
disillusionment with OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015. The Tesla
and SpaceX CEO has also hired top AI researchers from Google's
DeepMind at Twitter and discussed creating a ChatGPT rival that
generates politically charged material without restrictions.

LANGUAGE CONTROLLED MEMORY (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13343?utm_source=tldrai] 

SCM is a new system that allows LLMs to process long inputs. It is
composed of three key modules: the language model agent, the memory
stream, and the memory controller. SCM has been shown to be effective
in processing long inputs, and it has the potential to be used for a
variety of tasks. 

SPARSEFORMER: SPARSE VISUAL RECOGNITION VIA LIMITED LATENT TOKENS (12
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03768?utm_source=tldrai] 

SparseFormer, a novel method inspired by human sparse visual
recognition, represents images using a limited number of tokens in the
latent space, achieving competitive performance with lower
computational costs. This approach offers better accuracy-throughput
tradeoffs and can be easily extended to video classification,
potentially inspiring further research on sparse neural architectures.


SHOULD CHATGPT BE BIASED? (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03738?utm_source=tldrai] 

This article examines the challenges and risks of biases in
large-scale language models like ChatGPT, discussing their origins,
ethical concerns, and potential mitigation strategies. It emphasizes
the need for a multidisciplinary, collaborative effort to develop more
equitable, transparent, and responsible AI systems, encouraging
thoughtful dialogue within the AI community about the role of biases
and the pursuit of ethical AI.

LEARNING AGILE SOCCER SKILLS WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (4 MINUTE
READ)
[https://sites.google.com/view/op3-soccer?pli=1?utm_source=tldrai] 

In this study, researchers use Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)
to train a low-cost, miniature humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints
to play a simplified 1v1 soccer game, resulting in the development of
robust and dynamic movement skills and basic strategic understanding.
The combination of high-frequency control, targeted dynamics
randomization, and perturbations during simulation training enabled
successful transfer to real robots, exhibiting improved performance
and agility compared to a scripted baseline. 

TEXTDEFORMER: GEOMETRY MANIPULATION USING TEXT GUIDANCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13348?utm_source=tldrai] 

The study introduces a technique for automatically deforming a
triangle mesh based on a text prompt, leveraging differentiable
rendering and pre-trained image encoders such as CLIP and DINO. By
using Jacobians for mesh deformation representation, the method
achieves smooth deformations and avoids noisy gradients, enabling
large shape changes and fine details while maintaining coherence from
all 3D viewpoints. 

PHOTO-REALISM IN MULTI-VIEW IMAGE GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://ray-cond.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This research focuses on multi-view image generation for 3D-related
applications such as image viewpoint editing. The proposed ray
conditioning method generates multi-view images using a geometry-free
approach, conditioning a 2D GAN on a light field prior, which offers
improved photo-realism, identity consistency, and explicit viewpoint
control while minimizing geometry artifacts and loss of fine-scale
details.
