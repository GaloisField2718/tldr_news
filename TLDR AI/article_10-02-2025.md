HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL LE CHAT (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Blazingly fast new 1,000 words per second chat assistant from
Mistral. It uses Mistral's powerful state-of-the-art coding models and
a lovely canvas to assist in many tasks. 

 PIKA VIDEO EDITING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pika Labs has unveiled Pikadditions, a video-to-video AI tool that
seamlessly integrates objects and characters into videos while
preserving realism. 

 GOOGLE'S AI POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has outlined a policy framework with actionable steps for
policymakers to accelerate scientific discovery using AI that
emphasizes responsible deployment and collaboration in the research
community.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ANALYZE FEATURE FLOW TO ENHANCE INTERPRETATION AND STEERING IN
LANGUAGE MODELS (28 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This paper introduces a novel approach to tracking how features
discovered by sparse autoencoders evolve across consecutive layers of
large language models using a data-free cosine similarity technique
that maps feature persistence, transformation, and emergence. The
paper demonstrates how the resulting cross-layer feature maps enable
direct behavioral control of the models through feature manipulation
while providing mechanistic insights into model computations through
granular flow graphs. 

 SMARTER SEARCH FOR LANGUAGE AGENTS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 QLASS introduces a Q-guided stepwise search method for language
agents that improves decision-making by providing intermediate
rewards. This approach enhances inference efficiency and reduces
reliance on annotated data. 

 FEDERATED LEARNING TO HANDLE NOISY DATA (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FedELC is a two-stage framework designed to enhance federated
learning by addressing the issue of label noise in client datasets.

errors. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEP DIVE INTO LLMS (3 HOUR VIDEO) [14] 

 Andrej Karpathy has released another amazingly educational video that
dives deep into many aspects of developing language models that covers
pre-training, hallucination mitigation, and post training. 

 A DATASET FOR OPEN 3D UNDERSTANDING (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A new object-centric dataset for 3D deep learning and 3D generative
AI. 

 DYNVFX (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Dynamic content insertion into videos. DynVFX achieves strong
performance for a variety of dynamic content inclusion like water and
smoke. It still has a ways to go for more character based content
insertion.
