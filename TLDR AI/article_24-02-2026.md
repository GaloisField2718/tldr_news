 WHAT IF ADDING AUTH TO YOUR APP TOOK ONE COMMAND? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 npx workos launches an AI agent [4], powered by Claude, that reads
your project, detects your framework, and writes a complete auth
integration directly into your existing codebase. It's not a template
generator. It reads your code, understands your stack, and writes an
integration that fits. 

Then it typechecks and builds, feeding any errors back to itself to
fix. Just run npx workos, from WorkOS [5].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC REPORTED LARGE-SCALE DISTILLATION ATTEMPTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Anthropic accused DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax of creating over
24,000 fake accounts to generate roughly 16 million Claude
interactions aimed at replicating its agentic reasoning, tool use, and
coding capabilities. 

 OPENAI PREPARES NEW CHATGPT PRO LITE TIER PRICED AT $100 MONTHLY (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI plans to offer a new subscription tier called ChatGPT Pro
Lite. At $100 per month, the new plan could serve users who hit Plus
rate limits regularly but do not need the unlimited access that Pro
delivers. It could be a way to accommodate Codex usage as well. No
release date has been confirmed yet, and the exact feature set remains
unclear. 

 PERPLEXITY TESTS MESSAGES INTEGRATION AND USAGE CREDITS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Perplexity is testing a Messages connector for its Comet browser,
enhancing local integration with Apple's Messages app. This appeals to
macOS power users by merging communication history with web data. A
new "Usage and Credits" feature allows users to buy additional
credits, addressing backlash from reduced Pro plan limits.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GPT-5 CODEX RAN A 25-HOUR CODING SPRINT (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI described a long-horizon stress test where GPT-5.3-Codex,
given a blank repository and full access, built a design tool over ~25
hours using ~13M tokens and producing ~30k lines of code. 

 SWE-BENCH VERIFIED STOPPED BEING A FRONTIER CODING METRIC (11 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 SWE-bench Verified no longer reliably measures frontier coding
progress because many tasks have flawed tests that rejected correct
fixes and because benchmark contamination has made training exposure a
significant factor in scores. 

 MATHEMATICS IN THE LIBRARY OF BABEL (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Daniel Litt argues that current limitations are real but likely
temporary, not fundamental blockers. Litt now expects AI to
autonomously resolve mildly interesting open conjectures as early as
late 2026 and suggests AI's long-term impact on mathematics may exceed
that of the computer. Even in a future where machines can generate
vast bodies of correct math, he argues human mathematicians will still
matter because the core motivation remains understanding, not just
producing results.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 GIVE ANY AI AGENT ACCESS TO GOOGLE SEARCH WITH SERPAPI (SPONSOR) [13]


 Agents are smarter when they can search the web - but with SerpApi,
you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Build with the same web search
API [13] used by ahrefs, NVIDIA, and Perplexity. Integrate with a
dead-simple GET request that any agent can make. Start with 250 free
credits/month [13] 

 AWS LAUNCHES STRANDS LABS TO GIVE DEVELOPERS A SANDBOX FOR AUTONOMOUS
AI (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AWS Strands Labs is a new GitHub organization aimed at helping
developers explore and experiment with cutting-edge AI techniques. It
is currently available for three specific projects: robots, robots
sim, and AI functions. AWS considers these areas the ones that most
clearly reveal what changes when software becomes agentic. Strands
Labs gives AWS and the broader community a dedicated space to
experiment boldly. 

 THE FIRST FULLY GENERAL COMPUTER ACTION MODEL (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 FDM-1, a foundation model for computer use, efficiently trains on 11
million hours of video to autonomously handle tasks like CAD, driving,
and fuzzing. Unlike traditional models that rely on expensive, limited
annotation, FDM-1 uses a video encoder that compresses 2 hours of
video into 1M tokens and predicts actions with inverse dynamics for
scalable training. With enhanced context processing, FDM-1 showcases
significant advancements in executing long-horizon tasks and exploring
complex state trees in GUI environments. 

 SELF-AWARE REASONING EFFICIENCY (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SAGE introduces a self-aware sampling approach that enables large
reasoning models to decide when to stop thinking, reducing unnecessary
computation. Its companion method, SAGE-RL, distills these efficient
reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, reporting accuracy
improvement with fewer tokens across six challenging math benchmarks. 

 MACHINEAUTH (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 MachineAuth provides secure OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for AI
agents, enabling machine-to-machine authentication. Key features
include JWT token generation, agent management, and scope-based
permissions, all with simple JSON file storage and no databases
required.

 TAALAS HC1: ABSURDLY FAST, PER-USER INFERENCE AT 17,000 TOKENS/SECOND
(5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Taalas has been quietly building a model-on-silicon chip that bakes
an LLM directly into hardware to deliver absurdly fast, per-user
inference. The HC1 chip runs Meta's Llama 3.1 8B at extreme speed by
effectively hardwiring the model into silicon. It delivers inference
at around 17,000 tokens per second per user. This is just the first
version - the next iterations are already geared toward much better
fidelity. 

 OPENAI LANDS MULTIYEAR DEALS WITH CONSULTING GIANTS IN ENTERPRISE
PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI is entering into multiyear partnerships with consulting firms
Accenture, Boston Consulting Group, Capgemini, and McKinsey & Co. to
help deploy its enterprise platform, Frontier. Frontier is an
intelligence layer that stitches together disparate systems and data
within an organization to make it easier for companies to manage,
deploy, and build AI agents. OpenAI decided to partner with the
consulting firms because they have existing relationships with
enterprises and deep knowledge about how those businesses operate.
They will help OpenAI roll out its technology at scale.
