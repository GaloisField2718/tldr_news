HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI DEV DAY 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 There were lots of great announcements at OpenAI's Dev Day 2024, like
vision model fine-tuning, real time API, prompt caching, and model
distillation. 

 PIKA 1.5 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pika has released version 1.5 with more realistic movement, big
screen shots, and Pikaffects. 

 GOV. NEWSOM VETOES CALIFORNIA'S CONTROVERSIAL AI BILL, SB 1047 (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed SB 1047, a bill aimed at regulating
AI development and imposing safety protocols on high-cost models.
Newsom cited concerns that the bill's broad applicability to all
large, computation-heavy models was not the best approach for
effective AI regulation. Despite the veto, Newsom remains committed to
developing AI safeguards, having recently signed multiple related
bills and consulting experts for guidance.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MM1.5 FROM APPLE (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple continues building its in-house capabilities with a strong
multimodal foundation model. 

 THE PERFECT BLEND: REDEFINING RLHF WITH MIXTURE OF JUDGES (21 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Meta has a great new paper about using a mixture of judges models to
properly perform multi task RLHF in post training. It dramatically
improves final performance of the models on a number of benchmarks. 

 HONESTY IN LLMS (36 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This survey examines the honesty of LLMs, a key factor in aligning AI
with human values. It reviews challenges such as models confidently
presenting wrong answers and difficulties in distinguishing known from
unknown knowledge.

 A BENCHMARK FOR LEGAL AI SYSTEMS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 LexEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models
(LLMs) in the legal domain. Given the high demands for accuracy,
reliability, and fairness in legal applications, LexEval aims to help
assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in legal contexts. 

 IMAGE COMPRESSION WITH STABLE DIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 PerCo (SD) is a new perceptual image compression method based on
Stable Diffusion v2.1 aimed at ultra-low bit ranges. 

 CROSS CAPABILITIES IN LLMS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This project highlights the need to evaluate large language models
(LLMs) on their combined abilities, not just individual skills. While
most models are trained on specialized datasets targeting specific
capabilities, real-world tasks often require a blend of expertise
across multiple areas, referred to as cross-capabilities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NVIDIA'S LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL (HUGGING FACE HUB) [14] 

 Nvidia did a really great ablation on different ways to include
images into a language model. It found that the LlaVa concatenation
approach performs the best. 

 AI'S PRIVILEGE EXPANSION (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI is rapidly expanding access to traditionally expensive and
inaccessible services like education, healthcare, and personal
styling. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, provides affordable,
personalized assistance, acting as tutors, healthcare advisors, and
stylists, reducing the reliance on costly human professionals. This
shift democratizes access, making high-end services available to a
wider audience at a fraction of the cost. 

 BEHIND OPENAI'S AUDACIOUS PLAN TO MAKE A.I. FLOW LIKE ELECTRICITY (9
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has proposed a global initiative to build data
centers and chip factories to support advanced AI development. Altman
initially sought trillions but is now targeting hundreds of billions.
The plan involves collaboration with global tech giants and
governments but faces regulatory and logistical challenges. Despite
initial skepticism, discussions continue with potential expansions in
the US, Europe, and Asia to bolster computing power for AI.

 INBOX ZERO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [17] 

 Inbox Zero is an open source AI personal assistant for email. 

 OPENAI TO REMOVE NON-PROFIT CONTROL AND GIVE SAM ALTMAN EQUITY (4
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI plans to restructure into a for-profit benefit corporation to
attract investors - its non-profit will retain a minority stake. 

 DEVS GAINING LITTLE (IF ANYTHING) FROM AI CODING ASSISTANTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 While LLMs can boost productivity, they lack critical thinking and
self-awareness.
