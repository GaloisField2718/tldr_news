 VECTOR DATABASES ARE THE WRONG ABSTRACTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You're building a RAG system, using Pinecone as a vector database to
store and search embeddings.

But your text data doesn't fit well into Pinecone's metadata, so
you're also using DynamoDB. And for lexical search, you need
OpenSearch. Now you're juggling three systems, and syncing them is a
nightmare.

Sound familiar? It's an inherent problem with vector databases [4] -
and the solution might come from thinking about indexes, rather than
vector data types.

Abstraction [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PIXTRAL LARGE (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Pixtral Large is a 124B open-weights multimodal model built on top of
Mistral Large 2. It is the second model in the multimodal family and
demonstrates frontier-level image understanding. The model is able to
understand documents, charts, and natural images while maintaining the
leading text-only understanding of Mistral Large 2. 

 PERPLEXITY INTRODUCES A SHOPPING FEATURE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perplexity has introduced a shopping feature for Pro users in the US,
making it a one-stop solution where you can research and purchase
products. 

 BEN AFFLECK TELLS ACTORS AND WRITERS NOT TO WORRY ABOUT AI (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Ben Affleck reassured Hollywood actors and writers during an
interview that AI poses little threat to their jobs due to its current
limitations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLAVA-O1: REASONING VLMS (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While this is not an actual replication of the process used to train
o1, it is still a strong VLM trained on reasoning traces. 

 CASE STUDY OF SONNET 3.5 COMPUTER USE (40 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This work aims to systematically test the ability of new autonomous
computer use agents. It finds Claude quite powerful at traditional
linear tasks. 

 TEACHING VIDEO MODELS TO UNDERSTAND TIME LIKE A STORY (14 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This paper introduces NumPro, a creative solution that helps Video
Large Language Models handle Video Temporal Grounding tasks.

 BEYOND WORDS: THE NEXT GENERATION OF AI CHATBOTS CAN SEE 👀
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Sendbird's AI chatbot now supports Vision AI [13]. Powered by
multimodal RAG technology, Vision brings a new level of understanding
to conversations. You can now leverage vision language models and
process inputs like images and files. 

Early access is limited. Join the waitlist [12] to be the first to
offer this groundbreaking solution and lead your industry into the
future. Read more here [13].

 LLAMA 3 405B INFERENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cerebras has the largest Llama model, running 12x faster than
comparable systems and 18x faster than some closed model API
providers. It can run at almost 1k tokens per second. It will be
available via API at the beginning of next year. 

 CLIP FOR SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Despite CLIP's success in open-vocabulary tasks, it struggles with
semantic segmentation due to noisy features and limited resolution.
Trident addresses the resolution issue with a training-free framework
that combines CLIP and DINO features from sub-images and uses SAM's
encoder for global feature aggregation. 

 CERTIFIED ROBUSTNESS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 This work focuses on improving the certified robustness of smoothed
classifiers by fine-tuning off-the-shelf models.

 RECAPTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This paper from Google shows how you can change the camera viewpoint
of an existing video. 

 NOUS RESEARCH FORGE (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The Forge Reasoning API allows you to take any popular model and
superpower it with a code interpreter and advanced reasoning
capabilities. This has been shown to increase model performance. 

 WHERE'S MY ROBOT BUTLER? (40 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Advancements in AI and robotics are accelerating the development of
humanoid robots such as Atlas, Optimus, and Neo, robots aimed at
fulfilling domestic tasks akin to Rosie from "The Jetsons." Challenges
persist in creating cost-effective, safe, and efficient actuators. AI
models are crucial for training robots to perform complex tasks
autonomously. Despite progress, these humanoid robots are currently
more suited for industrial settings. They may eventually transition
into home environments if significant breakthroughs occur.
