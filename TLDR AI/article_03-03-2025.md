HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC PARTNERS WITH U.S. NATIONAL LABS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Anthropic has joined the U.S. Department of Energy's 1,000 Scientist
AI Jam, where frontier AI models, including Claude 3.7 Sonnet, will be
tested on scientific and national security challenges. 

 DEEPSEEK RELEASES REVENUE INFORMATION (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepSeek released its inference and revenue numbers at the end of its
open source week. The company offers many services for free - if it
monetized every token, it would make $200m or so in yearly revenue
with healthy margins. 

 INCEPTION EMERGES FROM STEALTH WITH A NEW TYPE OF AI MODEL (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Inception, a Palo Alto startup, has developed a diffusion-based large
language model, DLM, which significantly accelerates AI text
generation compared to traditional LLMs. Founded by Stanford's Stefano
Ermon, the company claims its models are faster, more cost-effective,
and offer up to 10x improved performance. It has secured investment
from Mayfield Fund and attracted several Fortune 100 customers,
offering various deployment options and an API.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ROBUST RLHF WITH PREFERENCE AS REWARD (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A systematic study on reward shaping in RLHF led to Preference As
Reward (PAR), a method that uses latent preferences to enhance
alignment, improve data efficiency, and mitigate reward hacking,
outperforming existing approaches on multiple benchmarks. 

 HVI COLOR SPACE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new color space, Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), along with
the CIDNet model, significantly reduces color artifacts and improves
low-light image enhancement. 

 ENHANCED MULTIMODAL CORRESPONDENCE (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ReCon introduces a dual-alignment learning framework to improve
multimodal correspondence accuracy by enforcing cross-modal and
intra-modal relation consistency.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MOST ADS GET IGNORED—HERE'S WHERE THEY DON'T (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Tech pros scroll past ads all day—but not here. TLDR reaches
millions of devs, founders, and decision makers who actually open,
read, and engage with what's inside. And to make things easier, TLDR's
team writes the ad copy for you, for free. Learn more [10] about
running your first ad campaign. 

 UNDERSTANDING DIFFUSION PLANNING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A large-scale empirical study of diffusion planning in offline
reinforcement learning. 

 MODEL PRE-TRAINING ON LIMITED RESOURCES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Through a benchmark using various academic GPUs, this study
demonstrates that models like Pythia-1B can be pre-trained in far
fewer GPU-days than traditionally required. 

 SPEECH ENHANCEMENT WITH VOICERESTORE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VoiceRestore is an advanced tool for restoring and enhancing speech
recordings using deep learning aimed at improving clarity and removing
noise.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ANTHROPIC USED POKÉMON TO BENCHMARK ITS NEWEST AI MODEL (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Anthropic tested its Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI model by having it play
Pokémon Red, showcasing its "extended thinking" capabilities. The
model successfully battled three gym leaders, significantly
outperforming its predecessor, Claude 3.0 Sonnet. While details on
computing power and time required are unclear, the test highlighted
games as a tool for AI benchmarking. 

 NOTAGEN SHEET MUSIC GENERATION (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 By training an auto-regressive model to generate sheet music, this
team has been able to make a novel text-to-music system that is often
preferred by human raters. 

 PERPLEXITY WANTS TO REINVENT THE WEB BROWSER WITH AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Perplexity has announced its new browser, Comet, which is aimed at
competing with Google's Chrome. No details on its features are
available yet. The company has invited users to sign up for beta
access in a bid to gain early adopters. Perplexity's move indicates a
growing trend of AI-specific applications challenging traditional app
categories.

 WARP LAUNCHES AI-FIRST TERMINAL APP FOR WINDOWS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Sam Altman-backed Warp is reimagining the command-line terminal after
nearly 40 years unchanged. 

 UV AND RAY IN CLUSTERS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Ray now has first-class support for automatic dependence installation
based on Python package management uv. 

 PRIME INTELLECT RAISES $15M (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Prime Intellect, a distributed computing company, has raised
additional funds to continue pushing its distributed training scheme.
