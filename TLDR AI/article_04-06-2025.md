 YOSHUA BENGIO'S AI SAFETY LAB (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Yoshua Bengio launched LawZero, a nonprofit AI safety lab backed by
$30M in funding from major philanthropic donors. 

 GITHUB LAUNCHES COPILOT SPACES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Spaces allows developers to curate code, documentation, and custom
instructions for Copilot, turning it into a subject matter expert that
can be shared across organizations. Files and repositories added to
Spaces automatically stay updated as code changes.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 EFFICIENT ONLINE LEARNING WITH TRL AND VLLM (36 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hugging Face integrated vLLM directly into TRL to reduce
inefficiencies in training with GRPO, an online learning algorithm. 

 MY AI SKEPTIC FRIENDS ARE ALL NUTS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A veteran developer rails against the many highly-skilled programmers
still rejecting LLMs based on experiences with early chatbots, missing
how modern coding agents autonomously navigate codebases, run tests,
and iterate on failures. He dismisses common objections: developers
already review all code before merging regardless of source, and
hallucinations become irrelevant when agents can automatically
compile, catch errors, and retry until tests pass. LLMs might displace
developers but software engineers similarly automated away
administrative roles like travel agents, record store clerks, and
countless other professions. 

 WHY I HAVE SLIGHTLY LONGER TIMELINES THAN SOME OF MY GUESTS (17
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI progress over the last decade has been driven by scaling training
compute of frontier systems. This can't continue beyond this decade.
After 2030, AI progress has to mostly come from algorithmic progress.
However, since the low-hanging fruit will have already been plucked,
the yearly probability of AGI craters.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 DNA REPRESENTATION LEARNING (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SPACE is a supervised learning method for genomic profile prediction
that uses a Mixture of Experts model. 

 DIFFUSION-BASED MEDICAL TREATMENTS (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DIME is a diffusion-based model designed to estimate the joint
distribution of interdependent medical treatment outcomes. 

 JIGSAWSTACK LAUNCHES OPEN-SOURCE DEEP RESEARCH TOOL (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 The framework orchestrates LLMs, recursive web searches, and
structured reasoning to generate reports that would take a human hours
or days to complete. JigsawStack offers control over research depth,
breadth, model selection, and output formatting while maintaining
strong citation transparency.

 VIBE-CODING IDEAS TO GIVE STARTUP GTM TEAMS AN EDGE (10 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 A startup advisor demonstrates building a polished ROI calculator for
a manufacturing SaaS company in under two hours using Bolt.new,
transforming a spreadsheet into an interactive tool that frames value
for executives. Other examples include conference scraping tools,
meeting prep dashboards, and feature prototyping that previously
required engineering teams or expensive agencies but now cost around
$70 in monthly subscriptions, arguing this enables non-technical teams
to prove value and move faster than competitors. 

 WHEN WILL WE PAY A PREMIUM FOR AI LABOR? (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI agents often outperform humans at a fraction of the cost, not yet
commanding premium prices due to ongoing technical evolution and
perceived risk. Waymo, achieving significant safety improvements,
remains cheaper than other options, reflecting a common pricing
strategy across startups. However, in scenarios where AI's constant
vigilance and processing power are crucial, premium pricing might
emerge. 

 PREDICTING AND EXPLAINING AI MODEL PERFORMANCE: A NEW APPROACH TO
EVALUATION (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft researchers developed ADeLe, a framework that predicts and
explains AI model performance on new tasks by assessing them across 18
cognitive and knowledge-based scales. ADeLe uncovered limitations in
current benchmarks and created detailed ability profiles for various
LLMs, highlighting discrepancies in strengths, weaknesses, and
specific abilities. The framework showed an 88% accuracy in predicting
AI success, promising improvements in AI evaluation, policymaking, and
deployments.
