sector applications. 

 NOTES ON DEEPSEEK: GENERATIVE AI IS ALL ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS NOW (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek R1, a new open-source AI model from China, significantly
reduces the cost of running AI models to just 3-5% of OpenAI's
comparable models. This cost reduction shifts focus from
infrastructure investment to actual AI application development,
challenging existing economic models in the AI industry. The
development has the potential to spur new AI products but also raises
concerns about adequate generative AI applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 YUE MUSIC MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [7] 

 The YuE model is a full song generation model that generates lyrics
and music together. It is quite high fidelity and easily the best open
source model to date. YuE is not quite as strong as the closed models,
but is still quite compelling. It uses a two stage approach and uses
discrete audio tokens. 

 A ROBUST SLAM SYSTEM (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LCP-Fusion introduces a new approach to dense SLAM that addresses
challenges in mapping unknown environments with high accuracy. 

 PING PONG GEMM KERNEL FROM CUTLASS (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A pretty technical deep dive into lightning-fast multiplication
kernels for hardware accelerators. Specifically, the Ping Pong
asynchronous kernel, which works for fp8 and has extremely strong
final performance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 RESEARCHERS USE AI TO DESIGN PROTEINS THAT BLOCK SNAKE VENOM TOXINS
(7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers used AI tools like RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN to design
proteins that inhibit snake venom toxins, showing potential for
antivenoms that don't need refrigeration. They successfully created a
protein that inhibits neurotoxic venom but faced challenges with
toxins disrupting cell membranes. This showcases AI's power to solve
complex biological problems that were previously difficult to tackle.
