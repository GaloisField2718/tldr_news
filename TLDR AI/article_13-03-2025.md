 CASE STUDY: OPEN SOURCE MODEL TRAINING WITH 1000+ NVIDIA HOPPER GPUS
AND CIRRASCALE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Ai2 is a nonprofit research institute dedicated to developing truly
open AI solutions to solve the world's biggest problems. To continue
innovating, they needed to scale compute performance and prepare a
data center with significant room for growth.

Read the case study [4] to learn how Cirrascale Cloud Services helped
them create custom, highly performant AI infrastructure [4] that
delivered:

⚡Best in class setup for their NVIDIA Hopper GPU cluster with NVIDIA
Quantum-2 InfiniBand.

⚡ Dramatic increase in compute performance.

⚡ Custom and scalable setup.

⚡ Increased reliability and business continuity.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TRANSFORMING GAME ASSET CREATION WITH GENIES' AIGC-POWERED SYSTEM -
GENIES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Game Art Forge introduces AI-generated templates to streamline game
asset creation, enhancing speed, scalability, and creative control for
developers. It allows customization while maintaining consistency and
supports both indie developers and larger teams. By combining AI
efficiency with human creativity, it ensures high-quality, adaptable
workflows for game development. 

 AI SCIENTIST'S FIRST PUBLICATION (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The AI scientist from Sakana Labs has its first reviewed and accepted
publication. It generated the idea, conducted experiments, and wrote a
novel paper that was accepted to an ICLR workshop (with the full
consent of the conference organizers). 

 GOOGLE'S NEW OPEN WEIGHTS MODEL (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has released the weights and a technical report for the Gemma
3 model. This model, which comes in four sizes, is approximately as
performant as Gemini 1.5 Pro. It also has a strong understanding of
140+ languages. It seems to be close to the state-of-the-art dense
model. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GEMMA 3 TECHNICAL REPORT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has released the best dense models available. They score 9th
in the arena, have phenomenal multilingual capabilities, and support
more than 140 languages. Depending on the upcoming open launches,
these may be the backbone of the community. They certainly are the
best single GPU models and likely will be for some time. 

 PREDICTING FUTURE FEATURES IN DIFFUSION MODELS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TaylorSeer introduces a method to predict future timestep features in
diffusion models using Taylor series expansion, significantly reducing
errors in feature caching. 

 SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH TOKEN AGGREGATION (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CATANet enhances image super-resolution by aggregating long-range
content-similar tokens. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LM-IMPLICIT-REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This project explores how language models perform stepwise implicit
reasoning but struggle with generalization, especially when dealing
with expressions containing variables as subtrahends. 

 MULTIMODAL MOTION GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Motion Anything improves conditional motion generation by introducing
Attention-based Mask Modeling for better spatial and temporal control.


 DUAL-STREAM VIDEO INPAINTING (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 VideoPainter introduces a dual-stream architecture for video
inpainting, significantly reducing learning complexity while improving
background preservation and object generation. It also provides VPData
and VPBench, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to
date. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 PROMPTPEX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 PromptPex is a developer tool that treats prompts as functions and
automatically generates test inputs, enabling systematic unit testing
of AI model prompts. 

 INDUCTIVE MOMENT MATCHING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A nice unification and simplification of diffusion models for
continuous data. They use a new moment matching framework to create a
few step generative model. 

 OPENR1 UPDATE 3 (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Hugging Face team has announced the next update for its open
replication of the DeepSeek reasoning model. It found that small
models can outperform the larger ones when tuned specifically for
competitive coding.

QUICK LINKS

 🩻 BUILDING AN AI PLATFORM IN HEALTHCARE (SPONSOR) [17] 

 Oxford Languages hosted Yasmin Greenaway, founder of Dermie.AI [18],
for a discussion of AI in healthcare - from data privacy to the latest
vision algorithms used for model training. Watch the recording [17] 

 ROTATE LORA FOR WAN (HUGGING FACE HUB) [19] 

 Wan is a generative image model that has recently been open sourced. 

 FLAT COLOR LORA (HUGGING FACE HUB) [20] 

 Another LoRA for the Wan video model. 

 SMALL REASONING MODELS WITH TWO-STAGE RULE-BASED RL (6 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 By breaking the reasoning training process into two steps, this work
shows that small models are still able to generalize across tasks and
even modalities.
