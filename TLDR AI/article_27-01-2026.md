 WATCH ATLASSIAN'S ROVO AI PLAN A FULL PRODUCT LAUNCH PLAN IN MINUTES
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most product launches start the same way: a blank page and a
deadline.

Atlassian's new Rovo AI [4] changes that. In this live webinar [4],
the Confluence product team demonstrates how to go from rough idea to
complete GTM plan using AI-assisted drafting — then connect it all
to Jira for tracking and Loom for async feedback loops.

Don't miss this practical look into how AI fits into the launch
workflow, from first draft to cross-functional coordination. Save your
spot → [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC INTEGRATES INTERACTIVE MCP APPS INTO CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Anthropic has introduced MCP app integration into Claude's AI
assistant, enabling seamless use of tools like Asana, Slack, Figma,
and Box within its interface. This update enhances real-time
interaction, setting Claude apart by embedding live app experiences
directly into chats, boosting workflow efficiency. The move supports
open standards and encourages developer-created integrations, aligning
with Anthropic's ecosystem goals. 

 QWEN3-MAX-THINKING DEBUTS WITH FOCUS ON HARD MATH, CODE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Qwen3-Max-Thinking is a reasoning model for complex math, coding, and
multi-step workflows. Available on Alibaba Cloud's Model Studio, this
model excels in tasks that require evidence gathering and deep
verification, offering adaptive tool-use and built-in web search
features. Early testers highlight its benefits for developers and
enterprises needing long-context reasoning and tool-using agents. 

 THE ADOLESCENCE OF TECHNOLOGY (96 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dario Amodei argues that as AI approaches the capability of a
"country of geniuses," humanity faces critical challenges in safety,
misuse, and economic disruption. He highlights the risks of allowing
powerful AI to concentrate in authoritarian regimes, potentially
leading to irreversible totalitarian control or unprecedented
destructive capability in the wrong hands. Amodei advocates for
strategic controls and regulations to align AI development with
democratic principles, emphasizing the urgent need for informed global
cooperation to prevent catastrophic outcomes. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 REALTIME EVALS FOR VOICE SYSTEMS (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A three-phase approach to building robust evaluation workflows for
voice systems, helping teams move from demos to production by
structuring datasets, grading mechanisms, and feedback loops. 

 WHO WINS THE AI RACE? (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Model benchmarks matter less than compute access, infrastructure
scale, and long-term demand for intelligence. The race is not
zero-sum, and all major labs will become massive as AI adoption,
enterprise agents, and compute needs grow exponentially. 

 THE BROWSER IS THE SANDBOX (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Co-do showcases how browsers can act as sandboxes for running
AI-powered applications safely. It utilizes layered sandboxing by
restricting file system access with the File System Access API,
controlling network requests via strict CSP policies, and running code
in isolated WebAssembly environments. This approach highlights the
potential for browsers to serve as secure execution environments for
untrusted code, but reveals gaps like dependency on LLM providers and
the limitations of current browser security features.

 CHATGPT CONTAINERS CAN NOW RUN BASH, PIP/NPM INSTALL PACKAGES, AND
DOWNLOAD FILES (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 ChatGPT Code Interpreter underwent a massive upgrade in the past few
months. It can write and then test code in 11 new languages, find
files online and download them into a container, and install packages
via pip and npm to help it solve problems. There is no official
documentation for these new features. This post provides an overview
of the update, along with a full list of tools that ChatGPT now has
access to. 

 SELF-ADAPTIVE CONTEXT PRUNING FOR CODING AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SWE-Pruner introduces a task-aware context pruning framework that
cuts token usage in code agents by over 50% without harming
performance. It dynamically selects relevant code using a lightweight
model, optimizing workflows in multi-turn engineering tasks. 

 ENDLESS TERMINALS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Endless Terminals provides an automated pipeline to generate
realistic terminal tasks without human labeling, enabling scalable
reinforcement learning for terminal-based agents. 

 RUBRIC-GUIDED SELF-EVOLUTION (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DeepVerifier is a test-time verifier that improves deep research
agents by applying rubric-based feedback during inference.

 AN AI PIONEER WARNS THE TECH ‘HERD' IS MARCHING INTO A DEAD END (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Yann LeCun, one of the world's leading experts on artificial
intelligence, has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of
Silicon Valley's approach to building AI. He says the technology
industry will eventually hit a dead end in its AI development as LLM
technology has its limits. The herd effect in Silicon Valley leaves no
room for other approaches that may be more promising in the long run.
If everyone were open, the field as a whole would progress faster. 

 MAIA 200: THE AI ACCELERATOR BUILT FOR INFERENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Maia 200 is an inference accelerator engineered to dramatically
improve the economics of AI token generation. It is the most
performant first-party silicon from any hyperscaler, with three times
the FP4 performance of the third-generation Amazon Trainium. The chip
will serve multiple models, including the latest GPT-5.2 models from
OpenAI. It is being deployed in Microsoft's US Central data region
near Des Moines, Iowa, with the US West 3 datacenter region near
Phoenix, Arizona, coming next, and future regions to follow.
