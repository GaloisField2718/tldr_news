HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 BREAKING: ADVANCED CODE EDITOR IS COMING TO XAI'S GROK! (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 xAI's Grok is getting an advanced code editor that lets users run
code inside Grok. Users can talk to it and ask it to modify code or
debug it for them. A screenshot of the new feature is available on the
post. 

 INTRODUCING GEMMA 3N: THE DEVELOPER GUIDE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google recently released an extremely consequential new open weights
model that is multimodal by design and optimized for on-device. Gemma
3n accepts text, images, and audio as inputs. Google partnered with
AMD, Axolotl, Docker, Hugging Face, llama.cpp, LMStudio, MLX, NVIDIA,
Ollama, RedHat, SGLang, Unsloth, and vLLM for the launch, so there are
dozens of ways to try out the model. This post presents a quick
walkthrough on how to set up and use the model on macOS. 

 META REPORTEDLY RECRUITS OPENAI REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PIONEER (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While the move has not been formally confirmed by Meta yet, reports
indicate that Meta has hired Trapit Bansal for its new AI
superintelligence unit, potentially boosting its push for a frontier
reasoning model.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ANTHROPIC STUDY REVEALS EMOTIONAL AI USE IS RARER THAN EXPECTED (12
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anonymized analysis of 4.5 million conversations reveals only 2.9%
involve emotional support and that people's sentiment consistently
improves during interactions. Claude disagrees with users less than
10% of the time, primarily for safety reasons, as users explore topics
ranging from workplace stress to existential philosophy to romantic
relationships. 

 A GUIDE FOR LLM-ASSISTED WEB RESEARCH (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article provides strategies for using LLMs to enhance web
research efficiency and accuracy. Key techniques include refining
prompts and leveraging LLMs for summarization.

 REPORT: AI IS DRIVING HIGHER CONVERSION RATES FOR ECOMMERCE BY MAKING
SHOPPING MORE CONVERSATIONAL (SPONSOR) [12] 

 A new survey by Bloomreach reveals that shoppers now expect natural,
conversational search experiences ‚Äî and they're voting with their
wallets. Sites with conversational AI see 33% higher revenue per visit
[12], with 93% of consumers saying this is an important part of their
buying experience. Download the full report [12] to see how leading
brands are adapting. 

 TWO NEW ADDITIONS TO THE OPENAI API (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI recently added Deep Research and Webhooks to its API. The
models are the same post-trained o3 and o4-mini models that power deep
research in ChatGPT. They support MCP and Code Interpreter. Webhooks
allow developers to receive notifications for certain API events, such
as completed responses, fine-tuning jobs, and batch jobs. Links to
guides on how to get started with the new features are available in
the post. 

 FLUX.1 KONTEXT [DEV] - OPEN WEIGHTS FOR IMAGE EDITING (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 FLUX.1 Kontext [dev] is a 12B parameter model that can run on
consumer hardware that delivers proprietary-level image editing
performance. It is available as an open-weight model under the FLUX.1
Non-Commercial License, which provides free access for research and
non-commercial use. The model is compatible with the existing FLUX.1
[dev] inference code and comes with day-0 support for popular
inference frameworks like ComfyUI, Hugging Face Diffusers, and
TensorRT. 

 TRANSFORMERS WITHOUT NORMALIZATION (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Meta's FAIR team demonstrated that Transformers can match performance
without normalization layers by replacing them with Dynamic Tanh
(DyT), a simple element-wise operation that mimics the S-shaped curves
naturally produced by layer normalization. This challenges a decade of
neural network orthodoxy and could trigger a wave of architectural
simplification across AI systems, potentially making models easier to
deploy and optimize for specialized hardware.

 AI DISRUPTOR DEEPSEEK'S NEXT-GEN MODEL DELAYED BY NVIDIA GPU EXPORT
RESTRICTIONS TO CHINA ‚Äî SHORT SUPPLY OF AI GPUS HINDERS DEVELOPMENT
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DeepSeek used a cluster consisting of 50,000 Hopper GPUs to train its
R1 model. It is unclear whether R2 has already been fully pre-trained,
but reports say that DeepSeek's CEO still isn't yet satisfied with its
capabilities. The restriction of Nvidia shipments is limiting how R1
is used today and making it harder for DeepSeek to get ready for the
launch of R2. While the company claims to have developed its models
using far fewer resources than US companies, the recent export curbs
highlight how China's top AI companies remain heavily dependent on US
hardware. 

 WHY A16Z VC BELIEVES THAT CLUELY, THE ‚ÄòCHEAT ON EVERYTHING'
STARTUP, IS THE NEW BLUEPRINT FOR AI STARTUPS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cluely, a startup backed by a16z, uses controversial marketing to
attract attention and quickly convert it into paying customers,
aligning with a16z's view that speed and momentum are crucial for AI
startup success. Partner Bryan Kim believes Cluely's strategy embodies
the concept of "momentum as a moat," emphasizing the rapid adaptation
necessary in the evolving AI landscape. Cluely's upcoming product
launch will test whether this approach proves effective.
