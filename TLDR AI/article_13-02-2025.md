HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 HARVEY RAISES $300M SERIES D (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The legal AI startup Harvey raised a substantial sum in a funding
round led by Sequoia to continue building tools for law firms. 

 APPLE EXPLORING HUMANOID ROBOTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is in the early proof-of-concept stage for both humanoid and
non-humanoid robots, with potential mass production not expected until
2028 or later. 

 OPENAI'S ROADMAP FOR GPT-5 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5 as its last non-chain-of-thought
model before launching GPT-5, which will unify its o-series and
GPT-series models. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPSCALER: SURPASSING O1-PREVIEW WITH A 1.5B MODEL BY SCALING RL (14
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Most of the research that makes such dramatic claims is easily
falsifiable. This is a unique work in that the methods are quite
sound. One cool finding the researchers made is that by gradually
increasing the context length during RL training, they could smoothly
improve AIME performance without wasting compute. 

 COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING WITH LARGE REASONING MODELS (25 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 OpenAI paper about using their o series of reasoning models in
competitive programming. They find that originally they had to use
hand crafted inference strategies, but later versions of o3 scored
well without human intervention. 

 100 BILLION IMAGES FOR VLM PRE-TRAINING (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepMind scaled vision language model training to a substantially
higher data scale than was previously attempted. Western-centric tasks
saturate quickly. However, performance on diverse global tasks
continues to improve. Interestingly, this improvement is rarely
captured by existing benchmarks. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ESM2 IN EQUINOX (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 ESM2 is a great protein folding model. This is a well-maintained
version in a popular Jax package. 

 DATA FORMULATOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A great little tool from Microsoft that uses language models to
create charts and answer questions about datasets. It unfortunately
doesn't support local models, but works well with an API key. 

 PAGE ASSIST (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 One of many new tools for web browsing with local language models. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE EXPANDS AI-POWERED DEMAND GEN FEATURES (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google has introduced new enhancements to Demand Gen campaigns,
including advanced customization options, AI-driven creative
improvements, and richer product details to improve ad performance
across visual-first platforms like YouTube. 

 AI KEEPS ITS OWN TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SiTime's MEMS-based timekeeping device enhances AI efficiency by
improving synchronization across multiple components, offering
significant energy savings. The Super-TCXO clock provides superior
synchronization compared to quartz components, aiding in faster
bandwidth and reduced idle times for GPUs. SiTime's technology is
already integrated into Nvidia's Spectrum-X Switch, with plans for
future advancements in energy efficiency and bandwidth. 

 AI ‘GODFATHER' PREDICTS ANOTHER REVOLUTION IN THE TECH IN NEXT FIVE
YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Yann LeCun predicts a new AI revolution within five years,
emphasizing current AI's limitations in understanding the physical
world for applications like autonomous cars. LeCun and other AI
pioneers received the Queen Elizabeth prize for their work in machine
learning. Fellow winner Yoshua Bengio stresses the need for addressing
AI safety risks at the upcoming global AI summit.

QUICK LINKS

 DEEPSEEK: THE COUNTRIES AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE BANNED THE AI
COMPANY'S TECH (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DeepSeek, a Chinese AI firm, faces bans from multiple countries and
organizations due to privacy and security concerns linked to data
sharing with the Chinese government. 

 GOOGLE REMOVES PLEDGE TO NOT USE AI FOR WEAPONS FROM WEBSITE (1
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google removed its pledge against developing AI for weapons or
surveillance from its website. 

 FIGURE DROPS OPENAI IN FAVOR OF IN-HOUSE MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Figure AI has ended its collaboration with OpenAI to focus on
developing in-house AI for humanoid robots.
