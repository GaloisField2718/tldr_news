 INTRODUCING TLMS: TASK-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE MODELS THAT OUTPERFORM LLMS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 It doesn't really make sense to run a massive inference model for
every small task. That's why Fastino is introducing TLMs [4] -
task-specific Language Models that are better, faster, and cheaper.

For defined tasks — such as summarization, function calling, and
creative writing — TLMs are:

→ 99x faster than OpenAI [4]

→ 17% more accurate in task-specific benchmarks

→ Able to respond in <100ms for real-time applications

And because these models are small, they don't need to burn through
GPUs - so you can pay just a single flat fee.

development. Join the waitlist [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE'S "JULES" ENTERS AI CODING RACE WITH AUTONOMOUS AGENT APPROACH
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 After launching a private beta in December, Google has released Jules
to the public. The Gemini 2.5-powered tool clones entire repositories,
then autonomously writes tests, fixes bugs, and builds features while
developers work elsewhere. The agentic coding landscape is divided
between synchronous pair-programming assistants and fully independent
agents like Devin and Jules. 

 EXCLUSIVE: GOOGLE SEES SMART GLASSES AS THE 'NEXT FRONTIER' FOR AI.
AND IT'S NOT WORKING ALONE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is reentering the smart glasses space with Android XR,
integrating its Gemini AI to deliver real-time vision analysis,
translation, and contextual assistance through AR glasses. The rollout
will begin with Project Moohan, a mixed-reality headset built with
Samsung, and followed by Project Aura, a developer-focused AR glasses
prototype from Xreal, and future consumer AI glasses from partners
like Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. 

 ‘DEEP THINK' BOOSTS THE PERFORMANCE OF GOOGLE'S FLAGSHIP GOOGLE
GEMINI AI MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's Deep Think is an enhanced reasoning mode for the company's
flagship Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It can consider multiple answers to
questions before responding. Deep Think enabled Gemini 2.5 to top
LifeCodeBench, a challenging coding evaluation, and it also beat
OpenAI's o3 on MMMU, a test for skills like perception and reasoning.
Google will be testing Deep Think with 'trusted testers' and
conducting safety evaluations before rolling out the feature widely. 

 APPLE WILL REPORTEDLY OPEN UP ITS LOCAL AI MODELS TO THIRD-PARTY APPS
(1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple plans to open up its large language models via a software
development kit (SDK) so developers can use them in their own apps.
The SDK will initially only run Apple's smaller on-device models and
won't allow developers to access the models running in the cloud. It
will likely be announced during the Worldwide Developers Conference
event scheduled to start on June 9. The event will also include an
announcement for an overhaul of iOS, macOS, and iPadOS that will make
them more unified and resemble the Vision Pro operating system.

 POE REPORT SHOWS RAPID SHIFTS IN AI MODEL MARKET SHARE (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A report from Quora's multi-model chat platform Poe revealed dramatic
shifts in AI model usage from January to May 2025, with OpenAI's
GPT-4.1 family and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro quickly gaining popularity
while Anthropic's Claude models declined. The report highlights clear
leaders across categories: general text is dominated by GPT-4.1,
reasoning capabilities are led by Gemini 2.5 Pro, image generation is
led by Google's Imagen3, and video creation is more split, with Runway
currently leading.

MINUTE READ) [13] 

 François Chollet and the ARC Prize team have released ARC-AGI-2, a
significantly more challenging version of their abstract reasoning
benchmark. Initial testing shows even the most advanced AI systems
struggling, with o3 scoring just 3% compared to 53% on the original
benchmark, while human participants successfully solved 75% of tasks
on average. The ARC Prize 2025 competition offers $1 million in
prizes, including a $700,000 grand prize for the first team to achieve
85% accuracy.
