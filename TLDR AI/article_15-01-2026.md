and cost across Character.ai's systems and doubled production
inference speed. 

 UNDERSTANDING MANUS SANDBOX - YOUR CLOUD COMPUTER (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Manus Sandbox is a fully isolated cloud virtual machine that runs in
its own environment. Manus allocates a sandbox for each task and can
execute sandboxes in parallel. Sandboxes have full capabilities,
including networking, file systems, a browser, and various software
tools. They can work around the clock to complete assigned tasks
without consuming local resources. 

 SOFTWARE TOO CHEAP TO METER (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI coding agents are making software development nearly free,
allowing for personalized applications tailored to individual needs.
These agents, like Anthropic's Claude Code, can automate small
projects that save time. While the technology is still developing, it
promises rapid changes in software customization and productivity by
2026.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 HOW SHOPIFY AND GOOGLE BUILT THE UNIVERSAL COMMERCE PROTOCOL (UCP) SO
AI AGENTS CAN TRANSACT WITH ANY MERCHANT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Shopify and Google co-developed an open standard for AI agents: the
Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) [12]. UCP defines the discovery and
negotiation mechanisms between agent and merchant, and makes it simple
for humans and agents to work together. Read more on the Shopify
Engineering Blog [12] 

 GPT-5.2-CODEX IS NOW AVAILABLE IN THE RESPONSES API (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 GPT-5.2-Codex is an upgraded version of GPT-5.2 optimized for agentic
coding tasks in Codex and similar environments. It supports four
levels of reasoning effort settings and has a 400,000-token context
window. The model costs $1.75 per million input tokens and $14.00 per
million output tokens. It is now available in the Responses API. 

 TOOL SEARCH NOW IN CLAUDE CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MCP Tool Search is now rolling out in Claude Code. The feature allows
Claude Code to dynamically load tools into context. Claude Code
detects when MCP tool descriptions would use more than 10% of the
context, and when triggered, tools are loaded via search instead of
preloaded. MCP tools will otherwise work exactly as before. 

 MINISTRAL 3 TECHNICAL REPORT (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ministral 3 is a new family of dense language models (3B, 8B, and
14B) optimized for low-resource environments, offering base,
instruction-tuned, and reasoning variants. The models support image
understanding and were trained using Cascade Distillation, an
iterative distillation and pruning method.

 OPENAI'S HIDDEN CHATGPT TRANSLATE TOOL TAKES ON GOOGLE TRANSLATE (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI is quietly rolling out a feature called ChatGPT Translate that
looks very similar to Google Translate. It is unclear which model
OpenAI is using for the feature. ChatGPT Translate is free to use and
doesn't require a paid account. Users can keep the conversation going
after the first translation. A screenshot of the feature is available
in the article. 

 ANTHROPIC IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic blocked opencode from the Claude Code API, causing
frustration among users and encouraging them to switch models. This
decision risks driving users to other providers by showcasing
hostility against users who don't comply with strict usage policies.
Blocking opencode is seen as a first step in enforcing rigid control,
potentially alienating its user base. 

 AI'S WAY COOLER TRILLION-DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY: VIBE GRAPHS (7 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The emerging trillion-dollar opportunity lies in developing "vibes
graphs" capturing ambient organizational sentiment. Current enterprise
software tracks structured data but misses the nuanced vibes that
influence decisions, leading to potential monetary losses. Startups
building vibes-native infrastructure are poised to create competitive
advantages over incumbents by capturing real-time emotional cues,
unlocking deep insights into organizational dynamics.
