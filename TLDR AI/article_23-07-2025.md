 📈 AI IS ELEVATING HR'S ROLE IN ENTERPRISE TECH STRATEGY (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 New data from Sapient Insights reveals a shift: HR isn't just
supporting tech strategy—it's driving it. HR leaders are steering
governance, ethics, and tech alignment across talent, performance, and
feedback systems—especially as AI reshapes the HR tech landscape.

This exclusive webinar [4] breaks down where HR must lead next: 
– AI's impact across core HR tech 
– How enterprise buyers are shifting 
– The new role HR plays in ethics, strategy, and spend

If you influence workforce strategy, tech decisions, or AI
adoption—don't miss this [4].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC TESTS MEMORY AND MCP SUPPORT FOR CLAUDE MOBILE APP (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic is preparing a memory and recall capability upgrade to
Claude's mobile experience. The feature will enable Claude to retain
information across sessions and reference earlier conversations.
Claude on the web doesn't have this feature yet - its presence in the
iOS code hints at a potential cross-platform rollout in the future. 

 OPENAI AGREED TO PAY ORACLE $30B A YEAR FOR DATA CENTER SERVICES (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI will pay Oracle $30 billion annually for data center services,
focusing on the 4.5 gigawatts Stargate project. This deal triples
OpenAI's current annual revenue of $10 billion. The construction of
this extensive data center in Texas poses cost and energy challenges. 

 ANTHROPIC RESEARCHERS DISCOVER THE WEIRD AI PROBLEM: WHY THINKING
LONGER MAKES MODELS DUMBER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic researchers revealed that AI models often perform worse
with extended reasoning time, challenging the assumption that more
processing improves outcomes. Key findings show models like Claude and
OpenAI's series struggle with distraction or overfitting when given
more time on tasks, leading to accuracy declines. 

 QWEN3-CODER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The 480B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among open
models on coding tasks and claims to match Sonnet 4. Alibaba also
open-sourced Qwen Code, a command-line tool adapted from Google's
Gemini Code, and made the model compatible with Claude Code.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ON "CHATGPT PSYCHOSIS" AND LLM SYCOPHANCY (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Overly agreeable AI models are fueling user delusions and spiritual
fantasies, from OpenAI pulling a dangerously flattering GPT-4o
checkpoint to viral cases like "Bob" being manipulated by a ChatGPT
persona. The root cause appears structural — RLHF training creates
sycophantic models that validate beliefs without pushback, and memory
features trap users in escalating delusions across conversations. 

 AI MARKET CLARITY (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI markets have crystallized with clear leaders in LLMs (Anthropic,
Google, Meta, xAI, and OpenAI) and sectors like Legal (Harvey and
CaseText) and Code (Microsoft/GitHub and OpenAI). Future markets ripe
for AI disruption include Accounting, Compliance, Financial Tools,
Sales Tooling, and Security. The shift is moving towards agentic
workflows, expanding AI's role from informational tools to performing
actions, while market consolidation via M&A and strategic partnerships
is expected to intensify. 

 ARC-AGI-3 (WEBSITE) [11] 

 ARC-AGI-3 is the first eval that measures human-like intelligence in
AI. It is designed to measure AI system generalization and
intelligence through skill-acquisition efficiency in novel, unseen
environments. ARC-AGI-3 leverages game environments to provide a rich
medium for testing experience-driven competence. The benchmark is
still in development and is set to launch in 2026.

 🔍 WHAT IF SPECIALIZED LLMS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER FOR DEVELOPERS?
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 General-purpose LLMs are here to stay, but they're no longer the
whole story.

Join JetBrains and Hugging Face for a livestream on Mellum [13]: a
task-specific LLM working with general models to improve developer
tools.

 GEMINI 2.5 FLASH-LITE IS NOW STABLE AND GENERALLY AVAILABLE (1 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite has joined Pro and Flash in General
Availability. It is the cheapest of the 2.5 family, at $0.10/million
input tokens and $0.40/million output tokens. Audio input pricing has
been reduced by 40% from the preview launch. 

 HIERARCHICAL REASONING MODEL, A BRAIN-INSPIRED ARCHITECTURE (GITHUB
REPO) [15] 

 Sapient Intelligence's 27-million-parameter Hierarchical Reasoning
Model beats OpenAI's o3-mini, DeepSeek R1, and Claude on complex
reasoning benchmarks using just 1,000 training examples and no
pre-training. The brain-inspired architecture alternates between fast
"System 1" and deliberate "System 2" thinking in a single forward
pass, suggesting that architectural innovation — not just scale —
could advance AI reasoning capabilities. 

 COMPRESSING CONTEXT (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Extended agentic workflows face a fundamental challenge: how to
handle tasks that exceed limited context windows. A new approach uses
"anchored summaries" that update incrementally rather than
re-summarizing entire conversations, preserving critical details like
session intent and file modification trails. The technique points
toward "proactive memory management" systems where agents
intelligently decide when to compress information rather than hitting
arbitrary token limits.

 OPENAI TESTS CLINICAL AI COPILOT WITH PENDA HEALTH (13 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 OpenAI partnered with Penda Health in Kenya to evaluate AI Consult, a
GPT-4o-powered clinical copilot. In a study of nearly 40,000 visits,
clinicians using the tool saw 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13%
fewer treatment errors. 

 IN LEAKED MEMO, ANTHROPIC CEO SAYS COMPANY WILL PURSUE GULF STATE
INVESTMENTS AFTER ALL (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Dario Amodei acknowledged that allowing Middle East leaders to invest
in Anthropic would likely enrich "dictators" but argued that "no bad
person should ever benefit from our success" is a difficult operating
principle. The shift marks Anthropic's attempt to stay competitive
with rivals, like OpenAI, which is building data centers in the UAE as
part of the Stargate project, while maintaining its safety-first
principles. 

 MICROSOFT POACHES 20 TOP AI ENGINEERS FROM GOOGLE'S DEEPMIND,
INCLUDING HEAD OF GEMINI CHATBOT (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft poached more than 20 employees from Google DeepMind,
including Amar Subramanya, the former head of engineering for Google's
Gemini chatbot. Subramanya has joined Microsoft as a corporate
vice-president of AI. The aggressive recruitment drive underscores
Microsoft's strategy to gain a competitive edge by acquiring critical
talent. It appears to be largely orchestrated by Microsoft's consumer
AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, who was one of DeepMind's co-founders.
