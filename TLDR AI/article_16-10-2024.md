 MITIGATING AI RISKS: A GOVERNANCE STRATEGY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NEW
THREATS, AND NEW REGULATIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Current governance processes are a poor fit for AI and data science.
They waste resources, delay initiatives and leave too much residual
risk. A new strategy is needed.

JOIN THE WEBINAR NEXT TUESDAY [4] (October 22nd) to learn about
identifying threats, governance strategies, and evolving AI
regulations.

As part of the webinar, the Domino team will also discuss
recently-announced additional governance capabilities, Domino
Governance [5]. These allow you to define policies from scratch or
templates, capture/review evidence, and get a global view of policies
and compliance.

Learn how you can shorten the time to comply with new policies _from
months to weeks_. Register for the live session. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META'S OPEN AI HARDWARE VISION (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta showcased open AI hardware designs, including the Catalina rack
and the expanded Grand Teton platform, at the OCP Global Summit.
Training the Llama 3.1 405B model required 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs,
highlighting Meta's scaling infrastructure. Open AI hardware systems
are required to continue advancing AI capabilities. 

 THE NEW YORK TIMES WARNS AI SEARCH ENGINE PERPLEXITY TO STOP USING
ITS CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The New York Times has issued a cease and desist to AI startup
Perplexity, accusing it of using its content without permission for AI
search operations. Perplexity claims it doesn't scrape content for
training but indexes web pages to surface factual content. The company
is engaging with publishers and aims to resolve the issue by working
with the Times and other media outlets. 

 DECAGON RAISES $65M SERIES B (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Decagon has raised $65 million in Series B funding to enhance its AI
customer support agents, which are already used by companies like
Duolingo and Eventbrite to efficiently manage customer interactions.
Its AI agents automate repetitive tasks, enabling customer support
teams to focus on higher-value roles. The funding will bolster
Decagon's engineering team and expand its AI solutions into new
markets and verticals.

PDFs. 

 ENHANCED IMAGE GENERATION EFFICIENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 HART is a new visual generation model that creates high-quality
1024x1024 images, challenging the capabilities of diffusion models. It
improves image reconstruction and lowers training costs by using a
hybrid tokenizer that combines discrete and continuous tokens. 

 A NEW VISION TRANSFORMER WITH ENHANCED ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention (DBRA) module was developed
to improve attention mechanisms in vision transformers. DeBiFormer,
built on DBRA, optimizes the selection of key-value pairs and improves
query interpretability in attention maps.

 NEW HIGH QUALITY AI VIDEO GENERATOR PYRAMID FLOW LAUNCHES (7 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Pyramid Flow is a new open-source AI video generator that creates
high-quality videos using a pyramidal flow matching technique,
optimizing computational efficiency. It competes with proprietary
models like Runway Gen-3 Alpha and offers commercial use under the MIT
License, though it requires users to host their own version for full
application integration. Despite some limitations, its launch
highlights the trend toward accessible AI video solutions. 

 THIS THREE-PERSON ROBOTICS STARTUP IS WORKING WITH DESIGNER YVES
BÉHAR TO BRING HUMANOIDS HOME (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Kind Humanoid's three-person team is developing a whimsical humanoid
robot called Mona. It is designed for home use rather than industrial
settings. The team plans to field-test an initial dozen prototypes
next year. Focusing on innovation and efficiency over fundraising,
Kind's approach contrasts with other AI-driven robotics manufacturers
targeting industrial markets. 

 INTELLECT–1: LAUNCHING THE FIRST DECENTRALIZED TRAINING OF A 10B
PARAMETER MODEL (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 INTELLECT-1 is the first decentralized 10-billion-parameter model. It
leverages global contributions for open-source AGI development.
OpenDiLoCo scaling has been achieved for training large models across
distributed devices, with new advancements in bandwidth efficiency and
fault tolerance. The new Prime framework further optimizes
decentralized training, increasing compute utilization to 98% for the
INTELLECT-1's 10-billion-parameter training run.
