 THE AGE OF FOSSIL FUELS IS OVER. THE ERA OF THE LITHIUM BATTERY IS
JUST BEGINNING. INVEST IN THE COMPANY EXTRACTING IT 300% MORE
EFFICIENTLY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Futuristic technology like AI requires future-friendly power sources.
With governments scrambling to divest their coal and gas interests,
lithium batteries [4] are set to drive the world into a new age ‚Äî
where remarkable feats of artificial intelligence are made possible by
electrification and renewable energy.

This means that demand for lithium is soon to drastically outstrip
supply, causing this vital mineral to skyrocket in price. GM-backed
EnergyX [4] is primely placed to meet this shift. With patented
technology [4] that extracts lithium 300% faster, the company has
effectively cornered the market overnight.

Their eagerly-awaited open-to-the-public investment round [4] is now
live.

Don't miss your chance. Invest in a renewable future. [5]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 YOUTUBE TRIES CONVINCING RECORD LABELS TO LICENSE MUSIC FOR AI SONG
GENERATOR (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube is negotiating with major record labels for licenses to use
their music in AI song-generation tools. It is offering substantial
upfront payments but facing resistance from artists worried about
devaluing their work. The platform, which trialed a generative AI tool
called "Dream Track," aims to expand its AI music capabilities,
potentially integrating them into YouTube Shorts. Meanwhile, the music
industry is pushing back against unlicensed AI usage, with leading
companies suing AI startups Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. 

 EVOLUTIONARY SCALE RAISES $142M SERIES A (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Evolutionary Scale, a biology startup, just emerged from stealth with
big backers. It also announced the release of its foundation model,
ESM 3, which is a 98B parameter model trained on 771B biology tokens
for 10^24 Flops. It used the model to discover a novel fluorescent
green protein unlike any known in nature. 

 WAYMO ONE IS NOW OPEN TO EVERYONE IN SAN FRANCISCO (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Waymo One now allows anyone in San Francisco to hail a ride with its
autonomous vehicles. The company is scaling up operations after
offering tens of thousands of trips weekly. Its all-electric fleet
supports the local economy and its sustainability goals. Citing
enhanced safety, Waymo says its vehicles are involved in significantly
fewer crashes compared to human drivers.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION WITH RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED INSTRUCTION TUNING
(21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Retrieval Augmented Instruction Tuning (RA-IT) improves information
extraction using large language models. 

 DEEPDIVE: SPARSE AUTOENCODERS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Golden Gate Claude was a powerful example of steering and
interpreting models with SAEs. This work provides an intuitive
explanation of how it works and has some example code for training
these models. 

 DATA CURATION VIA JOINT EXAMPLE SELECTION FURTHER ACCELERATES
MULTIMODAL LEARNING (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Actively selecting the next best batch is a challenging and open
problem in pre-training. This work from DeepMind explores how to spend
just 10% of the FLOPs and hard mine negative samples and still match
SOTA for various tasks.

 THE FUTURE OF LLM-BASED AGENTS: MAKING THE BOXES BIGGER (7 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 This post shares two critical approaches that help take Agents out of
the playground and into the real world: long-term planning and
system-level robustness. These introduce capabilities to develop
higher-order plans for Agents while allowing mid-episode adaptation as
well as systems approaches to intelligent orchestration of the models
that provide higher accuracy and performance. 

 HOW AI TRANSFORMS THE TRAVEL VALUE CHAIN (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Online travel has yet to crack the end-to-end trip experience. AI
offers fresh strategies for rebundling travel services, potentially
shifting profits. Decision support and coordination enabled by AI will
be crucial for companies to assert control over the travel rebundling
process. The travel industry's future may see incumbents leveraging AI
for competitive advantage, while traditional travel agents face market
erosion due to AI efficiencies. 

 AI-POWERED CONVERSION FROM ENZYME TO REACT TESTING LIBRARY AT SLACK
(11 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Slack engineers utilized a hybrid approach, combining Abstract Syntax
Tree transformations and AI Large Language Models, to automate the
conversion of over 15,000 unit tests from Enzyme to React Testing
Library. The team achieved an 80% success rate in automated
conversions by integrating Anthropic's Claude 2.1 AI model and
capturing the DOM tree for React components. This innovative project
underscores Slack's commitment to enhancing developer experience and
productivity through the application of AI. It is part of ongoing
efforts to stay ahead in the ever-evolving frontend landscape.
