HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

MICROSOFT OPEN SOURCES EVODIFF (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/microsoft-open-sources-evodiff-a-novel-protein-generating-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]

Microsoft has open-sourced EvoDiff, a novel AI model that the company
claims can generate high-fidelity, diverse proteins given a protein
sequence. 

PATRONUS AI RAISES $3M SEED TO RAISE CONFIDENCE IN ENTERPRISE LLMS (5
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.patronus.ai/blog/patronus-launch?utm_source=tldrai]

Led by Lightspeed, the team wants to build real world scoring to help
understand how useful LLMs are for enterprises. 

MLPERF RESULTS HIGHLIGHT GROWING IMPORTANCE OF GENERATIVE AI AND
STORAGE (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://mlcommons.org/en/news/mlperf-inference-storage-q323?utm_source=tldrai]

MLPerf has released results from two benchmark suites: MLPerf
Inference v3.1, which showcases record participation and performance
gains, and MLPerf Storage v0.5, which assesses storage system
performance for ML training workloads. The Inference benchmark suite
introduced a large language model and updated recommender tests,
reflecting emerging AI trends.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ALIGN A LANGUAGE MODEL WITHOUT TRAINING (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07124?utm_source=tldrai]

Alignment helps make language models more helpful and harmless. It can
sometimes hurt performance, but in general is a positive. Alignment is
expensive and requires substantial alignment data. However, if you
allow the model to rewind during generation after evaluating its own
output, it can improve alignment performance on the frozen model by up
to 81%. 

PUSHING MIXTURE OF EXPERTS TO THE LIMIT WITH PARAMETER EFFICIENCY (28
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05444?utm_source=tldrai]

Mixture of experts (MoEs) is a cool way to increase the capacity of a
model without increasing per token runtime. However, they're still
tricky to run quickly and fine-tune. Researchers find that if you
modify dense model parameters efficiently fine tuning to work with
MoEs you can dramatically reduce tuning costs without hurting
performance too much. 

MAKING BETTER RECOMMENDATIONS (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06217v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have developed a new model called HAMUR to improve how
models make suggestions or "recommendations" across multiple subjects
or domains, like music, books, or movies. Unlike older methods that
mix up information between these domains, HAMUR uses a special
technique to keep data separate and more flexible.

MAKING JPEG PLAY NICE WITH DEEP LEARNING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://christophreich1996.github.io/differentiable_jpeg/?utm_source=tldrai]

JPEG images are everywhere, but they don't work well with deep
learning because you can't easily tweak them during training. This
project reviews existing solutions and introduces a new method that
fixes these problems, making JPEG images fully adjustable and
compatible with deep learning systems. 

A NEW DATASET TO SPOT FAKE CELEBRITY IMAGES (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02218?utm_source=tldrai]

DeepFakeFace (DFF) is a collection of fake celebrity photos made with
advanced technology designed to help us get better at telling real
pictures from fake ones.

THE BUMPY ROAD TOWARD GLOBAL AI GOVERNANCE (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.noemamag.com/the-bumpy-road-toward-global-ai-governance/?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers suggested a global AI ethics agreement a few years ago,
emphasizing its feasibility despite philosophical differences. As the
U.S.-China AI competition grows, challenges like misperceptions and
language barriers persist in achieving global AI regulation.
