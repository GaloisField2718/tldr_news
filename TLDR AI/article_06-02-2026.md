HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-5.3-CODEX (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's GPT‑5.3‑Codex is a faster agentic coding model that
combines GPT‑5.2‑Codex's coding performance with GPT‑5.2's
reasoning and professional knowledge. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.6 (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has released Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded flagship model
with stronger agentic coding, longer task persistence, and improved
performance in large codebases. The model introduced a 1M-token
context window in beta and achieved state-of-the-art results across
several reasoning, coding, and economically valuable work evaluations.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 MIND THE GAAP AGAIN (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI desperately needs cash because it lacks economies of scale.
Microsoft is shipping billions to OpenAI because it would be
disastrous for the company if OpenAI went under. $10 billion of
OpenAI's revenue may have been effectively a subsidy from Microsoft.
This means that OpenAI was charging subscribers around 25% of what
they were costing. OpenAI would have significantly fewer subscribers
with an $80 per month subscription. 

 I SPENT $10,000 TO AUTOMATE MY RESEARCH AT OPENAI WITH CODEX (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many people drastically underestimate what Codex can do. This post
shares a simple setup that is routinely allocated hundreds of millions
of tokens. The author spent $10,000 on API costs this month. The post
also shares some killer use-cases for Codex, and reflects on how
organizations might become significantly more efficient in the near
future.

 VERCEL V0 ADDS PRODUCTION-GRADE FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The new v0 expands from demo tooling into a full production-ready
platform with enterprise-grade security, integrations, and support for
building and deploying real software with AI. 

 BUILDING A C COMPILER WITH A TEAM OF PARALLEL CLAUDES (13 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Multiple Claude instances worked in parallel to build a Rust-based C
compiler capable of compiling the Linux 6.9 kernel. This approach
reduced human supervision and explored autonomous LLM agent
capabilities via stress tests and a $20,000, 2,000-session effort. The
compiler, while functional, has limitations like inefficient code and
reliance on GCC for some features.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ON RECURSIVE SELF-IMPROVEMENT (PART I) (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The automation of AI research and engineering will begin in earnest
this year. This will create at least a step-change improvement in AI
progress. It could also change the dynamics of AI competition, alter
AI geopolitics, and much more. There will be more AI progress this
year than in all of the years that have come before, and that's a
conservative forecast. 

 GOOGLE'S 52X AI GROWTH (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's first-party models now process more than 10 billion tokens
per minute via direct API usage. This is a 52x increase
year-over-year. Google is committing capital at an unprecedented scale
to fuel this growth. The level of investment signals the company's
conviction that the demand for tokens is only just beginning.
