HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI ACADEMY (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI is starting a program for low and middle income countries to
expand access to AI knowledge. It also has a professional translation
of MMLU (a standard reasoning benchmark) in 15 different languages. 

 CHINA'S ALIBABA LAUNCHES OVER 100 NEW OPEN-SOURCE AI MODELS, RELEASES
TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Alibaba has released over 100 open-source AI models, enhancing its
technology to compete with rivals. The new Qwen 2.5 models, upgraded
in math and coding, span applications from automobiles to gaming.
Alibaba has also launched a new proprietary model, Qwen-Max 2.5, and a
text-to-video tool to strengthen its AI and cloud services offerings. 

 APPLE INTELLIGENCE IN MORE COUNTRIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple's iOS 18.1 will introduce key AI features, including an
enhanced Siri, generative AI tools in Photos, and ChatGPT integration.
iOS 18.2 will expand these features with localized support in various
English-speaking countries and add Image Playground and Genmoji.
Future updates, such as iOS 18.4, will further enhance Siri's
personalization and introduce new language support.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THE PRACTITIONER'S GUIDE TO THE MAXIMAL UPDATE PARAMETERIZATION (31
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Maximal Update Parameterization, or muP, is a way to initialize your
model so that you can transfer hyperparameters at any scale. This blog
from Eleuther and Cerebras includes a minimal nanoGPT example and lots
of instruction on how the process works. 

 TEACHING DIFFUSION MODELS TO COUNT (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Getting a diffusion model to generate a certain number of an object
is currently challenging. This work introduces a counting token that
allows a model to successfully generate just a few or very many of a
certain object. It isn't perfect as it builds on base stable
diffusion, but it does much better than current alternatives. 

 EVALUATING LONG-CONTEXT MODELS (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed a standardized evaluation protocol to
compare methods for extending language models to handle long document
contexts.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 NEW RESEARCH BY ORCA: 62% OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DEPLOYED AN AI
PACKAGE WITH AT LEAST ONE CVE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 The results are in - and they're not pretty. Orca Security has
published its new State of AI Security Report [10], based on scans of
billions of cloud assets. Organizations and cloud providers are
prioritizing AI development velocity over security considerations,
leading to preventable risks. See the full findings [10] 

 3D VISION TRANSFORMER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository hosts an implementation of a 3D Vision Transformer
designed for efficient field boundary delineation using time series
satellite imagery. The model leverages spatio-temporal correlations to
improve accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging
conditions such as partial cloud cover. 

 SPEEDING UP LONG-CONTEXT PROCESSING WITH CRITIPREFILL (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 CritiPrefill is a method designed to accelerate the prefilling phase
of long-context processing in large language models. By identifying
and skipping non-essential computations, this approach speeds up the
process by up to 3x on certain models. 

 IMPROVING LLM REASONING WITH MAGICORE (20 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 MAgICoRe is a new strategy to improve reasoning in large language
models by addressing challenges in refinement processes. It
categorizes problems by difficulty, using simpler strategies for easy
tasks and multi-agent iterative refinement for harder ones.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DOCUMENT SIMILARITY SEARCH WITH COLIPALI (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A great blog post that explores the popular multimodal RAG system and
how it can be used to solve practical problems. 

 DEVELOPING NEW MATERIALS WITH AI (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 By analyzing X-ray crystallography data, the model could help
researchers develop new materials for many applications, including
batteries and magnets. 

 WHEN WILL AI OUTTHINK HUMANS? (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article explores when AI might surpass humans in cognitive
volume, introducing "thought-hours" as a metric to quantify AI's
cognitive output compared to human labor. Using assumptions around
reading speeds and productivity, a thought-hour equates to 10,000
tokens. Current trends suggest AI could outthink humans within a
decade, given the rapid growth in AI capabilities and cost
efficiencies.

QUICK LINKS

 TRUSTWORTHY AI APPS START WITH A TRUSTWORTHY SIGN IN EXPERIENCE
(SPONSOR) [17] 

 You can't sell AI to businesses without modern authentication: SSO +
MFA + all the bells and whistles. Luckily, you don't need to build it
from scratch: Clerk is free for <10k MAUs [18] 

 MICROSOFT UPDATES ITS AI SUITE WITH MORE AGENTS AND COPILOTS (1
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft is expanding its generative AI suite to include automated
agents, adding features within its Copilot assistants and unveiling a
new tool to help multiple workers collaboratively interact with
artificial intelligence. 

 SAM ALTMAN LEAVES OPENAI BOARD'S SAFETY AND SECURITY COMMITTEE (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 OpenAI said that CEO Sam Altman is leaving the board's safety and
security committee, which will now be fully composed of independent
board members. 

 PRACTITIONERS GUIDE TO TRITON (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK) [21] 

 A great lecture from the CUDA Mode group about getting started with
the CUDA framework, Triton.
