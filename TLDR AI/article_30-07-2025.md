 WHY YOUR AI POCS NEVER LAUNCH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Only 20% of AI projects see real business impact. What goes wrong
with the other 80%?

After helping hundreds of companies deploy AI solutions on AWS,
Mission identified exactly what separates the successful AI
implementations from those that stall:

✔️ Organizational strategy

✔️ Data & technical infrastructure

✔️ Team skills

✔️ Clear use cases

Want to see where your organization stands? This 10-minute AI
Readiness Assessment [4] will show you which areas need attention,
plus you'll get a roadmap tailored to your situation. For a limited
time, you can schedule a free 60-minute strategy session with our AI
experts to discuss your results.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC IN TALKS TO RAISE FRESH CAPITAL AT $170 BILLION VALUATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The funding round, led by Iconiq Capital, would nearly triple
Anthropic's valuation from $61.5 billion just four months ago. 

 CHATGPT STUDY MODE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI launched Study Mode in ChatGPT to promote active learning by
guiding students through problems with step-by-step prompts tailored
to their goals and proficiency. This feature aims to support deeper
understanding rather than just providing answers, and is now available
to all logged-in users. 

 VIDEO OVERVIEWS IN NOTEBOOKLM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google introduced Video Overviews in NotebookLM to transform complex
source material into concise, AI-generated videos, helping users grasp
key ideas faster.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SCAMMING SUBSTACK? (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many viral Substack essays carry telltale signs of artificial
authorship — what one author calls the "Impersonal Universal" voice
characterized by anonymous bylines, predictable anecdotes, and
formulaic contrasts (“It's not X - it's Y!”). While human Substack
authors bemoan the lackluster prose, the greater concern is not the
artistic purity of the profession but the eyes and subscription
revenues that might otherwise go to better, authentic writers. 

 THE MAKING OF DARIO AMODEI (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic's outspoken CEO attributes his passion for scientific
progress to a personal tragedy: his father died from a rare illness
just four years before researchers developed a cure that turned it
from 50% fatal to 95% curable. That near-miss with scientific timing
caused Amodei to abandon theoretical physics for biology and
eventually turn his attention to AI, where he has played a key role in
research responsible for AI's rapid acceleration.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 EATING THEIR OWN BOT FOOD: HOW ANTHROPIC USES CLAUDE CODE (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Anthropic has found a bunch of interesting ways to use Claude Code
across almost every team - from engineering and data science to
security, growth marketing, design, legal, and more. Read about
different teams' use cases and workflows + at least one actionable tip
[10] from each team. Read the blog [10] 

 ELEVENLABS MAKES BUILDING CONVERSATIONAL AI AGENTS EASY WITH NEW CLI
(3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ElevenLabs' new command-line interface tool allows developers to
manage conversational AI agents as code. It enables version control,
automation, and deployment consistency to voice and chat agent
workflows. The tool has built-in support for multi-environment
configurations, web hook and client-side tool integrations, and secure
authentication. It includes a local scratchpad that enables coding
agents to reason about and update AI agents programmatically. A video
demonstrating the tool's features is available in the article. 

 DAILY BENCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The open-source dashboard monitors model performance across providers
like Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI to detect quality regressions that
can occur between official releases due to inference changes,
distillation, or quantization. 

 WAN2.2: OPEN-SOURCE MOE VIDEO GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Wan2.2 introduces the first open-source Mixture-of-Experts model for
video generation, combining expert-guided diffusion steps with
granular cinematic controls.

MISCELLANEOUS

 IN THE FIELD OF CYBERSECURITY, A DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN THE
"BLUE TEAM" TASK OF BUILDING A SECURE SYSTEM, AND THE "RED TEAM" TASK
OF LOCATING VULNERABILITIES IN SUCH SYSTEMS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The blue team is necessary to create products, but the red team is
just as essential due to the damage that can result from deploying
insecure systems. The output of a blue team is only as strong as its
weakest link - strong systems with weak components will be insecure
while conveying a false sense of security. Contributions to red teams
can often be additive - reports that contain both a serious and a more
trivial vulnerability are more useful than reports that only contain a
serious issue. AI may be better on the red team than the blue team -
it may be better to get them to critique the work of human experts
instead of directly replacing that output. 

 LIGHTWEIGHT EXPERIMENT TRACKER FROM HUGGING FACE (8 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Hugging Face released Trackio, a free, open-source experiment
tracking tool with a local dashboard and integration with Spaces.
