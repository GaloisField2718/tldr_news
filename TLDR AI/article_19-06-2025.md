HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META TARGETS FORMER GITHUB CEO NAT FRIEDMAN TO BOOST ITS AI RESEARCH
EFFORTS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta is trying to bring on board former GitHub Chief Executive Nat
Friedman and Daniel Gross, Friedman's partner in the AI-focused
venture capital fund, NFDG. Friedman helped establish GitHub as a
pioneer in AI with the launch of GitHub Copilot. He departed GitHub to
focus on investments at NFDG. NFDG focuses on identifying hot AI
startups and investing anywhere between $1 million to $100 million in
seed and growth rounds. It has backed notable companies over the
years, like Stripe, Character Technologies Inc., and Perplexity AI. 

 MIDJOURNEY LAUNCHES ITS FIRST AI VIDEO GENERATION MODEL, V1 (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Midjourney's V1 turns any image into a 5-second video though it's
Discord-only at launch. The company's long-term goal is to generate
interactive 3D environments in real time. 

 REAL-TIME TALK AND LISTEN IN GOOGLE'S SEARCH LIVE (1 MINUTE READ) [6]


 U.S. testers can talk to Google Search via the new Live icon,
receiving AI‑generated spoken answers and follow‑up suggestions
along with on‑screen web links.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 TRACING AND FIXING EMERGENT MISALIGNMENT (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's researchers identified an internal activation pattern linked
to misaligned personas in language models and showed it can be
detected and dampened through targeted retraining, hinting at an
early‑warning system for alignment drift. 

 A PODCAST ON GEMINI'S CODING CAPABILITIES (1 HOUR VIDEO) [8] 

 Google's Release Notes podcast features Connie Fan and Danny Tarlow
discussing the design goals behind Gemini's code generation, the
emergence of “vibe coding,” and how AI may reshape programming
languages. 

 WRITING IN THE AGE OF LLMS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Blog posts and technical papers are increasingly plagued by the
"synthetic flavor" of LLM writing—empty summary sentences,
persistent vagueness, and dull sentence structure. The greatest value
of AI is for outlining, polishing early drafts, and targeted editing.
Decent writing is cheaper than ever to produce - knowing what's worth
writing, or not, still requires human judgment.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 PROMPT YOUR WAY TO A SECURE AND FUNCTIONAL INTERNAL TOOL WITH REFINE
AI (SPONSOR) [10] 

 How many times have you thought: “I wish we had a GUI for that
[automation / admin action / dashboard]”? With Refine AI, any
internal tool is one prompt away. Describe what you need, and Refine
will guide you through project setup, generate CRUD pages, add
authentication, and handle secure deployment. Build your first tool
for free [11]
Get a glimpse of Refine AI in action. [12]

 IS THERE A HALF-LIFE FOR THE SUCCESS RATES OF AI AGENTS? (11 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The performance of AI agents on longer-duration tasks can be
explained by an extremely simple mathematical model - a constant rate
of failing during each minute a human would take to do the task. This
implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length of the
task. The regularity allows for the success rate for an agent at
different task lengths to be estimated. The underlying cause of
failure on longer tasks is likely due to the increasingly large set of
subtasks - failing any single one fails the whole task. 

 REMOTE MCP SUPPORT IN CLAUDE CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claude Code now has support for remote MCP servers. Developers can
now connect tools and data sources to personal their coding experience
without needing to manage local servers. Claude Code can access both
tools and resources exposed by MCP servers. It can also be integrated
with any remote MCP server. The growing ecosystem of servers means
that new capabilities are constantly coming online. 

 TEXT-TO-LORA: INSTANT TRANSFORMER ADAPTION (32 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sakana AI researchers built a system that can instantly customize
large language models using just a text description, no training data
or lengthy fine-tuning required. Their T2L model works by compressing
hundreds of LoRA adapters (small, efficient modifications to AI
models) into a single network that generates new customizations on
demand. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEPNVME UPGRADE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The latest DeepNVMe release broadens support to model checkpointing
and inference workloads, adds PCIe Gen5 NVMe scaling, and introduces
CPU‑only and offset‑based I/O options to boost data‑bound
training speeds in DeepSpeed 0.17.1 and above. 

 THE OPENAI FILES (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new investigative report compiles whistleblower testimonies
revealing OpenAI's transformation from a nonprofit to a $300 billion
company, including claims that senior staff warned the board Sam
Altman was "psychologically abusive" and shouldn't lead them to AGI.
