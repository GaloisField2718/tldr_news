SNAPCHAT RELEASES AI CHATBOT POWERED BY CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription?utm_source=tldrai]


Snapchat is introducing a chatbot powered by the latest version of
OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. According to Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, it‚Äôs a bet
that AI chatbots will increasingly become a part of everyday life for
more people. Named ‚ÄúMy AI,‚Äù Snapchat‚Äôs bot will be pinned to the
app‚Äôs chat tab above conversations with friends. While initially
only available for $3.99 a month Snapchat Plus subscribers, the goal
is to eventually make the bot available to all of Snapchat‚Äôs 750
million monthly users. 

BEATING OPENAI CLIP WITH 100X LESS DATA AND COMPUTE (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.unum.cloud/blog/2023-02-20-efficient-multimodality?utm_source=tldrai]


The Unum AI team has been pre-training several Multi-Modal Models for
Semantic Search and is now releasing several performant checkpoints on
the HuggingFace portal. They claim to have trained a more precise
Vision-Language transformer than the multi-lingual mCLIP and will
explain how they did it.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

REALFUSION: 360¬∞ RECONSTRUCTION OF ANY OBJECT FROM A SINGLE IMAGE (15
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10663?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper describes a method for reconstructing a full 360‚ó¶
photographic model of an object using a single image of it. The
approach involves fitting a neural radiance field to the image, but
the problem is found to be severely ill-posed. To address this, an
off-the-shelf conditional image generator based on diffusion is used,
and a prompt is engineered to encourage it to "dream up" novel views
of the object. The DreamFusion method is used to fuse the given input
view, the conditional prior, and other regularizers in a final,
consistent reconstruction. 

BETTER JOINT TEXT-IMAGE EMBEDDINGS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.unum.cloud/blog/2023-02-20-efficient-multimodality?utm_source=tldrai]


Joint multimodal models like CLIP are key to much of the recent
success of Generative AI technologies. Unum has announced a set of ViT
based text-image models that are competitive with CLIP in performance,
best CLIP in multilingual cases, and have dramatically reduced
inference time. They have released checkpoints on HuggingFace. 

LANGUAGE IS NOT ALL YOU NEED (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14045?utm_source=tldrai] 

MLLM is a multimodal transformer trained on internet scale text/image
data. It uses a frozen CLIP image encoder and a Magneto decoder only
transformer. It has 1.3B parameters and was trained for 360B tokens.
It was trained with TorchScale, a new exciting framework, and finished
off with language only instruction tuning. It got 26% on an IQ test,
which is better than random chance. It has 73% zeroshot ImageNet
classification and positive transfer between modalities. It has a 64k
vocab size and no code yet but should be coming soon.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

OPENAI‚ÄôS WHISPER LARGE ON AN IPHONE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/pull/540?utm_source=tldrai] 

Georgi has been working on Whisper.cpp which dramatically speeds up
the runtime of OpenAI‚Äôs state of the art speech to text model. He
has included a WASM version for the web. This latest model uses 4-bit
integer quantization. Interestingly, this type of quantization only
seems to work on larger models and fails on smaller models. 

CACTI: A FRAMEWORK FOR IMITATION LEARNING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://cacti-framework.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The authors propose a framework for scaling robot learning in
multi-task and multi-scene manipulation in kitchen environments, both
in simulation and in the real world. The proposed framework, called
CACTI, comprises four stages that handle data collection, data
augmentation, visual representation learning, and imitation policy
training. The approach uses state-of-the-art generative models for
data augmentation and pre-trained visual representations to improve
training efficiency. Experimental results show that CACTI enables
efficient training of a single policy that can perform 10 manipulation
tasks involving kitchen objects on a real robot setup, and 18 semantic
tasks across 100 layout variations for each individual task in a
simulated kitchen environment. 

SCENE DIFFUSER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/scenediffuser/Scene-Diffuser?utm_source=tldrai] 

Scene Diffuser is a conditional generative model for 3D scene
understanding. This repository is the official implementation of paper
"Diffusion-based Generation, Optimization, and Planning in 3D Scenes".
SceneDiffuser provides a unified model for solving scene-conditioned
generation, optimization, and planning. In contrast to prior work,
SceneDiffuser is intrinsically scene-aware, physics-based, and
goal-oriented. 

T3-TURBO-AI (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/zckly/create-t3-turbo-ai?utm_source=tldrai] 

T3-Turbo-AI is a starter repo for building full-stack, type-safe,
LLM-powered web apps.

META INCREASING RESOURCES TO PRODUCT TEAM FOR GENERATIVE AI (4 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.axios.com/2023/02/27/meta-generative-ai-products?utm_source=tldrai]


Despite rumors of another set of layoffs from the social media giant,
they are increasing their investment in Generative AI across product
areas. They are forming a team to help with integration into their
suite of apps and their future metaverse projects. 

LATENT BLENDING BETWEEN SYNTHETIC IMAGES (HUGGINGFACE SPACE)
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/lunarring/latentblending?utm_source=tldrai]


Latent Blending is a clever usage of Stable Diffusion‚Äôs latent space
structure. By generating two images you can blend between them in
latent space and produce a lovely animation. This process cannot yet
be used for character animation, but the building blocks are there.

LoRA models can be plugged into a Stable Diffusion pipeline to change
out the styles and quality of generated images. This model from Latent
Labs allows you to generate panoramas and beautiful 360 scenes.
