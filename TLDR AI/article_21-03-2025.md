MISCELLANEOUS

 SYNCHRON'S BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE NOW HAS NVIDIA'S AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Neurotech company Synchron's Nvidia-powered brain-computer interface
enables individuals with paralysis to control their home environment
using the Apple Vision Pro headset. Synchron's BCI implants translate
brain activity into commands, with improved speed and accuracy through
Nvidia's Holoscan platform. By developing a cognitive AI based on
brain data, Synchron aims for a scalable BCI system that offers more
autonomous control for users with minimal training. 

 WHAT DOES OPENAI REALLY WANT FROM TRUMP? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI's proposal to the White House seeks to bypass state AI laws
like California's SB 1047 by leveraging federal trade laws against
China and requesting significant AI infrastructure investments. With
nearly 900 state AI bills under consideration, OpenAI argues that
diverse state regulations could cause chaos, while a lack of federal
framework leaves the industry vulnerable. Critics point out the
absence of a national governance model in OpenAI's plan, which relies
heavily on national security concerns to advance its agenda. 

 ANTHROPIC SUPPORTS AI TRANSPARENCY IN POLICY DISCUSSIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Anthropic has responded to Governor Newsom's AI Working Group report,
advocating for increased transparency in AI development and security
practices. The company highlighted the need for standardized
disclosure of safety measures to build public trust without stifling
innovation.
