 MEASURING THE IMPACT OF GENERATIVE AI ON DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Adevinta set out to quantify the impact of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot
[4] on its thousands of developers. They measured adoption, accepted
lines of code, and self-reported workflow acceleration.

Read the full findings on the Adevinta blog [4], including:

‚Üí The average acceptance rate for Copilot suggestions sits around
20%

‚Üí Which % of developers are using which LLM assistant

‚Üí Who benefits most and least from genAI coding tools

 MISTRAL'S NEW AI NON-PRODUCTION LICENSE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral is working to find a balance between openness and business
success. It has a new license aimed at striking that balance. It will
continue releasing other projects under Apache 2.0 as well as the new
MNPL license. 

 SONIC: A LOW-LATENCY VOICE MODEL FOR LIFELIKE SPEECH (6 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A new model from the creators of SSMs, Mamba, and sub quadratic
Transformer variants. Importantly, their new company Cartesia has
trained a lightning-fast, realistic voice generation model. This
points to their desire to move into the assistants' space. 

 VOX MEDIA AND THE ATLANTIC SIGN CONTENT DEALS WITH OPENAI (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has signed licensing deals with The Atlantic and Vox Media,

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MISTRAL'S CODE MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mistral released a 22B code model with 32k context. It is a powerful
and fast model with broad performance across many programming
languages. It has open weights and is available via Mistral's
platform. 

 PRISM: SMALL MOLECULE FOUNDATION MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PRISM is a foundation model trained on 1.2 billion small molecule
mass spectra to enhance mass spectrometry analysis in drug discovery.
It uses self-supervised learning to predict molecular properties from
complex mixtures without prior annotations, significantly advancing
the field of metabolomics. The model improves the identification and
understanding of largely unknown natural molecules, accelerating the
discovery of new therapeutics by leveraging massive, previously
untapped spectral data. 

 DIFFUSION MODELS FOR INVERSE PROBLEMS (19 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DMPlug is a novel plug-in method that uses pretrained diffusion
models (DMs) to solve inverse problems (IPs). Unlike existing
interleaving methods, DMPlug views the reverse diffusion process as a
function, addressing both manifold feasibility and measurement
feasibility effectively.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ENHANCED SUPER-RESOLUTION EFFICIENCY (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 PatchScaler is a diffusion-based method for single image
super-resolution (SR) that significantly enhances inference
efficiency. 

 3D UNDERSTANDING WITH ENHANCED SEGMENTATION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Reason3D is a novel multimodal large language model designed for
comprehensive 3D environment understanding. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SCALE PRIVATE LEADERBOARD (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scale has made a private leaderboard for evaluating language models.
The ordering isn't too surprising, but one interesting finding is the
Llama 3 70B is extremely good at following instructions, often better
than Claude Opus.
