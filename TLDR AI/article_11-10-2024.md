 O1 REPLICATION PROGRESS REPORT (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers from GAIR and NYU have been working to understand the key
algorithmic innovations that led to OpenAI's o1 model developing such
strong performance. In this report, they introduce the idea of
“Journey Learning” data, which when given to a model improves math
performance by 8% in absolute terms. 

 I WANT TO BREAK SOME LAWS TOO (20 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article discusses using an automated pipeline for data cleaning,
inspired by the Minipile method, which pruned datasets to achieve
significant performance results with a fraction of the original data
size. By employing techniques like few-shot prompting and clustering,
the approach streamlines dataset refinement for AI training, breaking
traditional scaling laws by focusing on data quality over quantity.
The findings suggest that foundational datasets with more refined data
can optimize AI model training, reducing resource consumption while
enhancing performance.
