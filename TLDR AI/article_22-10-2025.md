 THE CONTINUAL LEARNING PROBLEM (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Memory layers are a natural architecture for models that are always
training and continually learning from experience over time.
Finetuning memory layers enables learning without forgetting much more
effectively than LoRA. Continual learning and memory is still a huge
and rich space to explore. We are only just starting to reach the
point where we can imagine what it might look like to have models that
learn online in the real world. 

 MINI MODELS BATTLE: CLAUDE HAIKU 4.5 VS GLM-4.6 VS GPT-5 MINI (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Haiku 4.5, GLM-4.6, and GPT-5 Mini all fall within a similar
price bracket. They are mid-tier models optimized for cost and speed
rather than maximum capability. GPT-5 Mini delivers the strongest
concurrency safeguards, Haiku 4.5 is the fastest with the most
features, and GLM-4.6 produces multi-file architecture but requires
disabling reasoning mode for tool calls. Each model makes different
trade-offs.

 THE NOT-SO BITTER LESSON (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Maybe AGI will take over everything, but we're clearly not there yet
and probably won't be anytime soon. Software engineers still have a
lot of time before they become obsolete. Right now, developers should
focus on building scalable systems that leverage search and compute,
build harnesses instead of solutions, and define problems instead of
hard-coding solutions.

 AIRBNB CEO SAYS CHATGPT ISN'T READY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Airbnb's CEO, Brian Chesky, said that he didn't integrate Airbnb's
travel app with OpenAI's ChatGPT because ChatGPT's connective tools
aren't quite ready yet. Airbnb will monitor the development of
ChatGPT's app integrations and may consider adding them in the future.
Chesky, who is close friends with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, said he
advised OpenAI on its new capability for third-party developers to
make their apps available within ChatGPT. Airbnb on Tuesday announced
new AI tools to let customers take more actions without the need for a
live representative. The company's AI customer service agent now
displays action buttons and links that can help people complete
reservation changes and cancellations.
