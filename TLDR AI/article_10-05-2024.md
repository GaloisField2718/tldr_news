HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 YELLOW RAISES $5M FOR ASSISTIVE 3D MODELING (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A former Google ML Head of Product and an MIT professor have raised
money from a16z's new game fund for generative 3D character creation. 

 STABILITY AI DISCORD BOT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stability AI has introduced Stable Artisan, a system combining all of
its models that can be run from Discord. This is likely a play to
compete directly with Midjourney. 

 ELEVENLABS PREVIEWS MUSIC-GENERATING AI MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Voice AI startup ElevenLabs is previewing a new model that converts
prompts into song lyrics. The company is using a promotional strategy
similar to the one OpenAI used for Sora AI.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CONSISTENCY LANGUAGE MODELS (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Predicting more than one token at a time is an interesting paradigm
of active research. If successful, it would dramatically improve
generation time for many large language models. The approach in this
post, which mirrors consistency models from image synthetics, attempts
to use a parallel decoding strategy on fine-tuned LLMs to speed up
generation. Early results match speculative decoding performance of
3x. 

 YOU ONLY CACHE ONCE (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The YOCO architecture is a decoder-decoder model that reduces GPU
memory demands while retaining global attention capabilities. It
consists of a self-decoder and cross-decoder, allowing for efficient
caching and reuse of key-value pairs. YOCO achieves favorable
performance compared to traditional Transformers, with significant
improvements in inference memory, latency, and throughput, making it
suitable for large language models and long context lengths.

 BUZZ PRETRAINING DATASET (HUGGING FACE HUB) [11] 

 Buzz is a novel dataset that includes preference data in the
pretraining mix. Its researchers have also released several models
that were trained using this data. They found that the models perform
well on a number of human preference tasks. 

 ACHIEVING FAIRNESS WITH A NEW POST-PROCESSING ALGORITHM (36 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 This new post-processing algorithm addresses model bias by applying a
"fairness cost" to recalibrate output scores, ensuring compliance with
various group fairness criteria such as statistical parity, equal
opportunity, and equalized odds. 

 ENHANCED CHANGE DETECTION IN IMAGES (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DiffMatch is a novel semi-supervised change detection method that
leverages visual language models to synthesize pseudo labels for
unlabeled data, providing additional supervision signals.
