HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MIRA MURATI'S THINKING MACHINES LAB RAISES $2B AT $12B VALUATION (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 With no revenue or products, the former OpenAI CTO's startup landed
one of the largest seed rounds ever from Andreessen Horowitz, Nvidia,
and others. Two-thirds of the team are former OpenAI employees. 

 NVIDIA TO RESUME H20 GPU SALES IN CHINA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to restart H20 GPU sales to
China following U.S. government licensing assurances and announced a
new fully compliant RTX PRO GPU tailored for industrial AI use in
China. 

 VOXTRAL: MISTRAL'S OPEN-SOURCE AUDIO MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mistral's has released Voxtral, its first open-source audio model
suite. It features a 24B parameter model for large-scale use and a 3B
variant for edge deployment.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 REFLECTIONS ON WORKING AT OPENAI (27 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A former OpenAI employee shares personal reflections on the company's
culture and mission, describing it as a uniquely impactful yet complex
place to work. The post provides insight into the internal atmosphere
during a pivotal time. 

 GROK 4 VARIOUS THINGS (48 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 xAI had the goal of releasing something that could be called 'the
world's smartest artificial intelligence' - and it successfully found
benchmarks to enable it to take that claim. However, these benchmarks
are misleading. While Grok 4 has a lot of raw intelligence, for most
practical purposes, it seems to be inferior to OpenAI's o3. This post
takes a more nuanced look at Grok 4's abilities.

 CONTEXT ROT: HOW INCREASING INPUT TOKENS IMPACTS LLM PERFORMANCE (31
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LLM performance degrades significantly as input length increases,
even on simple tasks like text retrieval and replication. Multiple
controlled experiments revealed that even frontier models don't
process context uniformly, and performance becomes increasingly
unreliable with longer inputs. 

 ASYMMETRY OF VERIFICATION AND VERIFIER'S LAW (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Asymmetry of verification is the idea that some tasks are much easier
to verify than to solve. Examples of this are everywhere, for example,
Sudokus take a lot of time to solve, but it is trivial to check if any
given solution is correct. One of the most important realizations
about asymmetry of verification is that it is possible to improve the
asymmetry by having privileged information about the task - for
example, it is trivial to check test answers with an answer key on
hand. AI will likely be much better at verifiable tasks because it's
much easier to solve verifiable tasks. 

 BLOCK OPEN SOURCES GOOSE AI AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A coding AI agent that supports any LLM backend, including local
models, and has both desktop and CLI interfaces. Like typical coding
agents, it handles end-to-end development workflows from planning to
testing.

 THE "BUBBLE" OF RISK: IMPROVING ASSESSMENTS FOR OFFENSIVE
CYBERSECURITY AGENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Improving AI agents for offensive cybersecurity tasks is cheap and
easy: with just $36 of compute time, Princeton researchers increased
attack success rates by over 40% through simple techniques like prompt
refinement and self-training. Static safety assessments miss this
"bubble of risk" where adversaries can cheaply adapt open-source
models beyond their original safety profiles, especially in
cybersecurity, where clear success signals enable rapid iteration. 

 UNDERWRITING SUPERINTELLIGENCE (27 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Incentive Flywheel, discovered by Benjamin Franklin, has been at
the heart of balancing progress and security for new technology waves
since it was created when fires threatened Philadelphia's growth. It
won't appear fast enough on its own for AI - it needs to be
jump-started. This essay outlines 25 actions that entrepreneurs and
policymakers must take by 2030 across agents, foundation models, and
data centers. If the West slows down progress in AI, China could
dominate the 21st century, but if it accelerates recklessly, accidents
will halt progress - like with nuclear power.
