 BUILDING TRUST IN THE AI BOOM: JOIN THE VIRTUAL EVENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In today's AI boom, shipping fast gets attention—but building trust
gets results. Startups now face higher expectations earlier than ever,
with investors demanding clean financials and enterprise buyers
requiring strong security before deals close.

With the right systems, trust shifts from a checkbox to a growth
engine—and that's where Vanta and Mercury step in, equipping
early-stage teams to build investor and enterprise-grade credibility
without slowing down.

JOIN THE LIVE WEBINAR [4] WITH LEADERS AT VANTA AND MERCURY TO LEARN
LEARN HOW TO:

 	* Pass investor diligence with confidence and fewer follow-ups
 	* Avoid security and procurement blockers before they stall a deal
 	* Stay ahead of compliance and risk without hiring full teams
 	* Demonstrate capital discipline in a market that rewards it

 OPENAI READIES ORDERS IN CHATGPT FOR NATIVE CHECKOUT AND TRACKING (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is preparing to introduce a new 'Orders' section in ChatGPT
settings that will let users add credit cards directly to ChatGPT for
streamlined purchases. The feature will likely benefit frequent
ChatGPT users who purchase plugins, digital goods, or services through
the platform. OpenAI is also working to bring parental controls to the
ChatGPT web interface. The additional checkout and parental controls
align with broader industry trends to turn AI chat platforms into
daily utilities with payment, safety, and management features built
in. 

 SILICON VALLEY RACES TO BUILD "ENVIRONMENTS" FOR TRAINING AI AGENTS
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Major AI labs are ramping up spending on reinforcement learning
environments, with Anthropic reportedly considering over $1 billion
next year, shifting from static datasets to interactive simulations
where agents practice tasks like web browsing. Startups are crowding
into the space to compete with established human-generated data
vendors like Scale AI for what could become the next critical
infrastructure for AI development. 

 NVIDIA'S RTX6000D CHIP FOR CHINA SEES LUKEWARM DEMAND (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Chinese tech giants are largely avoiding Nvidia's new RTX6000D AI
chip, specifically designed for them to satisfy US export
restrictions, because they're able to get more performant, banned
Nvidia chips for half the price through the grey market.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW I GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE ON ARC-AGI AGAIN SWAPPING PYTHON FOR
ENGLISH (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ARC-AGI is an intelligence test designed to measure abstract pattern
recognition. Humans are able to readily solve the puzzles on the test,
but large language models struggle significantly. This post discusses
how an AI researcher was able to achieve a new high score of 79.6% on
ARC v2 at $8.42 per task and 29.4% on ARC v2, a new state-of-the-art. 

 HOW CAN WE GET ENOUGH DATA TO TRAIN A ROBOT GPT? (11 MINUTE READ) [9]


 The amount of data needed to train a robot GPT could take tens to
hundreds of thousands of years to collect. The process could be sped
up by scaling robot fleets, using simulation data, and using human
video data, but the resources necessary will be clearly out of reach
of most academic labs and would likely require a fairly substantial
investment. A consortium of companies could almost certainly get there
in a matter of years. The biggest issue would be pooling all of the
data in one place and actually putting it to good use. 

 AI COMPANION FUTURES (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI companions will become more enjoyable to talk to than humans due
to financial incentives to optimize them as such and the lack of human
constraints (like needing to sleep or having off days). Eventually,
these omniscient-seeming life coaches will be omnipresent through
wearable devices that most people will use for advice on all kinds of
decisions while maintaining an illusion of control. Current LLMs
already provide better high-level life guidance than the median
person.

 The team that released the Kimi K2 model achieved RL parameter
updates for 1T parameter models in approximately 20 seconds. This post
looks at how the team significantly optimized a key efficiency
bottleneck in RL end-to-end training time. The team encountered many
challenges along the way to implementing efficient parameter updates -
the post shares some of the problems and solutions to those problems.
