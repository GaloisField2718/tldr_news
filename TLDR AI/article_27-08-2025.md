 BUILD AI WORKFLOWS THAT ARE _ACTUALLY_ HELPFUL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 At many organizations, AI adoption is now a key initiative. But in
too many cases, usage never hits escape velocity.

Notion asked 1,000 product and engineering leaders [4] how they're
integrating AI into their work. The findings reveal three major
roadblocks: incompatible workflows, resource constraints, and data
quality issues. In the full report, you'll learn how to use AI the
right way, including:

>> What the best teams are doing right (examples from OpenAI, dbt
Labs, and Pinecone [4])

>> How to build context-rich AI systems that teams actually trust

>> Strategic frameworks to address implementation challenges

>> A practical AI readiness assessment

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE FOR CHROME (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has begun piloting a Claude Chrome extension that allows
the AI to take actions directly in the browser, including viewing
pages, clicking, and filling forms. The rollout prioritizes safety,
with limited access for feedback to improve oversight tools before
broader deployment. 

 GEMINI 2.5 FLASH IMAGE MODEL RELEASED (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is an advanced image generation and editing
model that supports image blending, character consistency, and natural
language-driven edits.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY I'M AGAINST CLAUDE CODE'S GREP-ONLY RETRIEVAL? IT JUST BURNS TOO
MANY TOKENS (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI coding assistants still don't agree on the best method for
searching codebases for context. There are currently two approaches:
vector search-powered RAG and keyword search with grep. While grep is
fast, exact, and predictable, it drowns users in irrelevant matches,
burns tokens, and stalls workflows. Vector search-based RAG makes
search dramatically faster and more accurate, and it reduces token use
by 40% or more. 

 IN SEARCH OF AI PSYCHOSIS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unlike past technologies, where dubious ideas required social
transmission (like 1990s Russians believing Lenin was literally a
mushroom after a TV hoax), AI allows completely isolated users to
develop elaborate theories through private conversations that bounce
increasingly extreme ideas back with growing confidence. A survey
estimates 1 in 10,000 users develop AI-induced psychosis annually,
though most cases involve pre-existing mental health conditions rather
than healthy individuals becoming psychotic.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 AI GOVERNANCE BENCHMARKS: SEE WHY FORRESTER NAMED CREDO AI A LEADER
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 AI is maturing from experiment to critical business infrastructure -
but governance is still lagging. Named a Leader in The Forrester
Wave™, Credo AI helps enterprises close the gap with purpose-built
AI governance [10]. Stay compliant with frameworks like the EU AI Act
and NIST RMF while building trust at scale. Download the report [10]. 

 LLM CONTEXT MANAGEMENT: HOW TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND LOWER COSTS (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 While modern large language models feature increasingly large context
windows, simply filling the context window with as much information as
possible is bad practice. It creates context bloat, which can lead to
worse performance and higher costs. The key to managing context is
understanding what is in it. Be selective with MCP be servers - if a
server is not needed for the current task, consider disabling it to
free up context space. 

 INTERNVL 3.5: OPEN MULTIMODAL REASONING MODEL (48 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 InternVL 3.5 introduces Cascade Reinforcement Learning to improve
multimodal reasoning and alignment, along with optimizations like
Visual Resolution Router and decoupled deployment. 

 THE CONTEXT WINDOW PROBLEM: SCALING AGENTS BEYOND TOKEN LIMITS (5
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Current LLM context windows (~1 million tokens) are too small to
handle typical enterprise codebases, meaning coding tools need
sophisticated "context stack" architectures with repository overviews,
semantic search, and enterprise integrations. Context is like CPU
time, a scarce resource that requires careful allocation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENAI MAKES A PLAY FOR HEALTHCARE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI has added Nate Gross, co-founder and former chief strategy
officer of healthcare business networking tool Doximity, and Ashley
Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to its healthcare
AI team. Gross will lead OpenAI's go-to-market strategy in healthcare,
and Alexander will act as vice-president of product in the health
business. The health team is aimed at building tech for individual
consumers and clinicians. AI has the potential to help, or even
revolutionize, the healthcare system, but there are still many
problems to address before that can happen safely. 

 RESEARCHERS ARE ALREADY LEAVING META'S NEW SUPERINTELLIGENCE LAB (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 At least three of the staff who recently joined Meta during Mark
Zuckerberg's recruiting blitz have already resigned. Avi Verma and
Ethan Knight have returned to OpenAI, where they previously worked. It
is unclear what Rishabh Agarwal plans to do next. Chaya Nayak, the
director of generative AI product management at Meta, who has worked
at Meta for nearly a decade, is leaving the company to join OpenAI to
work on special initiatives.
