 MARK ZUCKERBERG‚ÄôS NEW GOAL IS CREATING AGI (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, is entering the race to develop
artificial general intelligence (AGI), aiming to enhance Meta's apps
and user experience. He emphasizes the need for AI talent and
computing power and is considering an open-source approach to AI
development, contrasting with the more closed methods of other
companies.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FOUNDATIONS OF VECTOR RETRIEVAL (2 HOUR READ) [7] 

 This massive document outlines essentially everything one would need
to know about the state of the vector retrieval field. It is a
valuable resource that will take some time to dig through. 

 PRETRAINING OF LARGE IMAGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple has released a great paper on pretraining image models with an
autoregressive loss. It measures scaling behavior and finds that like
in language, these large unsupervised image models have very
predictable behavior. 

 TEXT-TO-IMAGE EDITING (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper improves how images are edited using natural language
instructions by tackling challenges like unclear instructions and
identifying specific parts of the image to edit.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 üÜï¬†MOCKGPT: SIMULATE THE OPENAI API FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Developing against OpenAI APIs can be finicky and expensive. MockGPT
by WireMock [10] is a readymade mock API for ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, etc.
Use it to write and test your code without fees and frustrating wait
times ‚Äî and switch one line of code to go live with the real API.

 3D OBJECT PLACEMENT IN IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Compose and Conquer introduces a conditional diffusion model that
excels in placing objects in three-dimensional space within generated
images. 

 MINUTE-LEVEL VIDEO BLOG CREATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Vlogger is an advanced AI system capable of generating minute-long
video blogs (vlogs) from user descriptions. Vlogger operates in four
stages - Script, Actor, ShowMaker, and Voicer, each representing a
specific aspect of vlog creation. 

 INSTANCE SEGMENTATION FOR NOVEL OBJECTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project evaluates the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models for instance segmentation to novel objects.

MISCELLANEOUS

 8BIT HIPPO ATTENTION MAY BE 3X FASTER THAN FLASH ATTENTION V2 (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A quantization-aware attention alternative that speeds up inference
substantially over some state-of-the-art implementations. Its creators
also claim 700 TFLOPs on MI-300X. The details are sparse, but it would
be quite an achievement if so. 

 MEGA DOLPHIN PASS THROUGH MERGE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Dolphin is widely considered to be one of the strongest uncensored
open models available. It is mainly built on Mixtral. This 120B model
was made by merging two smaller Dolphin models together. It has been
found, with Goliath 120B, that this merging process can improve
overall model performance. 

 NEW BENCHMARK FOR CODE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 TACO is a new benchmark for assessing a system‚Äôs ability to
generate code. It is substantially larger than existing datasets and
contains more challenging problems. On easy problems, GPT-4 gets 30%
correct, while it only achieves 2% on the hardest subset of questions.
