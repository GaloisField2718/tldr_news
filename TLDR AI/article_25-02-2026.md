 SPEAK NATURALLY INTO CURSOR, CLAUDE CODE, OR CHATGPT WITH WISPR FLOW
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The voice layer 100,000+ developers use daily just launched on
Android. Now it's on every platform.

Wispr Flow [4] cleans your speech and outputs ready-to-send text. 89%
sent with zero edits. 

🎙️That means you can give coding agents 10x more context by
talking instead of typing.

Flow [4] understands code syntax and technical terms, which is why
it's used by teams at OpenAI, Vercel, and Clay.

Available on Mac, Windows, iPhone, and now Android.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC UPDATES CLAUDE COWORK TOOL BUILT TO GIVE THE AVERAGE OFFICE
WORKER A PRODUCTIVITY BOOST (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's Claude Cowork is getting a wider release. Anthropic
launched a series of connectors and plugins for the knowledge worker
tool earlier this week aimed at 'turbo-charging' the capabilities of
individual employees. The update marks the tool's transition into a
true enterprise-grade product. Organizations can now connect Claude
Cowork to tools like Google Drive, Gmail, DocuSign, and FactSet. They
can also deploy customizable plugins that encode institutional
knowledge and workflows. 

 ANTHROPIC DIALS BACK AI SAFETY COMMITMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is softening its core safety policy to stay competitive
with other AI labs. The company previously paused development work on
its model if it could be classified as dangerous, but it will end that
practice if a comparable or superior model is released by a
competitor. Anthropic faces intense competition with rivals that
regularly release cutting-edge tools. The change in policy is
unrelated to Anthropic's battle with the Defense Department over how
its Claude tools should be used. 

 KILO LAUNCHES KILOCLAW, ALLOWING ANYONE TO DEPLOY OPENCLAW AGENTS IN
PRODUCTION IN 60 SECONDS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 KiloClaw enables users to deploy OpenClaw agents in under 60 seconds
without dealing with complex infrastructure setup. The service runs on
Fly.io's multi-tenant VMs, offering robust security and persistent
"always-on" capabilities with built-in monitoring. It integrates with
the Kilo Gateway, offering access to over 500 models, and includes an
innovative benchmarking tool, PinchBench, to optimize model selection
for real-world tasks. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 INTELLIGENCE YIELD (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Everyone focuses on how hard a task can models solve. Benchmark data
also captures how much work models need to get there. Opus 4.6 solves
harder tasks, more reliably, with considerably less compute. The post
contains charts comparing models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. 

 AGENTS ARE NOT THINKING, THEY ARE SEARCHING 🔗 (28 MINUTE READ) [9]


 A lot of mysticism has built up around AI. The underlying technology
is non-deterministic. This post provides a framework that creates as
much determinism as possible despite that. AI models are searching
toward a reward signal, and the environments they are in bound that
search. Instead of trying to give models perfect instructions, focus
on bounding their environments tightly enough that the search
converges. 

 CITRINI'S SCENARIO IS A GREAT BUT DEEPLY FLAWED THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
(36 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A recent viral essay about how AI's bullishness could be bearish is
full of flaws and just a work of speculative fiction. It posits that
AI's success will be bad for the economy rather than good. However,
the reality is that the technology will create more opportunity in the
market rather than destroy it. There may be transitional pains, but
there probably won't be any unsolvable problems.

 QWEN3.5-35B-A3B (HUGGING FACE REPO) [12] 

 Qwen3.5 integrates breakthroughs in multimodal learning,
architectural efficiency, reinforcement learning scale, and global
accessibility to deliver exceptional utility and performance. It
features a unified vision-language foundation, an efficient hybrid
architecture, scalable RL generalization, global linguisting coverage,
and next-generation training infrastructure. Qwen3.5 natively supports
context lengths of up to 262,144 tokens. This repository contains
model weights and configuration files for the post-trained model in
the Hugging Face Transformers format. 

 SECURITY BOUNDARIES IN AGENTIC ARCHITECTURES (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Agentic systems risk security breaches when agents execute generated
code without proper boundaries. These systems should separate agent
compute from generated code to prevent access to sensitive secrets.
Combining isolated sandboxes with secret injection proxies enhances
security by preventing credential theft or misuse during execution. 

 VERY BIG VIDEO REASONING DATASET AND BENCHMARK (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The VBVR suite introduced over one million video clips across 200
structured reasoning tasks to support large-scale research in video
reasoning. It also included VBVR-Bench, a rule-based and human-aligned
evaluation framework designed for reproducible assessment and scaling
studies.

 HEAD OF AMAZON'S AGI LAB IS LEAVING THE COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 David Luan, head of Amazon's AGI lab, is leaving the company after
less than two years. He was hired through an acqui-hire of his
startup, Adept, leading efforts like the Nova frontier model to
compete with major AI models. His departure follows a reorganization
of Amazon's AGI division under cloud unit executive Peter DeSantis. 

 META AND AMD PARTNER FOR LONGTERM AI INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta has partnered with AMD in a multi-year agreement to enhance AI
infrastructure with up to 6GW of AMD Instinct GPUs. This collaboration
focuses on vertical integration across silicon, systems, and software,
aligning roadmaps for scalable AI deployments. Shipments for the first
GPU deployments will begin in late 2026, leveraging AMD's Helios
rack-scale architecture for enhanced compute power.
