 BUILDING IN THE AGE OF AI: STARTUP LESSONS FOR EARLY-STAGE GROWTH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey
of building an early-stage startup [4] has never been more
dynamic—or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market
fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological
innovations?

Join on January 14 at 3pm PT [4] for a fireside chat with Christina
Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The
Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the
modern startup founder.

Eric and Christina will discuss:

 	* Learnings from their own experiences
 	* How the principles of “founder mode” and lean methodology
intersect
 	* The ways that today's AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage
growth and startup success

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 1-800-CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 For day 10, OpenAI has released free voice mode and texting via
WhatsApp for a limited number of minutes per month. It operates
globally and uses the Advanced Voice Mode API. 

 GITHUB COPILOT NOW FREE FOR VS CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GitHub has made Copilot free to use within Visual Studio Code,
democratizing AI-powered coding assistance for developers. 

 THE SECOND GEMINI (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has released Gemini Flash 2.0, which features capabilities
like deep research, a real-time multimodal API, and a functional code
interpreter. Alongside, projects like Astra, Mariner, and Jules are in
experimental stages, focusing on universal AI assistance, web
reasoning, and code automation, respectively. While Google introduces
these innovations, clear communication on capabilities remains an area
for improvement.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ALIGNMENT FAKING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Interesting research from Anthropic and Redwood that explores what
models do if they know they are being aligned. Interestingly, they
show alignment while still maintaining their original preferences.
This is helpful to show holes in existing alignment methods. 

 ARE YOUR LLMS CAPABLE OF STABLE REASONING? (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reasoning is a huge opportunity for models, especially for critical
applications like real world deployment. However, benchmarks that are
meant to test reasoning ability don't show how stable a model is
across novel tasks. This paper introduces a new benchmark called
G-Pass@k which evaluates a model's peak and stable reasoning ability. 

 FACTORIZING TRANSFORMERS FOR LINEAR TIME INFERENCE (14 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This paper introduces a new transformer design that achieves linear
time complexity during inference by factorizing the attention
mechanism, reducing computational costs while maintaining model
performance.
