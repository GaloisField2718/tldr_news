HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE IN TALKS TO INVEST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS INTO CHARACTER.AI (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google is in talks to deepen its relationships with Character.AI by
investing hundreds of millions of dollars. 

 ZAPIER AI ACTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Zapier introduced AI Actions, a tool for developers to let any AI
platform run Zapier's 20,000+ automation actions. AI Actions works by
letting users send natural language commands to the AI platform, which
then performs the desired action. The service supports several AI
platforms, with simple setup and inherent API integrations. 

 INTRODUCING AI TO FIGJAM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma has incorporated AI assistance into FigJam, its digital
whiteboard tool, to simplify and enhance design collaborations.
Utility-oriented enhancements, like those derived from the AI-powered
project Jambot, help users collaborate more effectively on a virtual
canvas. Figma‚Äôs goal is to broaden the applicability across various
user requirements by tapping machine learning capabilities for visual
design.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEP DIVE: ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON LANGUAGE MODELS (24 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This blog post is about different attacks that are emerging against
language model systems. It contains excellent information about
different types of attacks and some mitigations that teams have found
to be effective. 

 STYLIZATION OF 3D MESHES USING 2D DIFFUSION MODELS (16 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This research presents the 3DStyle-Diffusion model, a novel approach
for detailed stylization of 3D meshes, integrating 2D Diffusion models
for added control over appearance and geometry. It works by first
parameterizing a 3D mesh's texture into reflectance and lighting,
using implicit MLP networks, and then using a pre-trained 2D Diffusion
model to align the rendered images with the text prompt and ensure
geometric consistency. 

 ENHANCING AUDIO-VISUAL MODELS WITH A NEW ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO) [10]


 This project introduces the Dual-Guided Spatial-Channel-Temporal
(DG-SCT) attention mechanism that enhances pre-trained audio-visual
models for multi-modal tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BUILDING TRUSTWORTHY AI THROUGH SYSTEMATIC TESTING (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Rigorous unit testing for ML models [11] increases trust in your
AI/ML systems, and enables deeper insights into model performance in a
fraction of the time.
Discover how it‚Äôs done in this upcoming webinar by Kolena [11].
You‚Äôll learn how to design a model quality management process;
standardize test coverage; and deal with robustness, fairness, and
biases. RSVP to watch live or get the recording after the session [11]

 HUGGINGFACE ALIGNMENT HANDBOOK (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 With the recent release of the excellent Zephyr language model, the
HuggingFace team showcases how you can train personalized models built
on top of the few powerful pre-trained open source models available. 

 AUDIO SUPER RESOLUTION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Audio super-resolution is the process of increasing the quality and
fidelity of any audio, real or synthetic. Most super-resolution
systems are task-specific, with single models trained for single audio
data types (e.g., speech vs music). This new work is an amazing step
forward where a single model can serve to increase the quality of
audio across tasks. 

 TOOLKIT FOR WEB AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 With the advent of powerful new vision models, many groups are
attempting to build agents that use vision to interact with web
elements. Tarsier toolkit introduces a standard set of tools (e.g.,
element tagging). You can use any vision system to understand the web
page and take action. It also includes utilities for non-vision
language models to browse.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXTRA FAST TEXT-TO-SPEECH GENERATION (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK) [15] 

 An example of using Bark text-to-speech system to generate coherent,
fast, and extra-long audio output. 

 LLAVA PLUS MODEL FOR LANGUAGE-VISION SKILL ACQUISITION (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The LLaVa model is an open-source model that combines both language
and vision. This new version allows the instruction-tuned model to use
tools for image editing, generation, and more. 

 RUN LOCAL AI TOWN WITH RWKV (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 AI town is an amazing experiment where hundreds of agents live out
their daily lives as a prompt state in a language model. The RWKV
model is a linear language model that requires fewer resources than
standard Transformers. This repo uses this cheaper model to run AI
town on your local machine.
