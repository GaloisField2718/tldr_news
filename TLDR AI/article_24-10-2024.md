HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SIMPLIFYING, STABILIZING, AND SCALING CONSISTENCY MODELS (12 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released some work discussing improvements to consistency
models (which generate in two steps as opposed to 1,000 for
diffusion). They still rely on distillation from an existing diffusion
model, but this work aims to improve and stabilize them as they scale.


 DEEPMIND OPEN SOURCES SYNTHID (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SynthID is a way to statistically watermark generated text. It uses a
pseudorandom function after top-k and top-p in the sampling process to
mark text. Then you can use a probabilistic bayesian method to detect
if text has been watermarked - meaning it was generated by a language
model. 

 TRANSFORMERS JS V3 (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Transformers JS is a JavaScript library for running models. It now
uses WebGPU, which is up to 1,000x faster in some cases. The new
version has 1,200+ models ready to use for edge and browser-based
applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ALL YOU NEED ARE 32 TOKENS TO REPRESENT VIDEO (27 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Salesforce's new method uses a novel encoder for video that requires
substantially fewer tokens for proper representation. This has been
tried a number of times in the past with minimal success, the key
seems to be an explicit temporal encoder along with a spatial encoder.


 PANGEA OPEN MULTILINGUAL MODELS (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A team at CMU has released powerful open models with strong
performance in a variety of languages.

 SABOTAGE EVALUATIONS FOR FRONTIER MODELS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's Alignment Science team developed evaluations to test AI
models' potential for sabotage, including human decision sabotage,
code sabotage, sandbagging, and undermining oversight. These
evaluations aim to identify dangerous capabilities in future AI
systems and inform necessary safety mitigations. Their findings
suggest minimal risks with current models but highlight the need for
more robust evaluations and safeguards as AI capabilities advance. 

 AI DREAMS: MICROSOFT @ 50, CHAPTER 1 (23 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft's research paper on AI robustness prompted the company to
invest billions in AI infrastructure, catalyzing breakthroughs with
partners like OpenAI. This investment has significantly boosted
Microsoft's growth in AI-driven products, exemplified by GitHub
Copilot's success. Despite challenges from competition and
sustainability goals, Microsoft continues to prioritize AI, with
record capital spending on its AI and cloud infrastructure.
