 CHINESE DEVELOPERS SCRAMBLE AS OPENAI BLOCKS ACCESS IN CHINA (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chinese attempts to lure domestic developers away from OpenAI will
now be a lot easier as OpenAI has blocked users in China from
accessing its tools and services. The tool was already blocked through
the government's firewall, but developers were previously still able
to use virtual private networks to access OpenAI's tools. OpenAI has
not elaborated on the reason for its sudden decision. The decision may
result in an acceleration of development by Chinese AI companies.
