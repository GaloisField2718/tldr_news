GRETEL TRAINED AN LLM ON 500BN TOKENS OF PUBLIC TABULAR DATASETS TO
GENERATE BETTER SYNTHETIC DATA (SPONSOR) [https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k] 

Gretel's novel tabular large language model [https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k]
reliably generates synthetic tabular data with zero-shot prompting
[https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k]. You can use it to¬†create a new correlated
dataset [https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k] with the correct datatypes, based on
an SQL schema or query; or to expand existing datasets
[https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k] by automatically adding columns and records,
or filling in gaps and null values.
The LLM was trained on half a trillion tokens of public data and
generates highly realistic tables [https://bit.ly/3Q19s6k] while
ensuring relationships between records remain consistent. It‚Äôs even
aware of regional differences (company names, emails, etc.) Request

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

VISION TRANSFORMERS NEED REGISTERS (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588?utm_source=tldrai] 

One of the coolest and simplest vision papers in recent weeks. Vision
Transformers use "useless" pixel values as places to store global
information. This makes attention maps uninterpretable. However, if
you add a simple [reg] token to the vocabulary, the model will use it
and won't store information in pixel values. 

TRANSFORMER-VQ: EFFICIENT LINEAR-TIME ATTENTION (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16354v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study presents Transformer-VQ, a new design of transformer that
processes attention faster thanks to unique vector-based keys and
caching. 

IDENTIFYING REAL VS FAKE FACES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://koushiksrivats.github.io/FLIP/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study uses visual and language-based tools to improve how systems
recognize real vs. fake faces.
