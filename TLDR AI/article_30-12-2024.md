HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHATGPT SEARCH VS. GOOGLE: A DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS OF 62 QUERIES (25
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A study analyzing 62 queries compared ChatGPT search and Google,
highlighting strengths and weaknesses. Google led in informational,
local, and commercial queries, while ChatGPT search showed promise in
content gap analysis and disambiguation tasks. Both platforms had
issues with errors, omissions, and incomplete responses, but Google
generally provided more reliable search results. 

 6G-AI MASHUPS WILL RESHAPE THE TELECOM INDUSTRY (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The EU-U.S. 6G-XCEL project and joint efforts like ACCoRD and COSMOS
are advancing 6G research through collaborations on AI-integrated
network architectures. Workshops at Rutgers highlighted innovations in
6G technology and emphasized open-source initiatives and industry
partnerships. These initiatives aim to accelerate progress and create
interoperability frameworks for the next generation of wireless
networks. 

 WHY GOOGLE BOUGHT CHARACTER AI (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google acquired Character AI primarily for its cost-effective
inference technology, which enabled scalable AI interactions. This
efficiency allows Google to offer AI models for free via AI Studio
without harming unit economics. The acquisition complements the trend
toward inference-time optimizations as pre-training returns diminish.

 FAST LLM INFERENCE FROM SCRATCH (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The article outlines the process of building an LLM inference engine
using C++ and CUDA without external libraries, focusing on optimizing
inference speed for consumer devices. It explores techniques like
multithreading, vectorization, warp reductions, coalescing, and
quantization to maximize performance and successfully surpass
llama.cpp's throughput in specific scenarios. Additionally, the piece
discusses potential for further optimization and the advantages of
using established libraries for production-grade implementations. 

 COMPUTING INSIDE AN AI (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Shifting from a model-as-person to a model-as-computer metaphor could
enhance AI usefulness by enabling graphical interfaces and direct
manipulation, rather than relying on slow conversational inputs. This
new interaction paradigm could allow users to engage with AI like a
dynamic, customizable app, offering more efficient and versatile
functionality. Generative interfaces could eventually transform
computing, allowing users to modify and create applications on demand
for specific tasks.
