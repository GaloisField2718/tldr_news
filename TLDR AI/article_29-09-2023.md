When incredibly valuable assets come up for sale, it's typically the
wealthiest that end up taking home an amazing investment. But not
always...
One platform is taking on the billionaires at their own game,
fractionalizing prized blue-chip artworks for its investors. In just
the last few years, its investors have realized annualized net returns
of 17.8%, 21.5%, 35%

and more.

It's called Masterworks

When Masterworks sells a painting ‚Äì like the 16 it's already sold
‚Äì investors reap their portion of the profits.

HOW IS AI GOING TO IMPACT THE SAAS LANDSCAPE OVER THE COMING YEARS
WITH A16Z GP KRISTINA SHEN (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.saastr.com/how-is-ai-going-to-impact-the-saas-landscape-over-the-coming-years-with-a16z-gp-kristina-shen/?utm_source=tldrai]

We all know SaaS is going to be impacted by AI but the question is
what is the next wave going to look like? This in-depth discussion
with Kristina Shen goes into why it‚Äôs more about insights than
information and unlocking the real power of AI for SaaS. 

NEW FORETHOUGHT TOOL LETS YOU BUILD WORKFLOWS WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/new-forethought-tool-lets-you-build-workflows-with-natural-language/?utm_source=tldrai]

Forethought unveils "Autoflows", a new AI-driven system for customer
service tasks that goes beyond simple Q&A. Using natural language
prompts, Autoflows determines steps and tasks across systems,
differing from traditional no-code workflows. Powered by SupportGPT,
which is based on OpenAI models, the system blends automation and
human oversight.

META'S TEXT TO IMAGE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/emu-enhancing-image-generation-models-using-photogenic-needles-in-a-haystack/?utm_source=tldrai]

Pre-trained on 1.1B image pairs and fine-tuned on just a few thousand
highly curated images, Emu image generation outperforms SDXL in user
preference surveys. It acts as the backbone to much of Meta‚Äôs new AI
assistant play. 

SIMPLIFYING VQ-VAE (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15505?utm_source=tldrai]

VectorQuantized-VAEs are typically the state of the art when trying to
learn a specific discrete representation (e.g., tokens or codes).
However, they are usually complex and fragile. This new paper proposes
a simple quantization scheme that eliminates codebook collapse and
complicated machinery such as commitment losses, codebook reseeding,
code splitting, entropy penalties, etc. 

JOINTLY TRAINING LARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15564?utm_source=tldrai]

Models are usually trained separately on specific tasks (e.g.,
language vs image generation). The newly proposed joint autoregressive
mixture (JAM) algorithm combines disparate models with a clever
interleaved cross attention and gentle fine-tuning achieves dominant
performance in many multimodal tasks.
