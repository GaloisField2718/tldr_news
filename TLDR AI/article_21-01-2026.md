 DEEPMIND CEO SAYS CHINESE AI FIRMS ARE 6 MONTHS BEHIND THE WEST (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google DeepMind's CEO, Demis Hassabis, says that Chinese AI companies
remain around six months behind the frontier AI of the leading Western
labs. He says the response to DeepSeek's R1 model last year was a
massive overreaction and that while Chinese firms are very good at
catching up to the frontier, they have yet to show they can innovate
beyond that. Some of the barriers to Chinese AI development are set to
come down as the Trump administration is easing a ban on advanced AI
chip exports to China. Sales of the most advanced AI processors will
remain blocked on national security grounds. 

 GEMINI IN CHROME IS GETTING “SKILLS” AS IT MOVES TOWARD BECOMING
A FULL AI AGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini in Chrome is being upgraded into a proactive agent capable of
performing complex tasks on users' behalf. A hidden internal page for
'skills' has been spotted in testing. The page features a dedicated
interface where users can define specific capabilities for the AI.
Skills will effectively allow users to 'teach' Gemini how to handle
specific or repetitive workflows within the browser. 

 THE MESSY HUMAN DRAMA THAT DEALT A BLOW TO ONE OF AI'S HOTTEST
STARTUPS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mira Murati says that Barret Zoph was fired from Thinking Machines
Lab after repeated concerns about his conduct and lack of
productivity. Zoph claims he was fired for expressing an intent to
take a job elsewhere. Within hours of Zoph's firing, Zoph, another
co-founder, and a third employee had signed offers to rejoin OpenAI.
The departures are a sign of how the AI race is as much a battle for
talent as technology. 

 AI STARTUP HUMANS& RAISES $480 MILLION AT $4.5 BILLION VALUATION IN
SEED ROUND (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI startup Humans& has secured $480 million in seed funding, reaching
a $4.5 billion valuation. Key participants included Nvidia, Jeff
Bezos, and GV. The company aims to develop human-centric AI for
improved communication and collaboration. A product launch is expected
early this year. The founding team consists of experts from OpenAI,
Google DeepMind, and Meta.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WITHOUT BENCHMARKING LLMS, YOU'RE LIKELY OVERPAYING 5-10X (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Those paying for LLM APIs and have never tested alternatives are
likely overpaying. There are almost always cheaper options with
comparable quality for every workflow. Benchmarking and finding an
optimal model is a complex process, but it can result in significant
savings. This post discusses how one team navigated the process to
save thousands of dollars. 

 THE TRAGEDY OF THE AGENTIC COMMONS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents can improve matching markets, like dating or job searches,
by using LLMs to convert unstructured preferences into actionable
data, outperforming standard questionnaires. However, in markets where
everyone uses AI agents, congestion increases significantly, reducing
efficiency without a pricing mechanism. Introducing prices and
institutional design can alleviate congestion, streamline
coordination, and enhance market efficiency. 

 MY AGENTS ARE WORKING. ARE YOURS? (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI agents are significantly increasing productivity by automating the
analysis of thousands of research papers. A new anti-AI tool, Poison
Fountain, corrupts AI training data to combat the perceived threat of
machine intelligence.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 INWORLD RELEASES NEW TTS MODEL DESIGNED FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF CONSUMER
AI APPLICATIONS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Inworld released TTS-1.5, building on their #1-ranked position on the
Artificial Analysis leaderboard. The new model achieves sub-250ms P90
latency, enabling natural conversation at thousands of queries per
second. With 30% greater expressiveness, 40% lower word error rates,
and 25x lower cost than alternatives, TTS-1.5 is designed for
developers building high-demand, realtime applications at consumer
scale.

 INTRODUCING FASTMCP 3.0 🚀 (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 FastMCP 3.0 was built to be as durable as it is future-proof. It
moves beyond simple tool servers and enters the era of Context
Applications: rich, adaptive systems that manage the information flow
to agents. FastMCP 3.0 can source components from anywhere, compose
and transform them freely, personalize what each user sees, track
state across sessions, and more. The first beta is available now. 

 REPO: CONTENT-AWARE ATTENTION REORDERING (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 RePo is a module that repositions tokens based on contextual
relevance rather than fixed order, improving long-range attention and
robustness to noisy or structured inputs. The method draws on
Cognitive Load Theory to justify reorganizing input structure for more
efficient model processing. 

 DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMER V2 (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DIFF V2 features key upgrades over DIFF V1: faster inference via
compatibility with FlashAttention, better training stability by
removing per-head RMSNorm, and a simplified λ parameterization that
eliminates complex initialization schemes. 

 WAYPOINT-1: REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE VIDEO DIFFUSION FROM OVERWORLD (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Waypoint-1 is a real-time-interactive video diffusion model. It can
be controlled and prompted via text, mouse, and keyboard. Users can
give the model some frames, run it, then have it create a world that
they can interact with. They can move the camera freely with the mouse
and input any key on the keyboard, all with zero latency. Each frame
is generated with the controls as context. The model runs fast enough
to provide a seamless experience, even on consumer hardware.

 AI GAINS STARTING TO SHOW IN THE REAL ECONOMY (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The introduction of AI tools like Claude Cowork and Alibaba's Qwen
Assistant marks a shift towards AI's real-world applications, similar
to ChatGPT's accessibility impact. Recent data from Q3 2025 shows a
4.9% productivity jump, with minimal change in hours worked,
indicating potential initial AI-driven efficiency gains. Despite
early-stage adoption, these developments could significantly boost
economic productivity and eventually increase living standards. 

 ANTHROPIC CEO: SELLING H200S TO CHINA IS LIKE GIVING NUKES TO NORTH
KOREA (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has likened the decision to allow Nvidia
to sell GPUs to Chinese companies to giving nuclear weapons to an
adversary. The Trump administration announced just over a month ago
that it would allow shipments of Nvidia H200 accelerators to Chinese
customers as long as the US received 25% of the revenues. Chinese
authorities have yet to allow local buyers to acquire the GPUs.
Anthropic wants stricter controls on AI exports, saying access to the
chips would put Chinese model developers in a better position to
compete with the West.
