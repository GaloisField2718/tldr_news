HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

AI AND THE MEMORY WALL (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://medium.com/riselab/ai-and-memory-wall-2cb4265cb0b8?utm_source=tldrai]

The rise of LLaMA.cpp was surprising to many. Why can an ordinary
MacBook run state-of-the-art models only a bit slower than a mighty
A100? The answer is that when you're only doing a single batch, one
token at a time, memory bandwidth is the bottleneck and the gap
between the M2's memory bandwidth and the A100's is not that large. 

GOOGLE UPGRADES SEARCH GENERATION EXPERIENCE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/15/googles-ai-search-experience-adds-ai-powered-summaries-definitions-and-coding-improvements/?utm_source=tldrai]

Google is rolling out a few new updates to its Search Generative
Experience, the company‚Äôs AI-powered Search. These updates include
automatic term definitions, programming assistance, and AI-generated
summaries. 

IBM AND NASA OPEN SOURCE LARGEST GEOSPATIAL AI FOUNDATION MODEL ON
HUGGING FACE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-03-IBM-and-NASA-Open-Source-Largest-Geospatial-AI-Foundation-Model-on-Hugging-Face?utm_source=tldrai]

IBM and Hugging Face are releasing IBM's geospatial foundation model,
crafted using NASA satellite data, to the public. Built through a
collaboration with NASA, this model aims to democratize AI's role in
climate science and Earth studies, addressing the challenges of
handling large environmental datasets. The model has already shown a
15% improvement in satellite data analysis and can be adapted for
various tasks like tracking deforestation and monitoring greenhouse
gasses.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

BAYESIAN FLOW NETWORKS (32 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037?utm_source=tldrai]

Unifying the modeling of discrete or continuous data is a challenge.
More so when attempting to maintain a probabilistic likelihood
interpretation of the output. This new paper showcases a new class of
generative models with a pile of interesting properties such as no
forward pass, gradient-based sample guidance for discrete data, and
competitive language modeling likelihood. 

INSTRUCTION TUNING LARGE CODE MODELS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/bigcode-project/octopack?utm_source=tldrai]

Most code models are instruction tuned on GPT-4 distillation data.
This new work shows how to avoid that, introduces an extended human
eval dataset, and gets 46.7 on the original human eval. While this is
impressive, it showcases the extreme gap between closed and open code
models. 

ENHANCED VIRTUAL TRY-ON WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06101v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Virtual try-on tasks, where clothes from one image are transferred to
another, are challenging, especially at higher resolutions. Many
methods use Generative Adversarial Networks. The solution presented in
this paper, DCI-VTON, uses a diffusion model combined with an
exemplar-based inpainting and a warping module. This combination
ensures that clothing details are preserved and produces realistic
virtual try-on images.

INTRODUCING DOCTORGPT, AN OPEN SOURCE AI DOCTOR (38 MINUTE VIDEO)
[https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1690428315235151872?utm_source=tldrai]

DoctorGPT is an LLM that can pass the US Medical Licensing Exam. It
works offline, it's cross-platform, and keeps health data private. 

ADVANCED FOOD IMAGE SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jamesjg/foodsam?utm_source=tldrai]

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels in segmentation tasks
across various datasets, it misses specific class details for masks.
FoodSAM overcomes this. It combines SAM's strengths with new features
to segment food images more effectively, even identifying individual
food items and other objects in scenes. 

OPENDREAM (GITHUB REPO)

OpenDream brings layering, non-destructive editing, portability, and
easy-to-write extensions to your Stable Diffusion workflow.

A GUIDE TO DESIGNING AND SHIPPING AI DEVELOPER TOOLS (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.blog/2023-08-08-a-guide-to-designing-and-shipping-ai-developer-tools/?utm_source=tldrai]

This article outlines ten key design principles for effective AI
developer tools, drawing from GitHub‚Äôs experience designing,
launching, and extending Copilot. They encompass leveraging natural
language, addressing developer pain points, gathering meaningful
feedback, acknowledging biases, and prioritizing customization,
accessibility, performance, and continuous improvement in AI models. 

CAN CHATGPT BECOME A CONTENT MODERATOR? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.semafor.com/article/08/15/2023/can-chatgpt-become-a-content-moderator?utm_source=tldrai]

ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been using its most advanced large language
model to enforce the company‚Äôs content policies. 

HUMAN CREATIVITY AMONGST AI DOMINANCE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/human-creativity-amidst-ai-dominance/?utm_source=tldrai]

More marketers and content producers are turning to AI for efficiency.
Over time, this will lead to a level of genericism in the market. The
antidote will be authentic human production.
