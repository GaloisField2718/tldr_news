HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK RELEASES MINOR UPDATE TO R1 REASONING MODEL (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 DeepSeek released a “trial” update to R1 on Hugging Face without
providing any details on the new version. The update came just hours
before Nvidia's Q1 earnings report. 

 MISTRAL'S CODE EMBEDDINGS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mistral's Codestral Embed is a new code-focused embedding model that
surpasses top alternatives in retrieval benchmarks. It offers
customizable dimensions and precision levels for optimized
storage-performance trade-offs. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG SAYS META AI HAS 1 BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta's artificial intelligence assistant has one billion monthly
active users across the company's family of apps. The company recently
released a stand-alone app for the tool. It plans to keep growing the
product before building a business around it. There will be
opportunities to either insert paid recommendations or offer a
subscription service.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 YOU COULD'VE INVENTED TRANSFORMERS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The fundamental architecture of LLMs can be explained as a series of
straightforward steps, starting from n-grams' 0-count problem through
embeddings, neural LMs, and self-attention. Transformers are
sophisticated, but obvious in retrospect—heavily tweaked MLPs that
solve RNNs' information propagation problems. 

 STRUCTURED CODEAGENTS FOR SMARTER EXECUTION (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Hugging Face has proposed combining structured generation with
code-based actions, showing that structured JSON outputs can help
CodeAgents outperform traditional methods in benchmark tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 HOW CINESHARE IS BUILDING REAL-TIME DIGITAL AVATARS WITH DELL AI
WORKSTATIONS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Finnish studio Cineshare is rethinking AI-driven character animation.
With Dell Precision workstations and NVIDIA RTX GPUs [13], they hit
120 FPS using subsurface scattering in NVIDIA Omniverse—no separate
VMs needed. Now they're running Llama models locally to gain full
control of AI processing. Read more on the Dell blog [13]. 

 PAINTING WITH CONCEPTS USING DIFFUSION MODEL LATENTS (11 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Goodfire's Paint With Ember is a tool that lets users directly
manipulate the neural activations of image models by painting simple
pixel images instead of using text prompts. The tool uses sparse
autoencoders to decode Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo's internal features
into interpretable visual concepts, allowing direct access to the
model's "brain." 

 RANDOM REWARDS DURING RL BOOST MATH REASONING IN SOME LLMS (21 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Qwen2.5-Math models achieve 15-24% performance gains using completely
spurious rewards like random feedback, incorrect answers, or
formatting requirements—nearly matching traditional RL methods.
However, this phenomenon was only observed on Qwen models due to their
pre-existing code reasoning capabilities, while other model families
like Llama3 and OLMo2 show minimal or negative effects. 

 PIXELFLOW (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 PixelFlow models generate images directly in pixel space without
VAEs, offering strong image quality and semantic control with
competitive efficiency and benchmark results.

 ANTHROPIC CEO WARNS AI COULD ELIMINATE HALF OF WHITE-COLLAR JOBS
WITHIN 5 YEARS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Dario Amodei predicts AI could wipe out half of all entry-level
white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to 10-20% in the next five
years. He believes AI labs have an obligation to warn the public about
the coming "white-collar bloodbath" across tech, finance, law, and
consulting. 

 US-CHINA AI GAP: 2025 ANALYSIS OF MODEL PERFORMANCE, INVESTMENT, AND
INNOVATION (21 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 China aims to lead AI innovation by 2030 but currently lags behind
the US in key industry pillars, including funding and technology.
While China's AI models may occasionally outperform the US,
restrictions and limited semiconductor capabilities hinder progress.
To remain competitive, the US should monitor Chinese advancements and
protect intellectual property while China continues leveraging
collaborations, open-source models, and government support.
