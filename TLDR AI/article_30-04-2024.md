HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COPILOT WORKSPACE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GitHub has announced a new project to allow language models to
somewhat autonomously finish features and fix bugs. 

 OPENAI INTRODUCES ‚ÄúMEMORY‚Äù FEATURE FOR CHATGPT PLUS USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has launched a new "Memory" feature for ChatGPT Plus users,
allowing the AI to retain information across conversations, which can
be managed via settings. 

 EFFORT ENGINE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Effort enables real-time adjustment of computations during LLM model
inference on Apple Silicon chips, striking a balance between speed and
quality. The method, which requires no retraining but requires
conversion and precomputation, allows models to operate faster by
loading fewer weights. The developers are seeking assistance from
Swift/Metal engineers to optimize the implementation, which is
available for download on GitHub.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OPEN GATO REPLICATION: JAT (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GATO by DeepMind was touted to be a generalist agent. A team
associated with Hugging Face has trained and evaluated JAT, which is a
Jack-of-All-Trades model that performs reasonably on a wide variety of
tasks. 

 FP6-LLM (27 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Reducing floating point precision speeds up training but can be
unstable. This paper shows that you can get full tensor core
utilization in a new packing format without common instabilities or
slowdowns from naive attempts. 

 STAR-CODER 2 15B INSTRUCT (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This model is trained on synthetic and human data. Permissively
licensed, it achieves 72.6 on humaneval. Its developers give great
insights into how to replicate their data pipeline and apply
principles to other problems where synthetic data might be useful.

 WHISPER CPP CLI (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A fully self-contained speech-to-text system built on top of Whisper
by the folks who built Ruff. 

 MEMARY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Memary allows your agents to store a large corpus of information in
knowledge graphs, infer user knowledge through our memory modules, and
only retrieve relevant information for meaningful responses. 

 MISTRAL.RS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A fast LLM inference platform that supports inference on a variety of
devices, quantization, and easy-to-use applications with an OpenAI
API-compatible HTTP server and Python bindings.

MISCELLANEOUS

 JAX INTERNALS (30 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Autodidax tutorial that shows the inner ideas in the growing Jax
framework. It also introduces helpful jargon often used in the
community. 

 AI ISN'T USELESS. BUT IS IT WORTH IT? (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article provides a critical examination of AI and machine
learning, arguing that while AI tools can be useful for certain tasks,
they often fail to live up to the grand promises made by AI companies.
It highlights the significant gap between AI's practical use cases,
like coding assistance and language generation, and the inflated
expectations set by industry narratives. The article raises concerns
about the ethical and environmental costs of AI development, along
with the potential for misuse and overreliance on the technology. 

 BINDING PUBLIC SECTOR AI DIFFUSION (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The OMB's new AI executive order policy aimed at the public sector
could severely impede AI innovation due to stringent safety provisions
and bureaucratic hurdles. Implemented amidst shrinking IT budgets, the
regulations may not only slow AI deployment but also potentially halt
projects crucial for modernizing government services. Critics worry
that these constraints, coupled with funding cuts, could prevent
agencies from keeping pace with technological advances in fields like
healthcare.
