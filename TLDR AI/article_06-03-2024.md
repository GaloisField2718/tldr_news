 OpenAI responded to Elon Musk's lawsuit by sharing its side of the
story along with screenshots of email exchanges between Sam Altman,
Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, and Elon Musk. The receipts show that
Musk believed OpenAI‚Äôs chance of success was 0% and agreed that
there was a need to close source certain models. 

 STABLE DIFFUSION 3: RESEARCH PAPER (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Stable Diffusion 3, with its novel Multimodal Diffusion Transformer
architecture, surpasses leading text-to-image models by enhancing
prompt comprehension and typography through separate processing
weights for text and images, promising advancements in AI-generated
visual content. 

 HOW AI COULD DISRUPT HOLLYWOOD (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora and other platforms are enhancing
video production, potentially streamlining Hollywood's expensive and
complex filmmaking process. These tools raise questions about the
future of creative roles and the industry's ability to adapt to AI's
increasing capabilities in scripting, scoring, and editing films.
Hollywood faces a paradigm shift akin to the music industry's digital
transformation, with a mix of optimism and concern for the impact on
traditional filmmaking.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 RESEARCHY QUESTIONS: A NEW QUESTION ANSWERING DATASET (25 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Language models are now exceptionally skilled at answering questions.
As a result, most existing benchmarks have been saturated. There is a
new type of question, dubbed 'researchy', which is open-ended and
requires multiple steps. This particular dataset is mined from search
engine queries. It contains cases where GPT-4 struggled to answer
queries. 

 BOOSTING TEXT-TO-VIDEO QUALITY WITH UNIVERSAL CONTROL (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 UniCtrl introduces a new approach to enhancing semantic consistency
and motion quality in videos created by text-to-video models. It
improves video realism and coherence without the need for extra
training by using cross-frame self-attention and motion injection
techniques. 

 SEARCHING VIDEOS WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 VTG-GPT offers a novel GPT-based method for accurately identifying
specific segments in videos using natural language queries without the
need for training or fine-tuning.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MOBILECLIP: FAST TEXT AND IMAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 MobileClip runs 7x faster with the same performance as OpenAI‚Äôs
original CLIP model. It can be used on-device for various vision and
language tasks. 

 ORCA MATH DATASET (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [19] 

 Microsoft has released an Orca math word problems dataset. This was
used to train some of the current state-of-the-art math models. It can
now be used for research by the community. 

 TRAINING LLMS IN THE WILDERNESS AS A STARTUP (15 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The founder of Reka and famous GPU critic Yi Tay wrote a blog post
outlining their experience training extremely strong language models
outside of Google. The main challenges come from cluster and hardware
instability. They also found software maturity to be a challenge.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLAUDE 3 IS THE MOST HUMAN AI YET (10 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Anthropic's release of Claude 3, a large language model comparable to
GPT-4, stands out not for its benchmark tests or cost efficiency, but
for its uniquely human-like, creative, and naturalistic interaction
quality, making it a significant advancement in AI's ability to
partner creatively with writers. 

 LICENSING AI MEANS LICENSING THE WHOLE ECONOMY (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Regulating AI like a tangible product is misguided because AI is a
broad process involving statistical methods, and overseeing its use
across all companies would be impractical. Targeted regulation for
specific misuses, similar to existing approaches for programming or
email abuses, is more effective given AI's impending ubiquity in the
economy. 

 EFFICIENT MODEL FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE TASKS (26 MINUTE READ) [23]


 Vision-RWKV adapts the RWKV architecture from NLP to tackle vision
tasks, offering an efficient solution for high-resolution image
processing.
