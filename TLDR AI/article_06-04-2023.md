EFFORTLESSLY CONVERT ML TO OPTIMIZED C++ FOR EDGE DEVICES WITH PYTHON
(SPONSOR)
[https://www.edgeimpulse.com/blog/unveiling-the-new-edge-impulse-python-sdk?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr_ai]


You ML practitioners are the experts when it comes to developing and
training models. But generating models that can deploy to edge devices
remains a challenge.
To remedy that, we've launched the Edge Impulse Python SDK, providing
the long-missing bridge between ML engineers and edge devices.

Access the power of Edge Impulse directly in your dev environment. Get
on-device performance, optimize your model, and export a C++ library
that can be deployed to any edge hardware.¬†

Edge Impulse is used by top enterprises. Now it's easier than ever.¬†

SEGMENT ANYTHING, MAJOR ADVANCE IN IMAGE SEGMENTATION (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.facebook.com/blog/segment-anything-foundation-model-image-segmentation/?utm_source=tldrai]


Image Segmentation is the process of pulling out all the pixels in an
image that represent a certain object (e.g., a person or desk). It is
a hard task for a few reasons, normally it either requires a huge
dataset of predefined objects or some weak supervision. This new,
fully open sourced, model from Meta feels like a leap forward in
capabilities. They collected a massive dataset, made easier annotation
features, and created a model that can run in your browser in
real-time. Demo, code, and paper are available. 

GOOGLE REVEALS ITS NEWEST A.I. SUPERCOMPUTER, SAYS IT BEATS NVIDIA (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/google-reveals-its-newest-ai-supercomputer-claims-it-beats-nvidia-.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Google has developed a TPU-based supercomputer, called TPU v4, which
it claims is 1.2x-1.7x faster and uses 1.3x-1.9x less power than
Nvidia's A100 chips. The system, comprising over 4,000 Tensor
Processing Units (TPUs), has been operational since 2020 and was used
to train Google's PaLM model. The growing power requirements of AI
continue to drive innovation in the chip industry and benefit cloud
providers like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, which rent out
processing power and provide resources to startups.

WHAT HAPPENS TO MODELS AS THEY TRAIN? (33 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01373?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Pythia paper from EleutherAI is finally here! They released
hundreds of checkpoints of Transformer models over time as they train.
This is useful because it is not at all clear what skills models gain
over time, but now the community can inspect the dynamics of training
and gain massive insights into potential areas for improvement and
efficiency. 

A SURVEY OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper discusses the evolution of language modeling for artificial
intelligence algorithms, with a focus on recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. The paper offers a
comprehensive review of LLMs, including pre-training, adaptation
tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation, and provides a useful
resource for researchers and engineers. 

AUDIT: AUDIO EDITING BY FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WITH LATENT DIFFUSION
MODELS (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://audit-demo.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

AUDIT is a new instruction-guided audio editing model based on latent
diffusion models, which can automatically modify only the necessary
audio segments and only requires edit instructions instead of full
target audio descriptions as text input. The proposed model achieved
state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective metrics for
several audio editing tasks, including adding, dropping, replacement,
inpainting, and super-resolution.

This post explains how graph learning methods are utilized at Lyft to
generate embeddings, which are compact vector representations of
high-dimensional information, and how these embeddings can reveal
insights into riders, drivers, locations, and time in the rideshare
industry.

OUR APPROACH TO AI SAFETY (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety?utm_source=tldrai] 

OpenAI is leading the way in capabilities research, they also are a
strong player in developing safety systems for their language models.
They outline a few directions they are tackling such as factuality,
child safety, privacy, and more. They have made progress on all of
these aims and the fact that GPT-4 was finished training 6 months
before its launch, but held back to focus on safety concerns is
interesting. The biggest take away here is that GPT-4 is 40% less
likely to generate factually incorrect output than gpt-3.5-turbo. 

WHERE ARE AI VIDEOS GOING? (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/Q1h1h?utm_source=tldrai] 

AI-generated videos are gaining popularity, often depicting surreal
scenes or celebrity memes. The technology's rapid advancement raises
questions about its potential in Hollywood, such as casting movies or
modeling scenes. Although challenges remain, experts believe AI will
have a significant impact on content creation, but it won't replace
human talent in the film industry anytime soon.
