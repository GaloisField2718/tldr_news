HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

GPT-4 IS EXCITING AND SCARY (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/UDPRi?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses the author's experience testing GPT-4 by asking
it a variety of questions ‚Äî to help with a tax problem, to come up
with a new word, to plan a birthday party. The author found that GPT-4
was capable of a wider range of tasks, more fluid in its responses,
and seemed to have more guardrails in place than its predecessor.
GPT-4 also scored high on a variety of tests, including the Uniform
Bar Exam and the Biology Olympiad. While the article acknowledges the
positive potential of GPT-4, it also discusses the negative side ‚Äî
the thought of AI being smarter than humans, ethical implications of
such technology, and the potential for misuse. Also, another
correction from yesterday‚Äôs newsletter: GPT-4 can take both _IMAGES_
and text as inputs, but not video. Sorry for the brain fart! Maybe I
should have had GPT-4 proofread it :) 

ADEPT AI RAISES $350M IN SERIES B FUNDING (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.adept.ai/blog/series-b?utm_source=tldrai] 

Adept has raised $350M in new funding as part of their Series B led by
General Catalyst and Spark Capital. Adept is a research and product AI
lab that automates software processes for developers. It's similar to
robotic process automation (RPA), or software robots that use a
combination of automation, computer vision, and machine learning to
automate repetitive tasks like filing forms and responding to emails.
Adept is creating general intelligence by allowing humans and
computers to collaborate creatively. 

GOOGLE CLOUD BRINGS GENERATIVE AI TO DEVELOPERS, BUSINESSES, AND
GOVERNMENTS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/generative-ai-for-businesses-and-governments?utm_source=tldrai]


Google Cloud has launched Generative AI support in Vertex AI and
Generative AI App Builder, which enables businesses and governments to
access and customize generative AI technology. These tools allow
developers to create generative AI applications quickly and easily
using out-of-the-box templates and API access to Google's foundation
models, with full control over data usage. This move reflects Google
Cloud's commitment to empowering teams and transforming industries
through AI technology.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM PRIVACY FEEDBACK (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://gretel.ai/blog/teaching-large-language-models-to-zip-their-lips?utm_source=tldrai]


Language models often leak sensitive data. This is undesirable for
many use cases, but hard to avoid due to the next token prediction
training objective. By replacing the human feedback objective in RLHF
with a privacy preserving reward, we are able to tune language models
that leak much less often than their untrained counterparts. 

UPRISE: UNIVERSAL PROMPT RETRIEVAL FOR IMPROVING ZERO-SHOT EVALUATION
IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08518?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper proposes a solution to the challenge of fine-tuning and
task-specific prompt engineering that can limit the generalization
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method,
UPRISE, uses a lightweight and versatile retriever to automatically
retrieve prompts for a given zero-shot task input, and demonstrates
universality in a cross-task and cross-model scenario. The method is
tested on a diverse set of tasks, using a small frozen LLM for tuning
and testing on much larger LLMs, and is shown to mitigate the
hallucination problem in experiments with ChatGPT, suggesting
potential to improve even the strongest LLMs. 

DEEPMIM: DEEP SUPERVISION FOR MASKED IMAGE MODELING (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08817?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces DeepMIM, a deep supervision technique that
significantly boosts the representation capability of each layer in
Vision Transformers for masked image modeling. The results show that
DeepMIM accelerates model convergence, expands attention diversities,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks.

PIP INSTALL PYTORCH 2.0 (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-2.0-release/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Announced in December, this new version of pytorch is now stable and
available for easy installation. With a slew of new features, speed
improvements, and interfaces - it‚Äôs an exciting time to be using the
most popular deep learning framework out there. 

EDIT-A-VIDEO: A TEXT-TO-VIDEO APPROACH FOR VIDEO EDITING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://edit-a-video.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper presents Edit-A-Video, a framework for video editing based
on text-to-video (TTV) models adapted from diffusion-based
text-to-image (TTI) models. The proposed framework inflates the 2D
model into a 3D model, and inverts the source video into the noise to
edit with a target text prompt and attention map injection, while also
mitigating the background inconsistency problem through a novel mask
blending method. Experimental results show the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of background consistency, text alignment,
and video editing quality compared to baselines.

GOOGLE PARTNERS WITH GRETEL TO ADD SYNTHETIC DATA INTO VERTEX AI (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230314005528/en/Gretel-Partners-With-Google-Cloud-to-Harness-the-Power-of-Synthetic-Data-and-Accelerate-Adoption-of-Safer-Generative-AI-in-the-Enterprise?utm_source=tldrai]


Gretel provides a synthetic data platform that makes it easy to
generate anonymized, safe-to-share, and privacy-first synthetic data
for enterprises that are blocked by data sharing limitations or lack
of data. Developers that use Vertex AI for ML ops will now be able to
use synthetic data to meet privacy and data augmentation requirements,
resulting in accelerated ML R&D and operations. 

HOW SIRI, ALEXA, AND GOOGLE ASSISTANT LOST THE AI RACE (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/nWMq2?utm_source=tldrai] 

Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant had more
than a decade head start to become indispensable. But they were
hampered by clunky design and miscalculations, leaving room for
chatbots like ChatGPT to rise. 

HERE‚ÄôS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SLOW OR STOP AI (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.jonstokes.com/p/heres-what-it-would-take-to-slow?utm_source=tldrai]


In this thought experiment, the author breaks down each phase of
creating AI ‚Äî training, fine-tuning, and inference ‚Äî and what it
would take to slow down the development of AI at each of those phases.
Ideas to slow down AI proposed by the author include human
intervention, GPU costs, policy changes, legal restrictions, and even
invasions.
