HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 EMBEDDING ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA IN 15 MINUTES (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Embeddings serve as the foundation for many AI use cases. They can be
expensive and slow due to rate limits. This blog walks through using
Modal to scale up the embedding process efficiently and correctly. 

 GOOGLE SHOWS OFF LUMIERE, A SPACE-TIME DIFFUSION MODEL FOR REALISTIC
AI VIDEOS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google, the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Tel Aviv University
have unveiled Lumiere, a space-time diffusion model for realistic
video generation that promises more coherent motion and better quality
compared to existing AI video models. It's not yet available for
public testing.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPDIVE: GETTING STARTED WITH MECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY (30
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Neel Nanda is one of the pioneers of Mechanistic Interpretability
(MI). This is his guide to getting into the field. It features 200
concrete open questions. MI is the study of the quantitative values of
language models (e.g., actually looking at neurons). It is accessible
as it doesn‚Äôt require significant computation, and is extremely
promising as a research direction, although there has been minimal
success to date. 

 FUYU-HEAVY MULTIMODAL MODEL OUTPERFORMS GEMINI PRO (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Adept scaled up its Fuyu architecture and trained a larger version
that is currently the 3rd best model on MMMU. The model also performs
well on other tasks (e.g., achieving 40+ on HumanEval coding
benchmark). There were fewer challenges with scaling this architecture
than alternatives, in part due to its simplicity. However, there were
still challenges with data i/o, memory bandwidth, and custom kernel
development. 

 BOOSTING 3D OBJECT DETECTION FOR SAFER AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (17 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 HEDNet is a new encoder-decoder network designed to enhance 3D object
detection in autonomous vehicles, specifically addressing the
challenge of sparse point distribution in 3D scenes.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 A NEW DATASET FOR MUSIC-AND-LANGUAGE MODEL EVALUATION (GITHUB REPO)
[17] 

 The Song Describer dataset features over a thousand human-written
descriptions of music recordings. This new dataset aids in evaluating
music-and-language models through tasks like music captioning and
text-to-music generation. 

 IMPROVED DIALOG TRACKING WITH A NEW METHOD (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 This project presents a novel prompt pool method for dialog state
tracking that adapts to new user requirements without needing task
identities during testing. 

 AUDIO SYNTHESIS (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 DiffMoog is a new audio technology that combines the versatility of a
modular synthesizer with the power of neural networks. It allows for
automated sound matching and custom sound creation, making it a
valuable tool for audio synthesis. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 TENSORDICT (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 A great little utility that allows you to use dictionaries with
tensors in PyTorch. It improves readability and usability of code
while maintaining performance. 

 IF AI WERE CONSCIOUS, HOW WOULD WE KNOW? (7 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 The Turing Test and Searle's Chinese Room Thought Experiment are
often cited in the discussion of AI consciousness, with the former
testing if an AI's behavior is indistinguishable from a human's and
the latter arguing that external behavior alone cannot prove
consciousness. This debate highlights the difficulty in defining and
recognizing consciousness in AI, as our understanding is primarily
based on human experiences and functionalist approaches. 

 EVALUATION METRICS FOR LLM APPLICATIONS IN PRODUCTION (7 MINUTE READ)
[22] 

 This article discusses evaluation metrics that don't rely on ground
truth data. It explores general-purpose as well as RAG, chatbot, and
summarization-specific evaluations. All metrics come with a Python
implementation.

 APPLE MAKING ‚ÄòSIGNIFICANT‚Äô PUSH TO BRING AI TO IPHONES (2 MINUTE
READ) [23] 

 Apple is intensifying its focus on AI for the iPhone, acquiring
numerous AI companies, and increasing AI job postings. 

 BREEZEML (PRODUCT) [24] 

 BreezeML is an AI governance platform that enables compliance teams
to specify and continually monitor governance policies over every AI
workflow in its organization without relying on manual and tedious
coordination with data science teams. 

 EFFICIENT LLM TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [25] 

 Researchers have explored asynchronous Local-SGD (a variant of
federated averaging) for training language models.
