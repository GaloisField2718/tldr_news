 WHAT DOES ENTERPRISE READINESS LOOK LIKE FOR AN AI STARTUP? (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 A product is ‚Äòenterprise-ready‚Äô when it can meet the security,
compliance, and reliability [4] needs of larger customers ‚Äî starting
with compliance and security features like SSO and SCIM.

Supporting these enterprise features is an uphill battle for early
stage companies. This is a problem especially for AI companies [4]
where speed to market can mean life or death. Prioritizing
non-proprietary features over core product development can have severe
consequences.

This blog post by WorkOS [4] explains key priorities every AI company
should embrace to achieve Enterprise Readiness, and features insights
from industry leaders.

 WHAT TO DO WHEN THE APIS YOU DEPEND ON ARE SLOW, RATE-LIMITED, OR
INCOMPLETE? (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If you‚Äôre building an AI app (or any other software), you know how
painful API dependencies can be. Break free from the flaky APIs and
unstable sandboxes that are holding you back with powerful API mocking
[11]. Improve alignment, simulate complex scenarios, and run complete
integration tests to prevent downstream errors. Get a demo of WireMock
Cloud [10] 

 AICI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The Artificial Intelligence Controller Interface (AICI) lets you
build controllers that constrain and direct outputs of large language
models in real time. 

 VIRTUAL AVATARS (1 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SplattingAvatar introduces a new approach to creating lifelike
virtual humans by blending 3D mesh geometry with Gaussian Splatting
for vivid appearances. 

 PERSONALIZED AND EDITABLE FACE GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [14]

 WE HACKED GOOGLE A.I. FOR $50,000 (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google's LLM bugSWAT event challenged hackers to find security flaws
in their AI systems. Participants Joseph "REZ0" Thacker, Justin
"RHYNORATER" Gardner, and Roni "LUPIN" Carta discovered
vulnerabilities in Google's AI features, including exploiting a
GraphQL endpoint and leaking information from Google Workspace via
Bard's new extensions. Their collective efforts earned them $50,000
with Thacker, Carta, and Gardner securing the top three competition
places respectively. 

 AI SOLVES HUGE PROBLEM HOLDING BACK FUSION POWER (3 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Princeton researchers have trained an AI to predict and prevent
instabilities in nuclear fusion reactions, showing promise for
achieving stable fusion energy. By processing experimental data, their
AI learned to adjust magnetic fields in real-time to maintain stable
plasma within a tokamak reactor. This breakthrough demonstrates AI's
potential to overcome challenges in sustaining nuclear fusion and
could extend to other stability issues in the future. 

 ‚ÄúAI WILL CURE CANCER‚Äù MISUNDERSTANDS BOTH AI AND MEDICINE (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI advancements in healthcare raise concerns about overlooking
patient perspectives and deepening inequalities. Automated
decision-making systems often deny resources to the needy,
demonstrating biases that could propagate into AI-driven medicine.
This article advocates for participatory machine learning and
patient-led research to prioritize patient expertise in the medical
field.
