 AI AGENTS REVERSE-ENGINEERED AN ENTIRE APP USING ONLY UI INTERACTIONS
AND DATABASE LOGS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 What happens when business-critical applications run — but the
source code is missing? Thoughtworks tested whether AI could be used
to r [5]everse engineer a black box application [6].

→ Using the Playwright MCP Server, AI agents navigated Odoo ERP,
documenting user flows and capturing database changes after each
interaction — without backend access.

→ The AI mapped complex journeys, generated functional specs and
even built working prototypes.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE'S GEMINI AI WILL GET MORE PERSONALIZED BY REMEMBERING DETAILS
AUTOMATICALLY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new update for Gemini allows the AI chatbot to remember past
conversations without prompting. The feature will be turned on by
default, but can be disabled in settings. If turned on, Gemini
automatically recalls key details and preferences and uses them to
personalize its output. It has started rolling out to Gemini 2.5 Pro
in select countries and will eventually come to more locations and
Gemini 2.5 Flash. 

 HUAWEI AI CHIP-POWERED DEEPSEEK R2 TIPPED TO LAUNCH THIS MONTH (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepSeek-R2 is expected to be released before the end of the month.
The model will use a more advanced Mixture-of-Experts. It could
potentially have double the parameters of DeepSeek-R1. The model's
release will likely lead to competition with OpenAI's GPT-5. 

 XAI CO-FOUNDER IGOR BABUSCHKIN LEAVES COMPANY (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Igor Babuschkin, a technical co-founder of Elon Musk's xAI, has
announced his exit from the company. He played a key role in building

development since its inception in 2023.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI TRAFFIC IS UP 527%. SEO IS BEING REWRITTEN (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI-driven web traffic surged 527% from January to May, with LLMs like
ChatGPT and Perplexity reshaping user engagement. Legal, Finance, and
Health industries lead in AI-sourced sessions, indicating a shift
towards AI for complex inquiries. SEO must adapt to prioritize clarity
and relevance for AI selection, or risk falling behind in user
discovery. 

 GPT-OSS-120B PERFORMANCE VARIES DRAMATICALLY BY PROVIDER (10 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Artificial Analysis benchmarked OpenAI's gpt-oss-120B across 11 API
providers and found striking performance differences despite hosting
the same model. AIME math scores ranged from 78.3% on Azure to 93.3%
on Cerebras — a 15-point gap that suggests provider infrastructure
significantly impacts model capabilities. The major cloud providers
(Azure, Amazon Bedrock, and Nebius Base) consistently lag behind
smaller, specialized AI inference startups like Cerebras, Groq, and
Fireworks.

 GOOGLE DEVELOPS MAGIC VIEW FOR NOTEBOOKLM AS POSSIBLE NEW WAY TO
VISUALIZE NOTEBOOK DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A new feature codenamed Magic View has been spotted in Google's
NotebookLM. So far, the feature launches an animation that resembles a
dynamic canvas, though there's no clear indication of what its main
function will be. The feature was discovered via feature flag analysis
and code review. Given the pace and approach of Google's recent
updates to NotebookLM, it may be a while before Magic View is widely
available.
