RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GEMINI PAPER (35 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This 850+ author paper outlines much of the Gemini language modeling
effort from Google. It's understandably short on key architectural and
dataset details, but gives attribution and evaluation details. 

 ALIBABA‚ÄôS FONTDIFFUSER: ONE-SHOT FONT GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 FontDiffuser is a diffusion-based method for automatic font
generation, particularly excelling with complex characters and large
style variations. It features a Multi-scale Content Aggregation block
for better stroke preservation and a Style Contrastive Refinement
module for style transfer. 

 3D STRUCTURE RECONSTRUCTION FROM 2D LANDMARKS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The new 3D-LFM model uses transformers to reconstruct 3D structures
from 2D landmarks without needing 'in-correspondence' 3D data. This
approach, the first of its kind, efficiently handles varying point
numbers, occlusions, and can generalize to unseen categories.
