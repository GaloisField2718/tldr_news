 SOLVING THE ENTERPRISE DATA BOTTLENECK WITH SYNTHETIC DATA (SPONSOR)
[5] 

 AI/ML, research, and development teams are blocked by a solitary
point of failure‚Äîlack of fast access to high-quality data [5]. When
data is unavailable, of low quality, or contains sensitive
information, developers can‚Äôt use it to build. The result: data
doesn‚Äôt reach the teams who need it most ‚Äî and innovation suffers.
Gretel [5] provides the end-to-end tools for generating, evaluating,
and operationalizing synthetic data for diverse enterprise use cases.
Download the solution brief [5] to learn how Gretel and synthetic data
can solve the data bottleneck for your dev team [5].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL'S NEW MODEL AND NEW FUNDING (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The 8-month-old AI group is set to raise $400m+ in a new round. It
also released an 8x7B Mixture of Experts model which is currently
being evaluated by the community. 

 GOOGLE UNVEILS ALPHACODE 2, POWERED BY GEMINI (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's DeepMind has released AlphaCode 2, an improved
code-generating AI model that outperforms 85% of human competitors in
programming contests, showcasing advanced capabilities in solving
complex mathematical and theoretical computer science problems. 

 STABILITY AI LAUNCHES STABLELM ZEPHYR 3B (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 StableLM Zephyr 3B, a new 3 billion parameter chat model, is being
released as an extension of the StableLM 3B-4e1t model, drawing
inspiration from the Zephyr 7B model. It is designed for efficient
text generation, particularly in instruction following and Q&A
contexts, and has been fine-tuned on multiple datasets using the
Direct Preference Optimization algorithm.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BETTER, CHEAPER, FASTER ALIGNMENT WITH KTO (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most alignment frameworks require ranked preference data (A is
preferred to B). This is usually expensive and rare. This new
framework only requires an independent yes or no rating per data
point. 

 STRIPEDHYENA 7B MODEL (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Transformer models have dominated the AI landscape recently. They are
powerful sequence learners but have some drawbacks. This new work,
which builds on state space models, shows that new architectures can
bring great benefits like increased context length. 

 VIDEO EDITING WITH PRE-TRAINED TEXT-TO-IMAGE DIFFUSION MODELS (3
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 RAVE is a video editing method that uses existing text-to-image
diffusion models to enhance videos. This approach allows for
high-quality video edits while maintaining the original movement and
structure.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 UNDERSTANDING 100X SPEED UP IN LLM INFERENCE (38 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 With open models becoming useful for many enterprise tasks, people
are starting to explore deployment optimizations. However, the
landscape is complex and scattered. This post is a nice deep dive into
many of the standard techniques used to speed up language model
serving. 

 PEARL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A Production-ready Reinforcement Learning AI Agent Library brought by
the Applied Reinforcement Learning team at Meta. 

 MULTI-CONDITIONAL DIFFUSION MODEL FOR SCENE SYNTHESIS (GITHUB REPO)
[14] 

 Scene creation, guided by factors like human movement or room design,
gets a fresh angle by integrating textual prompts. This repo
introduces a novel approach, a multi-conditional diffusion model, that
efficiently merges text, movement, and existing objects.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXCUSE ME, BUT THE INDUSTRIES AI IS DISRUPTING ARE NOT LUCRATIVE (12
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google's Gemini AI model, despite an impressive demo video, saw only
a minimal stock increase for Google, reflecting skepticism about its
real-time capabilities as the demo used pre-recorded footage and
edited responses. This skepticism mirrors broader concerns in the AI
industry, where companies create high expectations but face challenges
in translating AI capabilities into substantial economic gains, with
current AI models excelling in areas that don't necessarily yield high
financial returns. 

 RUNNING LLMS LOCALLY WITH OLLAMA (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ollama is like a package manager around llama cpp models. It has
quality-of-life usability features and makes it easy to run models,
even on a CPU. This example shows how to run two great models, Dolphin
and Samantha, which are excellent unfiltered models useful for
conversational tasks. 

 LLM VISUALIZATION (WEBSITE) [17] 

 This site looks at how the nano-gpt model, which has 85,000
parameters, sorts a sequence of six letters into alphabetical order.

 HOW TO BUILD AN AI CAPABLE OF THOUGHT (SPONSOR) [18] 

 This article presents a framework to simulate human-like thought
processes in a computer, as a path to AGI. Contains numerous unique
illustrations by Jared Reser Ph.D. Read the paper (free, ungated) [18]


 FTC LOOKING INTO MICROSOFT‚ÄôS INVESTMENT IN OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is inspecting Microsoft's
relationship with and investment in OpenAI.

 The testing framework for ML models from tabular to LLMs. 

 LIQUID AI, A NEW MIT SPINOFF, WANTS TO BUILD AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF
AI (4 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Liquid neural networks are much smaller than traditional AI models
and require far less compute power to run.
