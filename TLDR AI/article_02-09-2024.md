 COHERE COMMAND R UPDATE (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Command R and Command R+ received an upgrade on essentially all
tasks. They are now better at recall, speed, math, and reasoning. 

 WORKERS AT GOOGLE DEEPMIND PUSH COMPANY TO DROP MILITARY CONTRACTS (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nearly 200 Google DeepMind employees signed a letter urging Google to
terminate military contracts, claiming a violation of the company's
own AI ethics principles. DeepMind technology has been bundled into
Google Cloud and sold to militaries, sparking internal conflict with
AI staff who value ethical standards. Google's response demonstrated
an adherence to AI Principles, but workers remain unsatisfied, seeking
stronger governance against military use of their AI. 

 APPLE'S ROBOTICS WORK AIMS TO SOLVE USER'S FIRST-WORLD PROBLEMS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple may be expanding into robotics, potentially introducing devices
that move, such as an iPad mounted on a robotic arm. Headed by VP of
Technology Kevin Lynch, Apple's robotics efforts are progressing with
the help of experts from firms like Israel's Technion, and propose to
include AI interfaces beyond Siri. While still conceptual, Apple is
considering a 2026 or 2027 release for these new robotic products.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 AUXILIARY-LOSS-FREE LOAD BALANCING FOR MOES (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Routing tokens to experts in MoEs helps sparsify the computation.
However, learning that routing can be challenging. There is typically
a complicated loss structure. This paper shows a novel way to overcome
this problem and dramatically improve expert balancing and training
stability. 

 IMPROVING LOW-LIGHT VIDEO QUALITY (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This end-to-end framework simultaneously addresses low-light
enhancement and motion deblurring in videos using event cameras. 

 SOUND SOURCE LOCALIZATION (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have proposed a new audio-visual learning framework for
enhancing sound source localization, addressing the issue of false
negatives in traditional methods. The framework includes two schemes:
Self-Supervised Predictive Learning (SSPL) and Semantic-Aware
Contrastive Learning (SACL). SSPL eliminates false negatives by
focusing on positive-only learning, while SACL refines the contrastive
learning process to improve alignment between audio and visual
features.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TRL RELEASE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This may be one of the bigger improvements to the Transformer
Reinforcement Learning library. It includes onlineDPO, Liger Kernels,
WinRate Callbacks, and more. 

 FAST SD SUPPORT FOR SCHNELL ON CPU (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A popular inference library now has support for Flux Schnell running
on the CPU. 

 SPIKING DIFFUSION MODELS FOR IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Spiking Diffusion Models (SDMs) is a new family of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) designed for image generation, offering significant
energy savings and high biological plausibility.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LAION 5B SAFETY RELEASE (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Laion 5B was the largest open image dataset on the internet. It was
shut down over concerns of inappropriate and harmful images. The
organization has made significant efforts to mitigate these issues and
is now rereleasing the dataset. 

 THE NEXT GENERATION PIXAR: HOW AI WILL MERGE FILM & GAMES (13 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Generative AI is poised to revolutionize storytelling, blending
narrative depth with the dynamic interactivity of video games. Recent
advancements in generative models such as OpenAI's Sora and Luma AI's
Dream Machine are accelerating this shift, enabling real-time,
interactive video creation. This evolution has the potential to
produce the next "Pixar" in interactive media, merging film, gaming,
and AI. 

 CHINA'S ROBOT MAKERS CHASE TESLA TO DELIVER HUMANOID WORKERS (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Over 25 Chinese companies showcased humanoid robots aimed at factory
automation at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, backed by
substantial government investments and leveraging China's deep supply
chain. The global humanoid robot market is predicted to hit $38
billion by 2035. China aspires to mass-produce these robots by 2025,
intensifying competition with Tesla's upcoming Optimus robot. Tesla
anticipates that it will deploy 1,000 Optimus robots in its factories
in the next year, while Chinese firms forecast significant cost
reductions for their models.
