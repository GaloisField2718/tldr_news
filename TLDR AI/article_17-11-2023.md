HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPMIND AND YOUTUBE PARTNER ON MUSIC SYNTHESIS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepMind has been working on music synthesis for a number of years
and now just announced a powerful new system. Interestingly, much of
the boost came from a data partnership with revenue sharing. Meaning
it trained on artists‚Äô music for a better performing model while
ensuring that the artists were compensated. The model will be
available in a number of forms, one of which is via YouTube Shorts
Studio. 

 META ANNOUNCES VIDEO EDITING AND CREATION MODELS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Oftentimes when you generate an output image with a generative model,
it isn‚Äôt quite what you were looking for. However, editing that
image with the same model is extremely challenging. Meta had a key
insight that treating all generations as instructions allows editing
capabilities to emerge. This, coupled with the new simplicity of the
model architecture, is quite a nice step forward. 

 MICROSOFT LAUNCHES A DEEPFAKE CREATOR (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft launched Azure AI Speech text-to-speech avatar at the
Microsoft Ignite 2023 event, allowing users to create photorealistic
avatars that can speak scripted text in various languages using
text-to-speech technology.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SENTENCE ALIGNMENT FOR LARGE DOCUMENTS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SentAlign is a new tool for aligning sentences in large parallel
documents, capable of handling thousands to tens of thousands of
sentences efficiently. 

 IMPROVING VIDEO QUESTION ANSWERING WITH A NEW METHOD (16 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Researchers found that Large Language Models sometimes make errors in
Video Question Answering (VideoQA) by depending too much on the
language and ignoring the actual video content. To solve this,
researchers introduced a new approach called Flipped-VQA, which makes
these models better understand the relationship between videos,
questions, and answers, leading to more accurate results. 

 A DATASET TO UNDERSTAND STUDENT BEHAVIOR (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers have expanded the SCB-ST-Dataset4, which captures
activities like hand-raising, reading, and writing to better
understand and detect students' classroom behaviors using deep
learning.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SOLVE USAGE-BASED BILLING FOR YOUR AI PRODUCT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Most companies are still figuring out how to charge for AI and LLM
tools. Packages? Credits? Tokens? Whichever model you choose, Orb [12]
makes it as easy as can be to implement ‚Äî just choose your pricing
model and billable [12] metric and you‚Äôre done! Track consumption,
prevent fraud, and align pricing to value (including GPU runtime). Try
the free sandbox [12] 

 DEEP DIVE: DEVELOPER‚ÄôS GUIDE TO PRODUCTION LLMS (21 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Building tools with language models is an emerging engineering
discipline that spans high performance computing, GPU orchestration,
and monitoring. 

 ACCELERATING SEGMENT ANYTHING WITH PURE PYTORCH (11 MINUTE READ) [14]


 We can speed up Segment Anything 8x by using Torch compile, Sparsity,
customer kernels with Triton, and a number of other PyTorch
performance features. 

 AI EXPLOITS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A collection of real-world AI/ML exploits for responsibly disclosed
vulnerabilities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MUSIC CONTROLNET (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ControlNet was a novel way to give fine-grained control to image
synthetics models. Now there is a somewhat analogous model for music
generation that lets you control a number of features like speech and
pitch. 

 THERE‚ÄôS A MODEL FOR DEMOCRATIZING AI (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI's call for proposals on implementing democratic processes in
AI decision-making appears restrictive and seems to prefer handling
sensitive political issues without taking responsibility, potentially
limiting the scope and effectiveness of democracy in AI governance. 

 COPILOT IS AN INCUMBENT BUSINESS MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The Copilot AI business model enhances existing workflows for
efficiency without creating new markets or disrupting lower ends, but
its true disruptive potential lies in reimagining workflows, a
challenge that could unlock significantly larger market opportunities.

 GOOGLE IS EMBEDDING INAUDIBLE WATERMARKS RIGHT INTO ITS AI GENERATED
MUSIC (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Google DeepMind's AI Lyria model will use SynthID to watermark audio
tracks generated using its technology, making them identifiable as
AI-created without affecting the listening experience, even after
compression or other modifications.

 Let AI automate your meeting notes using GPT-4 Turbo. 

 YOUTUBE WILL SHOW LABELS ON VIDEOS THAT USE AI (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 YouTube is implementing new guidelines requiring creators to disclose
the use of AI in their videos, including both AI-altered and entirely
synthetic content.
