HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LLAMA 3 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has released an 8B and 70B model with dramatically improved
performance, particularly in reasoning, context length, and code. It
is still training a 400B parameter model, which will match Opus in
performance. These models are easily the most powerful available open
models. 

 GOOGLE'S DEEPMIND AI CAN HELP ENGINEERS PREDICT "CATASTROPHIC
FAILURE" (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mathematicians and Google's DeepMind researchers have utilized AI to
find large collections of objects that lack specific patterns,
assisting in understanding potential catastrophic failures like
internet severing due to server outages. Their approach employs large
language models to iteratively generate and refine set-free
collections, facilitating the study of worst-case scenarios. This
research reflects the combined power of AI and human ingenuity in
tackling complex problems. 

 OPENAI WINDS DOWN DALL-E 2 (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The launch of OpenAI's DALL-E 2 in April 2022 marked a groundbreaking
and tumultuous period in AI history, as a tight-knit group of artists
and tech enthusiasts explored the intersection between language and
visual arts using the technology. However, the amazement and
exhilaration soon gave way to concerns about the ethics of training AI
models on copyrighted creative work without permission or
compensation, leading to a polarizing debate that continues to
reverberate in the AI space as OpenAI moves on to DALL-E 3 and other
AI image synthesis models emerge.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FEDERATED LEARNING FOR MODEL ADAPTATION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have developed a new method called Federated Proxy
Fine-Tuning (FedPFT) that improves the adaptation of foundation models
for specific tasks while preserving data privacy. 

 OPTIMIZING IN-CONTEXT LEARNING IN LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a new approach to enhancing In-Context Learning
(ICL) in large language models like Llama-2 and GPT-J. Its authors
present a new optimization method that refines what they call 'state
vectors' ‚Äî compressed representations of the model's knowledge. 

 SPORTS ANALYTICS WITH GAME STATE RECONSTRUCTION (16 MINUTE READ) [10]


 SoccerNet-GSR is a new dataset aimed at advancing game state
reconstruction from single-camera football video footage.

 FACILITATING GENAI DEVELOPMENT WITH OPEN-SOURCE LLMS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Whether you're building customer-facing or internal apps, the¬†high
cost of paid genAI tools [11]¬†can be a roadblock. Open-source LLMs
can be dramatically cheaper; they're also better for compliance and
local training on proprietary data. This¬†blog post by AgileEngine
[11]¬†reviews the leading open-source LLMs, highlighting their
strengths and adoption strategies. Read the blog [11] 

 MODEL INTERPRETATION WITH COMPONENT MODELING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Component modeling breaks down a model's prediction process into its
basic elements, like convolution filters and attention heads, to
understand their specific contributions to the final output. 

 AI GATEWAY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 AI Gateway is an interface between apps and hosted large language
models. It streamlines API requests to LLM providers using a unified
API. AI Gateway is fast, with a tiny footprint, and it can load
balance across multiple models, providers, and keys. It has fallbacks
to ensure app resiliency and supports plug-in middleware as needed. 

 TINY VISION MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Moondream is a tiny vision language model trained on top of Phi-2. It
has enormously powerful performance for its size, although it still
struggles with some hallucination. Moondream is small enough to run on
a phone and on edge devices. It enables a myriad of commercial vision
capabilities.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SPACE OF POSSIBLE MINDS (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The emergence of sophisticated AIs is challenging fundamental notions
of what it means to be human and pushing us to explore how we embody
true understanding and agency across a spectrum of intelligent beings.
To navigate this new landscape, we must develop principled frameworks
for scaling our moral concern to the essential qualities of being,
recognize the similarities and differences among various forms of
intelligence, and cultivate mutually beneficial relationships between
radically different entities. 

 INTRODUCTION TO SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS (33 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This guide explores using open-source embedding models to enhance AI
projects. It covers criteria for model selection and methods for
effective deployment. The guide utilizes Sentence Transformers, an
open-source library, for practical examples. 

 CUDA IS STILL A GIANT MOAT FOR NVIDIA (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 NVIDIA's dominance in the AI space continues to be secured not just
by hardware, but by its CUDA software ecosystem and proprietary
interconnects. Alternatives like AMD's ROCM struggle to match CUDA's
ease of use and performance optimization, ensuring NVIDIA's GPUs
remain the preferred choice for AI workloads. Investments in the CUDA
ecosystem and community education solidify NVIDIA's stronghold in AI
compute.
