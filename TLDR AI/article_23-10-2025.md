 ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES TO BUILD THE NEXT WAVE OF AGENTIC AI AT BUILD
2025 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You can't have an AI strategy without a data strategy. The most
powerful agents are grounded in your data, connected across pipelines,
and deployed securely at scale.

Join BUILD [4] (Nov 4-7), a free virtual developer conference where
you'll learn how build reliable, production-ready agentic applications
on Snowflake. Expect:

 	* DEEP DIVES on the latest Snowflake AI capabilities and cool OSS
use cases with LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangGraph, Postgres, Streamlit,
TruLens, and more.
 	* HANDS-ON LABS using Snowflake managed MCP and optimizing Llama for
performance, cost, and architecture.
 	* INSPIRATION FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS like Andrew Ng, Mark Russinovich
(Microsoft Azure), Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), and Anahita Tafvizi
(Snowflake).

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META LAYS OFF 600 FROM ‘BLOATED' AI UNIT AS WANG CEMENTS LEADERSHIP
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta will lay off roughly 600 employees to reduce layers and operate
more nimbly. The cuts will impact workers across Meta's AI
infrastructure units, the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research
unit, and other product-related positions. They will not impact
employees within TBD Labs. Meta will pay 16 weeks of severance plus
two weeks for every completed year of service, minus the notice
period. 

 WHY COHERE'S EX-AI RESEARCH LEAD IS BETTING AGAINST THE SCALING RACE
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI labs are racing to build giant data centers due to a deep belief
that adding more compute power to existing AI training methods will
eventually yield superintelligent systems. A growing group of AI
researchers are saying that the scaling of large language models may
be reaching its limits and that other breakthroughs may be needed to
improve AI performance. Cohere's former VP of AI Research has launched
a new startup, Adaption Labs, to build thinking machines that adapt
and continuously learn. If the startup is right about the limitations
of scaling, the implications could be huge - billions of dollars have
already been invested in scaling. 

 SNAPCHAT MAKES ITS FIRST OPEN PROMPT AI LENS AVAILABLE FOR FREE IN
THE US (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Snapchat's new "Imagine Lens" AI, initially exclusive to paid users,
is now free in the US, allowing users to edit or generate Snaps by
inputting custom prompts. This expansion comes amid competition from
Meta and OpenAI's advanced AI video features. Snap aims to attract
users by offering limited free AI-generated images with plans to
expand access to other countries.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THOUGHTS ON THE AI BUILDOUT (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's Sam Altman wants to create a factory that can produce a
gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week. To make this vision
happen would require a lot of work. This article looks at whether the
vision is physically feasible and what it could mean for different
energy sources, upstream CapEx, and the US vs China competition. 

 HOW WELL DOES RL SCALE? (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 RL-training for LLMs scales poorly. Most gains are from allowing LLMs
to productively use longer chains of thought. This may be evidence
that compute scaling will be less effective for AI progress than
previously thought. The finding could lengthen timelines and affect
strategies for AI governance and safety. 

 SMUGGLED INTELLIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GPT-5 Pro has solved complex problems in abstract algebra and aided
in quantum computing research, showcasing AI's growing capability to
perform expert-level tasks. Creating these benchmarks involves
extensive human input, highlighting the ongoing need for human
oversight in AI applications.

 OUTSYSTEMS AGENT WORKBENCH: BUILD AI AGENTS THAT CAN HANDLE
MISSION-CRITICAL WORK (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Create custom AI agents that you can actually ship in one unified
AI-powered low-code platform [11]. Build multi-agent workflows with a
visual drag-and-drop interface, connect to your enterprise data, and
deploy with built-in security and governance. No fragmented tools or
previous AI expertise required. See how it works [11] 

 HELION (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Helion is a Python-embedded domain-specific language (DSL) for
authoring machine learning kernels that compiles down to Triton. It
makes it easier to write correct and efficient kernels while enabling
more automation in the autotuning process. Helion combines a familiar
and high-level PyTorch-like syntax with a powerful ahead-of-time
autotuning engine to provide a unique balance of developer
productivity, fine-grained control, and performance portability. It is
currently in beta. 

 WORLD MODELS FOR EMBODIED AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 World-In-World introduces the first open benchmark platform for
evaluating world models in closed-loop environments where agents
actively interact with their surroundings. It shifts focus from visual
fidelity to task performance. 

 LIGHTWEIGHT MEMORY FOR LLM AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 LightMem is a streamlined memory management system for large language
models that offers tools for storing, retrieving, and updating
long-term memory in AI agents with minimal overhead.

 REDDIT SUES PERPLEXITY FOR ALLEGEDLY RIPPING ITS CONTENT TO FEED AI
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Reddit is suing Perplexity, SerpApi, Oxylabs, and AWMProxy to stop
them from scraping its data. It claims Perplexity will apparently do
anything to get Reddit's data except enter into an agreement with
Reddit directly. Reddit sent a cease-and-desist letter to Perplexity
in May last year, demanding it stop scraping Reddit data, but
Perplexity claimed it didn't use Reddit content. This was shown to be
untrue after content posted on Reddit was produced by Perplexity
within hours of the post being made. 

 THIS CHART IS SO INSANE IT LOOKS FAKE (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ChatGPT's one-month retention has skyrocketed from under 60% two
years ago to an unprecedented ~90%. YouTube was the previous
best-in-class with ~85%. ChatGPT's six-month retention is trending to
~80%.
