 üÜï¬†WORKSHOP SERIES: BUILD AI APPLICATIONS ON CLOUDFLARE USING
WORKERSAI AND VECTORIZE (SPONSOR) [6] 

 Build an end-to-end generative AI app in this hands-on workshop by
Cloudflare [5]! Learn how to code and deploy live AI-powered customer
support apps, as well as a RAG application.

Over 4 sessions, Kristian Freeman will introduce the new AI additions
[7] to Cloudflare‚Äôs developer platform ‚Äî including Workers AI [8]
(GPU-powered compute) and Vectorize ‚Äî and walk you through building
and optimizing AI applications with Cloudflare.
The series starts with AI foundations (embeddings, models, vector
DBs), and moves on to practical sessions where you‚Äôll deploy working
AI applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MONARCH MIXER 32K RETRIEVAL MODEL (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Together Compute has been exploring many different Transformer
alternatives. It has released a retrieval model that outperforms many
closed embedding models for retrieval tasks. 

 LANGUAGE MODELS ARE SENSITIVE TO PROMPTS (23 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 It turns out that prompting models for few shot benchmarks can give
anywhere from 4-88% accuracy on the task, depending on the prompt.
This research shows how to scientifically improve your prompts. 

 DEEP DIVE INTO BLIND MOTION DEBLURRING (35 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This paper presents a thorough overview of deep learning's role in
blind motion deblurring, a key area in computer vision. It covers
everything from basic concepts and limitations of traditional methods
to a detailed comparison of modern techniques like CNNs, GANs, RNNs,
and Transformers.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 A NEW METHOD FOR SINGING VOICE SYNTHESIS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers have developed a new framework to better understand and
analyze singing voices. By using self-supervised learning on isolated
vocal tracks and focusing on out-of-domain generalization, they made
progress in tasks like singing voice similarity and synthesis,
improving upon existing technologies. 

 IMPROVING CODE TRANSLATION WITH SIMPLE LANGUAGE HELP (GITHUB REPO)
[16] 

 This study demonstrates that adding simple language explanations to
code significantly improves how language models translate between 19
different programming languages, especially for complex codes. 

 MINIMA, A NEW EFFICIENT LANGUAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This project tackles the challenge of distilling large language
models into smaller student models. The researchers discovered a
consistent optimal capacity gap for different student models and used
the insight to create MiniMA, a 3B model distilled from a 7B teacher
model. MiniMa sets new benchmarks in efficiency and performance.

 33B PARAMETER CYBERSECURITY LANGUAGE MODEL RELEASED (6 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 This model has been trained in both offensive and defensive security.
It is a general purpose coding model that can assist in cyber security
tasks. This means you can use it to secure your networks and learn how
to protect from different hacks and vulnerabilities. 

 SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF KERNEL MATRICES (30 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This post explores how eigenvalues change for different Kernel
Matrices and what that means for learning properties. 

 NVIDIA‚ÄôS CEO ON LEADING THROUGH THE A.I. REVOLUTION (25 MINUTE
PODCAST) [20] 

 NVIDIA CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang discusses on this podcast how
he leads his company in the face of accelerating change, sharing
insights on how founders can integrate AI into their business in order

 IT‚ÄôS HUMANS ALL THE WAY DOWN (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 People think that AI is going to replace a lot of jobs because
everyone thinks that everyone else's job is easy. The desire to remove
humans from the equation is based on ignorance. Even with the wildest
of innovations, people still matter, and this can't be avoided. People
want to appeal to other humans and be seen and understood.
