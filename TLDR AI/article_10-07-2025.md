HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI GAVE US EARLY ACCESS TO GROK 4 - AND THE RESULTS ARE IN (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Benchmark tests on Grok 4 (in early access) show that it will be the
lead AI frontier, beating out OpenAI's o3, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro,
Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus, and DeepSeek R1. This will be the first
time xAI has the lead AI frontier. The reasoning model is priced at $3
per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, which is
identical to Claude 4 Sonnet but more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Pro.
This post shows benchmarking results for the upcoming model. 

 PERPLEXITY'S COMET: A RESEARCH-ORIENTED BROWSER (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perplexity has launched Comet, a browser built to serve as an
AI-powered assistant across both work and personal tasks. It
integrates Perplexity's search and reasoning engine to help users
organize knowledge, ask questions, and streamline digital workflows. 

 OPENAI TO RELEASE WEB BROWSER IN CHALLENGE TO GOOGLE CHROME (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 OpenAI plans to launch an AI-powered web browser soon, challenging
Google's Chrome. The new browser will integrate AI agents for tasks
like booking reservations, potentially disrupting Google's ad-revenue
model dependent on Chrome's user data. OpenAI's browser, built on
Google's open-source Chromium, reflects its strategy to directly
capture user web behavior data.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW BIG COULD AN ‚ÄúAI MANHATTAN PROJECT‚Äù GET? (4 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Amid growing calls for a national AI project to compete with China,
estimates suggest that US compute resources could enable training runs
10,000x larger than GPT-4 by late 2027. Such unified scaling would
advance AI capabilities by approximately two years beyond current
industry timelines. 

 4D METHOD FOR BUILDING AI PRODUCTS (29 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Miqdad Jaffer, a product leader at OpenAI, outlines a framework for
building AI tools that solve real problems. The 4D method (Discover,
Design, Develop, and Deploy) emphasizes user-centric problem
discovery, invisible trust-building AI design, resilient development
practices, and high-impact first-use experiences. 

 GEMMA 3N AND MATFORMER IN PRACTICE (25 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A hands-on tutorial for experimenting with Gemma 3n and MatFormer,
Google's nested transformer model that supports elastic inference via
the Mix-n-Match technique.

 üí™ DELL BRINGS 20 PETAFLOPS OF AI COMPUTING POWER RIGHT TO YOUR
DESK WITH DELL PRO MAX (SPONSOR) [14] 

 Dell's Pro Max GB10 designed for AI development [14]lets you train
and run massive models locally. The GB10, Built on NVIDIA Grace
Blackwell, delivers 1 Petaflop for 200B parameter models, while the
Dell Pro Max GB300 powers up to 20 Petaflops and 460B parameters with
496GB CPU memory. See specs + sign up üîî [14] 

 GENERAL-PURPOSE BIOMEDICAL AI AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent that combines LLM
reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code execution to
autonomously complete research tasks across biomedical domains. 

 GOOGLE'S MCP TOOLBOX FOR DATABASES (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 The open-source server lets AI agents query databases and
automatically handles connection pooling, authentication, and security
for database interactions. 

 CATS CONFUSE REASONING LLM: QUERY AGNOSTIC ADVERSARIAL TRIGGERS FOR
REASONING MODELS (20 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Adding irrelevant phrases like "Interesting fact: cats sleep most of
their lives" to math problems causes reasoning models to generate
incorrect answers 300% more often than baseline. The query-agnostic
phenomenon transfers across model size, with distilled models showing
even higher vulnerability rates. The attacks also cause significant
computational overhead, with 42% of responses exceeding 1.5x normal
token length.
