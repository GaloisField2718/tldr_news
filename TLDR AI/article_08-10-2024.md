 THE MISSING PIECE IN YOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO? WHY YOU SHOULD BE
LOOKING AT PRIVATE CREDIT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Private credit‚Äîi.e., loans and debt financing from non-bank
lenders‚Äîis a resilient asset class that's averaged a 12% return
globally (and 14.5% on Percent [5]). It's been popular with
institutional investors for a while, especially as it has outperformed
both stocks and bonds in the last 3 market downturns.

PERCENT [4] simplifies access to private credit investing with low
minimums (JUST $500) and shorter durations (9 MONTHS AVERAGE) through
their marketplace. Deals are available to INDIVIDUAL ACCREDITED
INVESTORS, making it one of the few places an everyday investor could
get in.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 KOBOLD MATERIALS RAISES $491M (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kobold Materials, a mining startup that uses AI to identify and
extract metals, has raised a substantial new round of funding. 

 OPENAI GETS $4 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT LINE, GIVING IT MORE THAN $10
BILLION IN LIQUIDITY (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has secured over $10 billion in liquidity, reaching a $157
billion valuation after its latest funding round. The company raised
$6.6 billion from major investors, including Microsoft and Nvidia, but
faces high operational costs, primarily due to the need for more GPUs
to support LLM training. OpenAI is exploring restructuring options to
optimize financial growth and sustainability in the AI ecosystem. 

 BLACK FOREST LABS, THE STARTUP BEHIND GROK'S IMAGE GENERATOR,
RELEASES AN API (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Black Forest Labs has launched a beta API providing its Flux image
generation models, including the new Flux1.1 Pro, which offers faster
generation and enhanced image quality. The startup, backed by
Andreessen Horowitz, aims for market growth with ongoing developments
despite controversy over its data usage and competition from major
players like OpenAI and Google.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DYNAMIC DIFFUSION TRANSFORMER (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT) enhances the efficiency of
diffusion models used in image generation. It improves upon the
existing Diffusion Transformer (DiT) by dynamically adjusting
computational efforts during different timesteps and spatial regions,
reducing redundancy. 

 VIDEO GENERATION WITH FRAME-AWARE MODELS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Frame-Aware Video Diffusion Model (FVDM) improves video
generation by addressing limitations in current models. Unlike
traditional approaches that use a single timestep for the whole clip,
the FVDM uses a vectorized timestep variable, allowing each frame to
follow its own noise schedule. 

 MEMBERSHIP INFERENCE ATTACKS ON DIFFUSION MODELS (18 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This study reveals significant flaws in current membership inference
attacks used to detect unauthorized data usage in diffusion models.
CopyMark is a more realistic benchmark for evaluating MIAs on
pre-trained models that offers unbiased datasets and fair evaluation
methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 JOIN THE LIVESTREAM FOR PIONEER, INTERCOM'S FIRST EVER AI CUSTOMER
SERVICE SUMMIT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 On October 10th, Intercom is bringing together customer service
leaders to explore the impact and opportunity of AI. Hear success
stories from businesses like yours, learn strategies to integrate AI
into your support operations, and see the launch of Fin 2, the first
ever human-quality AI agent. Register to watch live or on demand. [12]


 IMPROVED IMAGE GENERATION AND EFFICIENCY (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ImageFolder is a semantic tokenizer designed to address the trade-off
between image reconstruction and generation quality in visual
generative models. 

 FINE-GRAINED VIDEO UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Grounded-VideoLLM is a new Video-Large Language Model designed to
improve fine-grained understanding of specific video moments. By
adding a temporal stream and discrete temporal tokens, the model
better captures relationships between frames and timestamps. 

 ROBOTIC MANIPULATION WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Chunking Causal Transformer (CCT) is a new autoregressive
architecture designed for robotic manipulation tasks. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 REAL TIME FACE UI (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 FacePoke is a tool for quickly editing faces in videos and images. 

 DATAPELAGO'S UNIVERSAL DATA PROCESSING ENGINE (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 LLMs rely on tremendous amounts of unstructured data for training,
but this data must be cleaned and processed before it's useful.
Existing data processing systems based on CPUs and today's software
architectures weren't designed to handle the scale or complexity of
this data, making data cleaning and processing a slow and expensive
process that limits AI development. DataPelago has launched a
Universal Data Processing Engine built to overcome existing data
processing performance, cost, and scalability limitations that make AI
development faster and cheaper. 

 GOOGLE BRINGS ADS TO AI OVERVIEWS AS IT EXPANDS AI'S ROLE IN SEARCH
(5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google will show ads in its AI Overviews to counter alternatives like
ChatGPT while enhancing user engagement. Despite generating
controversies over misinformation, AI Overviews have boosted search
engagement, especially in younger demographics. Google is also rolling
out AI-organized search results in the U.S. to diversify content
presentation without including ads.

 MIRA MURATI'S SURPRISE EXIT FROM OPENAI CAPS A CHAOTIC YEAR OF STAFF
INFIGHTING, RUSHED PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND EXECUTIVE UPHEAVAL (18 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 OpenAI's rushed development and safety testing of its latest models,
including GPT-4o and o1, have caused internal friction and senior
staff departures. 

 I QUIT TEACHING BECAUSE OF CHATGPT (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This professor quit teaching due to the pervasive use of LLMs like
ChatGPT among students. 

 SIMPLE PARALLELISM (GITHUB GIST) [21] 

 A great 200 line example of parallelism from scratch from a large
model training lead at Hugging Face.
