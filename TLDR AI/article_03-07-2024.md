HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMAZON BEEFS UP AI DEVELOPMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon is enhancing its AI capabilities by hiring top talent from AI
startup Adept and licensing its technology. 

 YOUTUBE NOW LETS YOU REQUEST REMOVAL OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT OF YOUR
FACE OR VOICE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 YouTube has updated its policies to allow individuals to request the
takedown of AI-generated or synthetic content that mimics their voice

 GOOGLE AI OVERVIEWS: NEW RESEARCH STUDY BY SE RANKING (22 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Google's AI Overviews (AIO) feature now appears in only 8.71% of
SERPs for 100K keywords, a significant decrease from 64% pre-rollout,
with most AIOs linking to top 10 organic results. The length of AIO
content and number of links have both increased post-rollout,
indicating Google's emphasis on detailed answers and authoritative
sources. SEO strategies must adapt to remain relevant in this evolving
search landscape, where user queries with more words, lower search
volumes, and lower CPC are more likely to trigger AI-generated
responses.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 META 3D GEN (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has trained a state-of-the-art 3D object generation model along
with a PBR texture generation system. It uses the company's internal
2D image generation model as a tool for synthetic data generation. 

 ADAPTABLE LOGICAL CONTROL FOR LLMS (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This work allows for interactive text editing and controlling model
generation at inference time. It allows for logical constraints in
generation and achieves strong performance with small models. 

 CLASSIFICATION WITH PAIRWISE DIFFERENCE LEARNING (22 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Researchers have extended Pairwise Difference Learning (PDL),
initially a regression technique, to the task of classification.
Instead of predicting outcomes directly, PDL predicts differences
between pairs of instances.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MUTAHUNTER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 An open-source language agnostic LLM-based mutation testing for
automated software testing. 

 ROBOTICS WITH LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LLaRA is a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve robot action policy through conversation-style
instruction-response pairs. By integrating visual inputs, these Vision
Language Models (VLMs) process state information and generate optimal
policy decisions. 

 BOOSTING MULTIMODAL MODELS WITH DIVERSE VISUAL INSTRUCTION DATA
(GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MM-Instruct is a large-scale dataset aimed at enhancing the
instruction-following abilities of large multimodal models (LMMs).

 WHY WE NO LONGER USE LANGCHAIN FOR BUILDING OUR AI AGENTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Octomind abandoned the LangChain framework for AI test automation in
favor of simpler, modular building blocks, which improved its codebase
and team productivity. It encountered inflexibility with LangChain's
high-level abstractions, complicating development and maintenance. By
switching strategies, Octomind now enjoys a leaner architecture and
faster iteration for its AI agent tasks. 

 THE FIVE STAGES OF AI GRIEF (22 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Benjamin Bratton, the director of the Antikythera program at the
Berggruen Institute and a professor at the University of California,
San Diego, discusses the global reaction to artificial intelligence as
a ‚ÄúCopernican Trauma," equating it with past shifts that have
redefined humanity's self-perception. Bratton proposes five stages of
"AI grief" ‚Äî denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance ‚Äî
to frame societal responses to AI's evolution, from skepticism to
integration into our understanding of intelligence. He argues that the
integration of AI reflects a broader biological and technological
evolutionary process, rather than a distinctively human narrative.
