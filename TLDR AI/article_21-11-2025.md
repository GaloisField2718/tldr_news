 HOW GENAI AND LLMS ARE DRIVING REVENUE GROWTH IN ECOMMERCE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Ecommerce teams are experimenting with AI, but most are still
figuring out how to move from proof-of-concept to production.

Algolia's ebook [4] breaks down how generative AI and LLMs are being
deployed in ecommerce today - and driving 3-15% revenue uplift with:

 	* AI-generated product descriptions and marketing content at scale
 	* Personalized recommendations using LLMs trained on customer
behavior
 	* Virtual try-ons and product customization

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI 3 PRO IMAGE (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nano Banana Pro, aka Gemini 3 Pro Image, claims studio-quality image
gen and editing. It can render text (a historic struggle), consistent
multi-character scenes, and real-world knowledge integration for
creating infographics. 

 A NEW WAY TO COLLABORATE IN CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Group chats are now rolling out globally to ChatGPT Free, Go, Plus,
and Pro plans. Users can now invite up to 20 other people into a
shared conversation with ChatGPT. Group chats are optional and
separate from private conversations. Personal ChatGPT memory isn't
shared in group chats, and no new memories are created from them.
Users can only join group chats via invitation, and they can choose to
leave or remove members from the chat at any time.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SOME THOUGHTS ON AI (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gemini 3 shows that scaling laws for pretraining are intact. This
means that Blackwell models are likely to show a significant increase
in performance when they come out next year. GPT-5 was not evidence of
a slowdown in scaling laws - the model was designed to be cheaper to
inference, not better. While Gemini 3 was trained on TPUs, coherent
FLOPs is what matters for pre-training, so the results should transfer
to Blackwell chips fine. 

 OPENAI CAN'T BEAT GOOGLE IN CONSUMER AI (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI can't beat Google at consumer AI as long as it is still in the
chatbot paradigm. Recent OpenAI launches haven't done well. OpenAI
needs new form factors to drive incremental growth. Google's data
advantage is really showing, and its little advantages from its wide
variety of apps add up. Microsoft and Amazon are at risk of losing the
largest AI workloads. 

 THE SCALING WALL WAS A MIRAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Gemini 3 showed that models can still improve by adding more compute
during scaling. It has the same parameter count as Gemini 2.5 but with
massive performance improvements. Google credits the improvements to
pre-training and post-training and says that there is still no limit
in sight. The model release is the strongest evidence since OpenAI's
o1 that pre-training scaling still works when algorithmic improvements
meet better compute.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 WE'RE THE AI COMPANY THAT DOESN'T HAVE CHURN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 We actually have a 127% NET REVENUE RETENTION (our voice agents are
pretty good). They sound human, run 24/7, and never ask for PTO. IF
YOU WANT TO SEE FOR YOURSELF, we're offering to build you a custom
agent for your business for free. GET IT HERE [11]. 

 PARALLEL EXTRACT (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Parallel Extract is an API that fetches content from URLs and returns
it as Markdown. It is built on the same proprietary web index and
retrieval infrastructure that powers Parallel's Search, Task, FindAll,
and Monitor APIs. Parallel Extract can reliably extract information
from the most challenging sites. Developers can try Extract for free
in the Parallel Developer Platform. 

 INTRODUCING CLINE-BENCH: A REAL-WORLD, OPEN SOURCE BENCHMARK FOR
AGENTIC CODING (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 cline-bench is a new initiative focused on creating high fidelity
benchmarks and reinforcement learning environments derived from real
open source development scenarios. AI models have advanced
significantly, but the field still lacks a rigorous open source
benchmark that represents real engineering work. Model labs require
evals that expose real breakdowns. cline-bench supports the next stage
of AI research and development by creating research-grade environments
that capture actual engineering constraints. 

 AUTOCOMP (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Autocomp is a framework for optimizing tensor accelerator code. It
helps hardware designers extract the full performance of tensor
accelerators. Autocomp outperforms human expert kernel writers by up
to 17x on AWS Trainium. It is highly portable and easy to use.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ACT-1 (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ACT-1 is a frontier robot foundation model trained on zero robot
data. It was trained with special Skill Capture Gloves, which allow
for data collection from anywhere without having to move robots
around. The glove-based data collection produces higher quality data
than teleoperations on contact-rich tasks. Videos of Sunday Robotics'
Memo robot performing tasks using the ACT-1 model are available in the
thread. 

 OPENAI'S DOMINANCE IS UNLIKE ANYTHING SILICON VALLEY HAS EVER SEEN (7
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI dominates the AI landscape with secretive financials and a
rapid expansion strategy across data centers, applications, and
devices. CEO Sam Altman's aggressive partnerships with Nvidia,
Broadcom, Oracle, and AMD underscore a $500 billion growth trajectory.
Despite concerns about competition, industry leaders see OpenAI's
rapid pace as both a challenge and an asset, sparking a "gold rush
mentality" in AI investments.
