HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PUSHING THE FRONTIERS OF AUDIO GENERATION (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 DeepMind has talked a little bit more about the audio generation
models used to power NotebookLM. 

 OPENAI'S NEW HALLUCINATION BENCHMARK (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released the SimpleQA benchmark, which measures models'
abilities around simple factual questions. 

 EVALUATING FEATURE STEERING: A CASE STUDY IN MITIGATING SOCIAL BIASES
(17 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This study explores using feature steering in AI models to
interpretably modify outputs. It reveals a "steering sweet spot",
where changes do not degrade capabilities. The study results show
steering can alter social bias in targeted domains but also brings
unexpected off-target effects. Further research is required to refine
feature steering for safer, more reliable outcomes in AI models. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THUNDERKITTENS 2 (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Thunder Kittens is a framework for writing extremely performant GPU
Kernels. It is built on the idea that GPUs actually want to operate on
small 16x16 tiles of data. In turn, the useability is quite high, and
40% faster kernels only take a few hundred lines of code. 

 REALISTIC MOTION RETARGETING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MeshRet has introduced a novel approach for improving motion
retargeting for 3D characters that focuses on preserving body geometry
interactions from the start. 

 BETTER GENERATION WITH SELF-GUIDANCE SAMPLING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have enhanced Masked Generative Models (MGMs) with a new
self-guidance sampling method, improving their image generation
quality while maintaining diversity. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SPEEDING UP TRANSFORMERS WITH TOKEN MERGING (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This project introduces PiToMe, an algorithm that compresses Vision
Transformers by progressively merging tokens after each layer. This
method reduces the number of tokens processed. 

 3D RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT POSE DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 PF3plat tackles the challenge of pose-free 3D reconstruction and
novel view synthesis from RGB images, eliminating the need for extra
data. 

 A BENCHMARK FOR EVALUATING DATA CURATION METHODS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SELECT is the first large-scale benchmark for comparing data curation
strategies in image classification. ImageNet++ is a new dataset that
extends ImageNet-1K with five new training-data shifts, each assembled
using different curation techniques. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 FINE-TUNING LLMS TO 1.58BIT: EXTREME QUANTIZATION MADE EASY (24
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 BitNet, developed by Microsoft Research, introduces a transformer
architecture that reduces LLM computational and memory requirements by
using ternary precision (-1, 0, 1) equating to 1.58 bits per
parameter. Models are required to be trained from scratch. BitNet can
also fine-tune existing models to this low-precision format,
maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks. This approach
significantly reduces energy consumption and improves inference speed
using specialized kernels for efficient matrix multiplication. 

 HOW WE SAVED HUNDREDS OF ENGINEERING HOURS BY WRITING TESTS WITH LLMS
(7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Assembled uses LLMs to accelerate and improve software testing,
enabling test generation in minutes instead of hours. This approach
increases engineering productivity, saving time and shifting focus to
feature development. LLMs generate comprehensive and accurate tests
that maintain code quality and development velocity. 

 25% OF SMARTPHONE OWNERS DON'T WANT AI AS APPLE INTELLIGENCE DEBUTS
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A CNET survey revealed that only 18% of smartphone users are
motivated by AI features to upgrade their devices, with privacy and
cost being significant concerns. Major manufacturers like Apple,
Google, and Samsung are integrating more AI capabilities in their
phones, yet many users prioritize battery life and storage over AI
functions. AI subscriptions are set to become common, but nearly half
of users are unwilling to pay for these features.

 RIME AI ACHIEVES 100% API UPTIME IN 2024 WITH BASETEN (SPONSOR) [16] 

 Rime AI, who trains custom speech synthesis models with over 200
distinct voices, achieved <300 milliseconds p99 API latency with
perfect uptime after switching to Baseten for model inference. Read
Rime's story. [16] 

 GOOGLE PREPS ‘JARVIS' AI AGENT THAT WORKS IN CHROME (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Google's Project Jarvis, powered by Gemini 2.0, aims to automate
web-based tasks in Chrome by using AI agents capable of reasoning and
planning. 

 OPENAI'S WHISPER TRANSCRIPTION TOOL HAS HALLUCINATION ISSUES,
RESEARCHERS SAY (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Concerns have risen over OpenAI's Whisper introducing hallucinations
in transcriptions, even in medical contexts. 

 FORERUNNER K2 HUMANOID ROBOT CAN CARRY 33 LB IN EACH DEXTEROUS HAND
(3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Kepler has unveiled the Forerunner K2 humanoid robot, which has
advanced AI, improved hardware, and enhanced vision and navigation
systems for better real-time interaction.
