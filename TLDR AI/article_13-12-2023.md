HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PHI 2 AVAILABLE IN AZURE MODEL STUDIO (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Phi 2 is the next generation in the series of tiny language models
from Azure trained primarily on synthetic data. The 2.7B parameter
model matches the performance of 13B parameter models. The challenge
here is detecting and mitigating ‚Äútest set rephrasing‚Äù, but in
either case, the model is quite powerful. 

 OPENAI LEADERS WARNED OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR BEFORE SAM ALTMAN‚ÄôS
OUSTER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A group of senior leaders at OpenAI raising concerns to the board
about Sam Altman's allegedly psychologically abusive behavior, which
included creating chaos and pitting employees against each other,
along with accusations of Altman's dishonesty in board communications,
led to his brief firing. Altman's reinstatement followed overwhelming
employee support and threats of mass resignations, but the incident
has left uncertainties within the company and questions about its
future direction. 

 MISTRAL PLATFORM (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mistral now has an API with new models, an embedding, and
instruction-tuned models. It has an unreleased medium-sized model that
outperforms GPT-3.5.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VISION-LANGUAGE MODELING WITH REDUCED GPU USAGE (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have introduced Compound Text-Guided Prompt Tuning
(TGP-T), a new method for Vision-Language Models like CLIP. TGP-T
reduces GPU memory usage significantly while improving performance. It
achieves this by optimizing prompts with text supervision, allowing
more flexibility and efficiency in handling a variety of categories. 

 ENHANCING NERF TRAINING WITH IMAGE CORRESPONDENCE PRIORS (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 CorresNeRF introduces a novel approach to improve Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) performance, especially in scenarios with limited input
views. By utilizing image correspondence priors for supervision, this
method refines NeRF training, resulting in enhanced photometric and
geometric accuracy. 

 ANOMALY DETECTION USING DIFFUSION MODELS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 DiAD leverages the power of diffusion models to detect anomalies. It
uniquely combines a pixel-space autoencoder, a Semantic-Guided (SG)
network, and a feature-space extractor to accurately detect and
localize anomalies in multi-class settings.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MAKING 3D EDITING EASIER WITH 2D IMAGE PROCESSING (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 AGAP is a new method that simplifies 3D editing. By using a 2D image,
called a canonical image, AGAP allows users to easily edit 3D scenes
without re-optimizing for each change. 

 ENHANCING TEXT-PROMPTED 3D CONTENT CREATION (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Sherpa3D is a groundbreaking framework that improves 3D content
creation from text prompts. It combines the strengths of 2D and 3D
diffusion models, using coarse 3D knowledge to guide the creation
process. This results in high-quality, diverse, and geometrically
consistent 3D assets, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. 

 ACCELERATING NEURAL VOLUMETRIC VIDEO RESEARCH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 EasyVolcap is a PyTorch library for accelerating neural volumetric
video research, particularly in areas of volumetric video capturing,
reconstruction, and rendering. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 INTEROPERABLE AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Coordinating communication between language models and users is key
given how fast model capabilities are advancing. The Interoperable
Authorization Protocol (IAP) aims to address this by establishing
secure, adaptable communication channels and a consent management
system. This open-source approach encourages collaboration in the AI
community to align AI operations with diverse human values and goals. 

 MIT GROUP RELEASES WHITE PAPER ON GOVERNANCE OF AI (9 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A committee of MIT leaders and scholars has released policy briefs
providing a framework for U.S. AI governance, advocating the extension
of existing regulatory and liability approaches to oversee AI
effectively. Their proposal aims to enhance U.S. leadership in AI,
minimize potential harms, and encourage beneficial AI applications,
emphasizing the need for a clear purpose and intent definition in AI
tools and suggesting possible new oversight structures. 

 ON PLATFORM SHIFTS AND AI (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In the 2022 TCV Engage Summit, the conversation highlighted that
while AI represents a technological shift, it lacks a new distribution
channel, which is crucial for creating significant consumer
opportunities. Current AI innovations must rely on traditional
distribution methods, favoring established companies or innovative
startups, but the potential for new distribution platforms remains
uncertain.
