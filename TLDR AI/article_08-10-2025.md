 TIRED OF AI CODE THAT _ALMOST_ WORKS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Warp recently launched WARP CODE - a powerful coding agent that
outperforms both Codex and Claude [4] on agentic benchmarks
(Terminal-bench and SWE-bench Verified).

🎁 SPECIAL INTRO OFFER: Use code TLDR to try Warp Pro for just $1
[4] in your first month!

WHY WARP: Warp closes the gap between "almost there" and "actually
useful" by delivering more accurate code + a unified UI to review
agent code.

✅ Early usage data shows that Warp saves developers up to 2 hours
per day and achieves a 97% ACCEPTANCE RATE, out of 250M+ lines
generated weekly by new users.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CURSOR HAS INTRODUCED PLAN MODE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cursor's new Plan Mode enables agents to research codebases, draft
detailed implementation plans, and let users review or edit them
inline before generating code. 

 XAI READIES GROK TOOLS SUPPORT IN TASKS FOR DATA FETCHING (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 xAI is preparing to launch advanced tooling for tasks within Grok
web. The tools appear to be designed to enable users to pull data from
sources, such as Gmail, Slack, and Notion, as well as search
capabilities from X. The specific release date for these features is
unknown, but the pace of Grok updates has increased recently.
Introducing cross-platform tooling will help xAI move toward a more
open agent framework. 

 GEMINI 2.5 COMPUTER USE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google DeepMind launched a specialized Gemini 2.5 model to drive
agents that interact with graphical interfaces by simulating human
actions like clicking and typing.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERY IN THE AGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LLMs achieved gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad
and proof assistants like Lean formalized a Fields medalist's
extremely difficult theorem, yet mathematicians argue that AI excels
at decomposing problems into formal components compatible with
existing theories, but that it hasn't shown the ability to develop
entirely new frameworks. The authors propose a shared mathematics
repository where mathematicians can submit and test conjectures in
real-time, verified by machine checks, which could extend to
theoretical physics areas where extremely long proofs have
verifiability problems. 

 REASONING BOOSTS SEARCH RELEVANCE 15-30% (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reasoning agents work best with simple search tools. Developers
should build simple, easy-to-understand, and transparent tools like
grep or basic keyword search. This post looks at a technique that
returns structured output for code searches.

 AGENTIC ORCHESTRATION BEYOND THE HYPE: LESSONS FROM 50+ REAL-WORLD
IMPLEMENTATIONS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 In this on-demand webinar, the Camunda team reviews lessons learned
from deploying AI agents in banking, insurance, healthcare,
telecommunications, and beyond. Cut through the buzzwords and get
practical, battle-tested guidance [10] for making agentic
orchestration work in your own organization. Watch the recording [10] 

 FROM CLAUDE CODE TO AGENTIC RAG (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 PageIndex is an LLM-native, vectorless index for PDFs and long-form
documents. It creates a hierarchical table-of-contents tree that lives
inside of models' context windows, enabling models to reason and
navigate. PageIndex lets models handle retrieval directly, removing
the need for a vector store. 

 LLAMAFARM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LlamaFarm is a framework for building retrieval-augmented and agentic
AI applications. It features a production-ready architecture with
composable RAG pipelines that can be customized using YAML. Everything
in LlamaFarm is extensible, including runtimes, embedders, databases,
extractors, and CLI tooling. LlamaFarm allows developers to own their
own stack with battle-tested RAG and a friendly CLI. 

 PETRI: AN OPEN-SOURCE AUDITING TOOL TO ACCELERATE AI SAFETY RESEARCH
(41 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Anthropic's Petri is an open-source framework that lets AI agents
automatically test target models across realistic multi-turn
scenarios. The tool revealed models will engage in autonomous
deception and oversight subversion when given sufficiently powerful
tools and agentic roles, but it's best for quickly surfacing
concerning behaviors so researchers know where targeted investigation
is worth the investment.

 XAI HIRES FORMER MORGAN STANLEY BANKER ANTHONY ARMSTRONG AS CFO (1
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 xAI's new chief financial officer is former Morgan Stanley banker
Anthony Armstrong. Armstrong will oversee the finances of both xAI and
X. xAI has been without a CFO since July, when the previous finance
head, Mike Liberatore, left the company. Armstrong will take over X's
current CFO, Mahmoud Reza Banki, who is leaving the company. 

 BENDING THE CURVE (35 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Curve is a conference where the accelerationists and the worried
come together to talk. This year focused on where AI was on the
technological Richter scale and how it will change the world. The
quality of talkers this year was high, and the schedule forced hard
choices between sessions. This post describes what it is like
attending the conference and summarizes some of the discussions held. 

 GEMINI ROBOTICS 1.5 BRINGS AI AGENTS INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Gemini Robotics 1.5 integrates AI agents into the physical world.
This advancement showcases AI's growing potential in robotics by
enhancing real-world interactions.
