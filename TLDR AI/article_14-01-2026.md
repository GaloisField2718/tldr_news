HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING ANTHROPIC LABS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic Labs has expanded its team to incubate experimental
products at the forefront of AI capabilities, leveraging rapid model
advancements. Co-founder of Instagram, Mike Krieger, has joined Labs
for collaborative product development. Ami Vora will lead product
organization alongside CTO Rahul Patil to scale Claude experiences.
Recent successes include Claude Code's billion-dollar growth and the
Model Context Protocol's rise to industry standard. 

 GOOGLE UPGRADES VEO 3.1 WITH INGREDIENTS AND 4K UPSCALING (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Veo 3.1 update introduces new features designed for both casual
creators and professionals. Users can now generate videos based on
reference images. The tool now supports native vertical outputs
tailored for mobile devices, and high-resolution upscales to 1080p and
4K are also available. The release is available now across multiple
Google services and platforms. 

 GOOGLE TESTS GEMINI AUTO BROWSE TOOL FOR CHROME USERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google is testing an Auto Browse tool for Gemini that lets the AI
manage tasks in Chrome. The tool will allow Gemini to autonomously
browse the web, manage tabs, and directly interact with Chrome on
users' behalf. Code references indicate that Auto Browse may be
exclusive to the Gemini Ultra plan. Google is rolling out the feature
incrementally to a limited audience in the US.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE ALL-STAR CHINESE AI CONVERSATION OF 2026 (72 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tsinghua University and Zhipu co-hosted AGI-Next, a summit for
frontier AI, in Beijing on January 10. The event included a series of
keynotes by notable figures in the Chinese AI industry. This post
contains a translated transcript of the event, revealing a fascinating
conversation about the AI landscape in China that covers the technical
side, corporate dynamics, as well as the future envisioned by China's
industry Titans. The event took an honest look at whether China's
open-source leadership has actually narrowed the technology gap with
the US, China's emerging AI-for-business paradigm, and what it will
take for Chinese researchers to take riskier bets. 

 VIBE CODING WITHOUT SYSTEM DESIGN IS A TRAP (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI-assisted coding streamlines product creation but often sacrifices
long-term design sustainability. It prioritizes immediate
functionality, leading to hardcoded configurations, which are fragile
for future updates. Successful product development requires
experienced system design to avoid a "build-now, regret-later"
scenario, transforming AI vibes into structured, sustainable
solutions. 

 INTRODUCING THE AI CHIP SALES DATA EXPLORER (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The AI Chip Sales data explorer uses financial reports, company
disclosures, and more to estimate compute, power usage, and spending
over time for a wide variety of AI chips. The cumulative global AI
compute capacity has reached the equivalent of more than 15 million
Nvidia H100 GPUs. The cost to purchase these chips has rapidly
escalated to tens of billions of dollars per quarter, drawing over 10
GW of power per quarter. A link to the interactive data explorer is
available.

 AI CODE REVIEW WITH COMMENTS YOU'LL ACTUALLY (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Unblocked [11] is the AI code review that surfaces real issues and
meaningful feedback instead of flooding your PRs with stylistic
nitpicks and low-value comments.

“_Unblocked made me reconsider my AI fatigue. Finally, a tool that
surfaces context only someone with a full view of the codebase could
provide_.” - Senior developer, Clio

 ENGRAM: HOW DEEPSEEK ADDED A SECOND BRAIN TO THEIR LLM (16 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 DeepSeek's Engram architecture introduces a conditional memory system
that uses lookup tables for common N-gram patterns, significantly
reducing computational overhead in LLMs. This approach boosts
performance on knowledge benchmarks and reasoning tasks by efficiently
freeing up neural resources for complex reasoning. Engram's design
leverages tokenizer compression, multi-head hashing, and context-aware
gating, providing a marked improvement over MoE baselines without
substantial memory impact. 

 GLM-IMAGE: AUTO-REGRESSIVE FOR DENSE-KNOWLEDGE AND HIGH-FIDELITY
IMAGE GENERATION (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GLM-Image is an open-source, industrial-grade discrete
auto-regressive image generation model with a hybrid architecture that
combines an auto-regressive module with a diffusion decoder. It excels
in text-rendering and knowledge-intensive generation scenarios. The
model performs especially well in tasks that require precise semantic
and complex information expression. It supports a rich set of
image-to-image tasks. 

 DEEP SEARCH AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CaRR improves reinforcement learning for deep search agents by
replacing binary rewards with citation-based rubric feedback.

MISCELLANEOUS

 "HELLO, COMPUTER." (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Vocal computing may finally become mainstream due to new AI
advancements in LLMs overcoming past limitations of systems like Siri
and Alexa. OpenAI's breakthroughs and its acquisition of a hardware
startup hint at innovative voice-driven devices potentially moving
beyond the smartphone. As tech companies refine and develop diverse
hardware for AI, voice control is pivotal in advancing towards a more
integrated and intuitive tech ecosystem. 

 THE DANGER OF BORROWED AI CERTAINTY (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI introduces "borrowed certainty" in software, creating technical
debt by replacing proof and evidence with confident-seeming
predictions. Developers often mistake AI's fluency for validity,
risking decisions based on unearned certainty. Best practices include
treating AI output as a hypothesis, demanding traceability, ensuring
human understanding, and pairing AI with execution feedback.
