 HUGGING FACE ACQUIRES XETHUB (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hugging Face serves and stores a lot of data, most of it in LFS.
XetHub has written its own, powerful, alternative for scaling Git
repositories. 

 HUMANE'S DAILY RETURNS ARE OUTPACING SALES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Humane's AI Pin faced a significant return rate post-launch with
negative reviews, leading to approximately 7,000 of the sold units
remaining with customers. Despite raising over $200 million from tech
luminaries, Humane struggled with over $1 million in returns and
internal leadership turnover. Amidst financial woes, there's
speculation about a potential HP acquisition and new debt fundraising
efforts. 

 GPT-4O SYSTEM CARD (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aligning a voice system is challenging. This post highlights the
ongoing efforts to ensure the multimodal model is safe and helpful.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 QWEN2-MATH (27 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Qwen team has released a 72B math model that outperforms all open
and closed models on MATH. It also outperforms Llama-3.1-405B on a
number of reasoning benchmarks. It is limited to English only, with
multilingual models coming soon. 

 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION IN PATHOLOGY (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SAM2-PATH is a new framework designed to enhance semantic
segmentation in digital pathology. 

 A MULTILINGUAL DATASET FOR SPOKEN LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING (11 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Speech-MASSIVE is a new multilingual Spoken Language Understanding
(SLU) dataset. It offers a speech-based counterpart to the MASSIVE
textual corpus.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 üèãÔ∏èOPTIMIZE LLAMA3.1-8B TO OUTPERFORM GPT-4O (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Learn to harness small open source models to overpower the big closed
source providers, all while controlling your own data.

Watch this recorded webinar session [13] to see:

 	* Efficient LLM optimization techniques for open source models
 	* 1.23x more quality and 25x lower cost for Llama3.1-8B over GPT-4o
 	* A code-level LLM demo for redacting PII from enterprise data

Get the slides, code samples, and testing credits to try these
techniques on OctoAI [13].

 PYTORCH FLEXATTENTION (21 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PyTorch has released a new API that allows any type of attention
variant to be coded and compiled to Triton. This allows for better
portability, performance, and research velocity on types of attention.


 A LANGUAGE MODEL WITH QUICK PRE-TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The "1.5-Pints" Language Model presents a new approach to
compute-efficient pre-training. By curating a high-quality dataset of
57 billion tokens, this model surpasses Apple's OpenELM and
Microsoft's Phi in instruction-following tasks, as measured by
MT-Bench. 

 VIDEO MOMENT RETRIEVAL AND HIGHLIGHT DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Lighthouse is a user-friendly library designed to tackle the
challenges in video moment retrieval and highlight detection.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY AI HASN'T SHOWN UP IN THE GDP STATISTICS YET (7 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Despite impressive progress in LLMs solving complex tasks, they still
fall short on consistently performing human-like tasks at scale. LLMs
require detailed prompt engineering and iteration to achieve
acceptable accuracy, limiting their current potential as direct human
replacements in workflows. OpenAI's recent updates to JSON output
control and cost reduction may address some issues, but the nuanced
integration required for LLMs in organizational contexts suggests
incremental productivity gains rather than immediate economic
transformation. 

 AI IS COMING FOR INDIA'S FAMOUS TECH HUB (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 India's technology outsourcing industry is facing a pivot as AI
integration threatens jobs, especially in basic tasks like call
centers. Companies are challenged to ascend the value chain amidst a
hiring slowdown, with some hopeful AI tools will create new
opportunities in sectors like programming. The industry's future
demands higher-level cognitive skills as automation continues to
redefine traditional roles. 

 INSIDE THE COMPANY THAT GATHERS ‚ÄòHUMAN DATA' FOR EVERY MAJOR AI
COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Breakthroughs in AI pre-training have enabled models to process
massive online datasets, while subsequent supervised fine-tuning with
experts helps models generalize and gain specialized knowledge.
Turing's approach of using "input and output pairs" generated by
subject-matter experts aims to advance AI reasoning capabilities.
Anticipating an "agentic" era of AI, these models could autonomously
perform complex tasks by integrating specialized knowledge across
domains.
