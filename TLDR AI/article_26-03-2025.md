 THE PLAYBOOK BEHIND OPENAI'S PRICING STRATEGY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI companies face a unique problem when it comes to pricing: On one
hand, users expect a frictionless experience that allows
experimentation without barriers. On the other, every product
interaction comes at a very real price. Training models can cost
millions, and expenses for API calls quickly add up.

That tension can make profitability a delicate balancing act – but
it doesn't have to. As the billing engine powering OpenAI, Metronome
wrote the pricing and billing playbook [4] that AI startups need to
get their pricing right. The playbook dives deep into the pricing
strategies that enabled OpenAI's soaring revenue [4], including:

 	* Token-based pricing metrics to bridge resource consumption + user
engagement
 	* Redefining billing as a product experience
 	* The nuances of OpenAI's PayGo + prepaid credits model
