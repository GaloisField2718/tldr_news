 OPENAI CHANGES POLICY TO ALLOW MILITARY APPLICATIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI has revised its usage policy to potentially allow military
applications of its technologies, a change from its previous policy
that explicitly prohibited such use. 

 USING AI, MIT RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY A NEW CLASS OF ANTIBIOTIC
CANDIDATES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Utilizing deep learning, MIT researchers have discovered compounds
capable of killing the drug-resistant bacteria MRSA responsible for
over 10,000 deaths annually in the U.S.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 I AM A STRANGE DATASET: METALINGUISTIC TESTS FOR LANGUAGE MODELS (18
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is a challenge type of phrase that is self-referential, for
example, ‚Äúthe last word in this sentence is is‚Äù. Language models
struggle immensely with this sort of language. This paper introduces a
dataset and some evaluations to help improve language models'
metalinguistic capability. 

 PIXART-Œî: FAST AND CONTROLLABLE IMAGE GENERATION WITH LATENT
CONSISTENCY MODELS (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 PixArt has been a parallel research direction to the popular Stable
Diffusion set of image generation models. This work brings faster
generation with Latent Consistency Models and better control with
ControlNet style prompting. 

 SLEEPER AGENTS: TRAINING DECEPTIVE LLMS THAT PERSIST THROUGH SAFETY
TRAINING (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic released some really interesting research that purposefully
poisons a language model with a sleeper phrase that elicits some
behavior. It found that it was unable to ‚Äúalign‚Äù this sort of
model with the powerful system used for its production models.
Meaning, once the model had been poisoned, bad behavior could not be
removed with current tools.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ANIMATE ANYONE REPLICATION (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 AnimateAnyone is an amazing video control model that takes an image
and skeleton motion as input and then animates the person in the
control image. This code is an open replication of that work. 

 MULTILINGUAL OCR LINE DETECTOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Line detection is where you put a bounding box around a line of text
in an image or PDF. Surya is an extremely powerful multi-lingual line
detection model. 

 AUTOMATICALLY NARRATE YOUR LIFE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Using a combination of GPT4-V, top-of-the-line text-to-speech, and
some computer capture software, you can have folks like David
Attenborough narrate everything that is happening in your life.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CASE FOR CYBORGS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 An expert in human cognition and AI discusses the evolution from
artificial narrow intelligence to general intelligence, proposing
cyborg integration as a potential path to superintelligence. 

 PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF AI WITH VIJAY PANDE (40 MINUTE PODCAST)
[14] 

 A 40-minute reflection on AI with a peek at what‚Äôs to come. 

 PROMPT ALIGNED IMAGE PERSONALIZATION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Dreambooth is the current best method for personalizing an image
model. Prompt alignment dramatically improves adherence to the prompt
and is composable.

QUICK LINKS

 HELP LLMS UNDERSTAND HTML, PDF, CSV, PNG, AND PPTX (SPONSOR) [16] 

 Unstructured is software that extracts and transforms complex data
(webpages, docs, images‚Ä¶) for use with every major vector database
and LLM framework. Make your data LLM-ready [16] 

 SEAMLESS EXPRESSIVE TRANSLATION (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta has a new demo for seamless voice cloning and translation
between languages. 

 VANNA (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Use AI to interact with your database. 

 MICROSOFT WANTS TO AUTOMATICALLY LAUNCH ITS COPILOT AI ON SOME
WINDOWS 11 DEVICES (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft is currently testing an update in Windows 11's Dev Channel
preview that automatically launches the AI-powered Copilot feature on
widescreen devices with a screen size of at least 27 inches and a
pixel width of 1920 pixels. This experiment, aimed at enhancing AI
integration in Windows, is part of Microsoft's broader initiative to
incorporate AI technology more seamlessly into its operating system.
