HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

WORKERS AI: SERVERLESS GPU-POWERED INFERENCE ON CLOUDFLARE‚ÄôS GLOBAL
NETWORK (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]

Cloudflare unveils "Workers AI," a serverless AI inference platform on
its global GPU network. Workers AI features popular open-source models
and collaborates with Hugging Face.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

KOSMOS-2.5 (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11419?utm_source=tldrai]

The UniLM group at Microsoft has done some great work in the past few
years around natural language. With the suite of Kosmos models,
they‚Äôve recently moved into images. This specific instantiation is
for reading text-intensive documents from an image and generating the
text or markdown for that document. It is similar to the recent Meta
work for academic OCR. 

EFFICIENT VIDEO MODEL TRAINING (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16669v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Training top-notch video models usually need huge resources, often
beyond what academia can access. Researchers have found a way to train
these models using just one machine with eight standard GPUs in a day.


TEACHING IMAGE-RECOGNIZING MODEL THROUGH CONVERSATION (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05950v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have developed a new way to improve vision-language
models, which are models that understand both text and images, using
just natural language prompts.

STREAMINGLLM (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm?utm_source=tldrai]

Language models are limited by their context length. The context
length is usually limited by compute hardware and clever algorithmic
updates. This is an algorithmic update that streams the tokens through
the attention mechanism to allow theoretically infinite context window
size. Usually, these claims fall over at scale, but this one seems
robust as it can work on existing pre-trained models without
fine-tuning. Will it make the forgotten middle issue worse though? 

IMPROVING OPTICAL FLOW WITH GAUSSIAN ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/la30/gaflow?utm_source=tldrai]

Optical flow helps figure out how things move in images. This study
introduces new techniques using Gaussian Attention to focus on finer
details and match them better, resulting in a model named GAFlow.
