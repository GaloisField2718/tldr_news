 FROM ‚ÄúSHARK TANK‚Äù TO SMART HOME STARDOM (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Venture capitalists know how difficult it is to spot PROMISING EARLY
INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, and the story of Ring doorbells is the
perfect example. Even the all-knowing Sharks from _Shark Tank
_declined the offer to buy 10% of Ring for $700,000, and now the
company has blown up, all thanks to retail distribution.¬†
Next, let's turn our attention to RYSE: the brand set to follow a
similar trajectory. The founder PITCHED ON CANADA'S VERSION OF _SHARK
TANK, DRAGONS' DEN_, received two offers [3], and now their patented
tech is currently sold in over 100 Best Buy stores.¬†

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COHERE LAUNCHES NEW RERANK 3 MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cohere has released its newest foundation model, Rerank 3,
purpose-built to enhance enterprise search and Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems. The model is compatible with any database or
search index and can also be plugged into any legacy application with
native search capabilities. Rerank 3 can boost search performance or
reduce the cost of running RAG applications with negligible impact on
latency with a single line of code. 

 META BROADENS LABELING OF AI CONTENT (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta is expanding its "Made with AI" labeling to cover a broader
range of AI-generated content starting in May in response to the
evolving landscape of manipulated media. Labels will be applied
through various means, including user disclosure and detection of
AI-made content. The policy update follows recommendations from Meta's
independent Oversight Board. 

 MISTRAL'S NEW MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mistral has released a new 8x22B model via magnet link. The first
version of benchmarks from the community show it performs admirably as
a base model with 77 MMLU (commonly associated with reasoning).

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ENHANCED GEOMETRIC DETAIL IN STEREO MATCHING (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Motif Channel Attention Stereo Matching Network (MoCha-Stereo) is
a novel approach that preserves geometric structures often lost in
traditional stereo matching methods. 

 POINT CLOUD COMPRESSION (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 PoLoPCAC is a method for lossless point cloud attribute compression
that marries high efficiency with strong adaptability across varying
scales and densities of point clouds. 

 MULTI-CAMERA 3D OBJECT DETECTION (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study introduces a weak-to-strong eliciting framework to improve
surround refinement in Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection (MC3D-Det), a
field enhanced by bird's-eye view technologies.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 USING AMAZON BEDROCK AND CONFLUENT TO BUILD A GENAI CHATBOT WITH
ACCESS TO REAL-TIME DATA (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Learn how to build a virtual banking chatbot [11] that answers user
questions based on real-time data. This demo uses Amazon Bedrock to
power the chatbot with any GenAI model (in this case Claude by
Anthropic), and Confluent Cloud [12] to make real-time data available
for retrieval. Watch the demo [11] 

 TRANSFORMING IMAGES INTO 3D MESHES IN SECONDS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project unveils InstantMesh, a framework that generates 3D
meshes from a single image instantly, boasting unmatched quality and
scalability. 

 EXPLORING CONCEPT LEARNING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A recent study investigated how different concepts are understood by
various layers within large language models. It found that simpler
tasks are handled by earlier layers while more complex ones require
deeper processing. 

 ANOMALY DETECTION IN 3D OBJECTS (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SplatPose addresses the challenge of anomaly detection in 3D objects
from various poses with a novel approach that uses 3D Gaussian
splatting.
