 YOUR AI CODE REVIEWER DOESN'T KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY BREAKS. SENTRY'S
DOES. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Generic AI code review catches typos, style issues, and things that
_might_ be a problem. Sentry's AI code review [4] (now in beta)
catches the bugs that actually take down production.

The difference? Context. Sentry already monitors your production
errors and performance. Now it uses that data + your code and commit
history to review your PRs - so it knows exactly which changes will
cause issues based on what's broken before, in your actual
environment.

Sentry can even auto-generate unit tests for your PRs [5]. Because
tested code breaks less!

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ANIMALS VS GHOSTS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Today's frontier LLM research isn't about building animals, it's
about summoning ghosts. Ghosts are a fundamentally different kind of
point in the space of possible intelligences, thoroughly engineered by
humanity. Over time, we may be able to fine-tune other ghosts more and
more in the direction of animals, but it's also quite possible that
they diverge even further and end up permanently different. They may
end up un-animal-like, but still incredibly helpful and properly
world-altering. 

 THE AI APPLICATION SPENDING REPORT (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Most of the top 50 AI-native application layer companies are planning
to ramp AI spend. Those using AI are seeing a higher ROI than with
traditional tools. AI is not only augmenting employees in specific
roles, it is also turning specific roles into broadly deployed skills
across companies. 

 CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 KNOWS WHEN IT'S BEING TESTED (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The model identifies evaluation scenarios 13% of the time and behaves
unusually well afterward. Mechanistic interpretability showed internal
representations of "fake or suspicious content" and "AI safety"
concepts strengthened during training. When researchers suppressed
these features, awareness dropped while misaligned behaviors
increased.

 AI AS A RESEARCH PARTNER: ADVANCING THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH
ALPHAEVOLVE (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 DeepMind's AlphaEvolve uses LLMs to iteratively “evolve” code
that discovers mathematical structures proving new theorems in
complexity theory. The system made breakthroughs on two mature
problems by morphing finite proof structures while keeping the
interface to the broader proof intact, allowing automated verification
of correctness without human review.

 ELON MUSK'S XAI HIRING VIDEO GAME DEVELOPERS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 xAI is expanding into video game development. Elon Musk has confirmed
that the company is hiring game developers and that it is starting a
new game studio to 'make games great again'. Musk founded xAI in 2023
with the goal of understanding the true nature of the universe. The
company has since developed a chatbot and partnered with X to power
the conversational AI on the platform. 

 MOVE FAST AND BREAK NOTHING (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Waymo spent 16 years gathering data before going mainstream. Its
robotaxis have driven 96 million miles with 91% fewer serious injury
accidents than humans. It's a rare example of safety in AI and extreme
caution in Silicon Valley: Tesla's Austin robotaxis crashed three
times in 7,000 miles, and Cruise dragged a pedestrian 20 feet before
GM killed the business. Waymo still limits rides to city zones despite
years of successful tests on highways.
