 AMPLITUDE AI, YOUR UNFAIR ADVANTAGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You're probably being asked to “use AI” more, but finding real
impact is still harder than it sounds. 

That's why we're launching a new AI Analytics platform, designed to
understand how your customers actually behave and turn that
intelligence into action for your whole team. 

Join us for our launch event [4] on March 5 to learn how Agents can
10x your productivity as always-on teammates: monitoring dashboards,
analyzing behavior, and triggering action so you can deliver faster
wins.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT DEVELOPS COPILOT ADVISORS TO DEBATE ON ANY TOPIC (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Microsoft is developing Copilot Advisors for debating any topic using
AI personas like legal or finance experts. Users choose two agents who
argue with distinct voices, possibly with animated portraits. This
feature aims to enhance individual analysis and decision-making by
presenting strong cases from both sides. 

 CLAUDE CODE SECURITY RESEARCH PREVIEW (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic introduced Claude Code Security in a limited research
preview, enabling automated scans of codebases to surface
context-dependent vulnerabilities and propose targeted patches for
human review. 

 ANTHROPIC RESEARCH: MEASURING AI AGENT AUTONOMY IN PRACTICE (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Anthropic announced the release of its improved Claude LLM, focusing
on enhanced safety and performance. The update includes better
handling of complex queries and increased integration capabilities for
businesses. This aims to provide improved utility in various
professional applications.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE FILE SYSTEM IS THE NEW DATABASE: HOW I BUILT A PERSONAL OS FOR AI
AGENTS (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Personal Brain OS is a file-based personal operating system that
lives inside a Git repository designed to stop agents from forgetting
important context information. It contains everything the AI assistant
needs to recreate users' voice, brand, goals, content pipeline,
research, and more. This article discusses how Personal Brain OS was
built, why the architectural decisions matter, and the lessons the
developer learned the hard way. The full architecture is available for
anyone to clone and make their own. 

 WHY DEVELOPERS KEEP CHOOSING CLAUDE OVER EVERY OTHER AI (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Developers keep choosing Claude Code because the alternatives keep
failing them in the same way. Generating correct code is a major part
of the job, but it isn't everything. Agents still need to edit files
without corrupting the surrounding code, read the right files before
making changes, complete multistep tasks without losing threads
halfway through, know when to ask questions, and more, something no
other coding agent does consistently. Claude Code stays on track more
than other tools, making it the preferred choice.

 OPENAI FIRST PROOF SUBMISSIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI detailed its end-to-end proof attempts on all ten First Proof
research problems, a domain-specific challenge designed to test
whether AI systems can produce fully checkable mathematical arguments.
The post outlined evaluation feedback from field experts, revisions to
earlier correctness claims, and included a preprint with all proofs
plus an appendix documenting prompt patterns used to simulate
iterative human–model collaboration. 

 THE CODING AGENT IS DEAD (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The current generation of coding agents isn't the future. The newest
models can be powerful with nearly any tool thrown at them, with bash
often being enough. Codebase organization is now the bottleneck. Amp
plans to kill the Amp editor extensions for VS Code and Cursor on
March 5. It will continue to work on the Amp CLI, which is flexible,
light, easy to change, and can be run anywhere at anytime. 

 ALPHAEVOLVE DISCOVERS NEW MULTI-AGENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS (26 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Using an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models,
the work automatically generated new algorithms for
imperfect-information games across CFR and PSRO paradigms. The
discovered VAD-CFR and SHOR-PSRO variants introduced adaptive
discounting and hybrid optimistic meta-solvers, showing improved
empirical convergence over strong baselines.

 LEVERAGING OPENCLAW AS A WEB DEVELOPER (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Web developers can integrate OpenClaw to automate repetitive tasks
like scaffolding routes, generating tests, and updating documentation
directly from natural‑language prompts. Developers with domain
context can teach OpenClaw project‑specific patterns that improve
code quality and consistency without manual intervention. 

 CHATGPT ADS NOW HIT ON YOUR VERY FIRST MESSAGE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI is now testing ads in ChatGPT for Free and Go users in the US,
with companies like Expedia and Qualcomm appearing after a user's
first message. The beta charges $60 CPM with a $200,000 minimum
investment, only including large-budget brands, and excludes paid
subscribers.
