HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 RUNWAY'S GEN 3 VIDEO MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Runway has trained an extremely powerful new video generation model.
It will power many of the existing features on its platform. Examples
are available in the provided link. 

 DEEPMIND'S NEW AI GENERATES SOUNDTRACKS AND DIALOGUE FOR VIDEOS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepMind is developing an AI technology called V2A to generate
synchronized soundtracks for videos. It uses diffusion models trained
on audio, dialogue transcripts, and video clips to create music, sound
effects, and dialogue. 

 GIANT CHIPS GIVE SUPERCOMPUTERS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Cerebras, a California-based company, has demonstrated that its
second-generation wafer-scale engine is significantly faster than the
world's faster supercomputer in molecular dynamics calculations. It
can also perform sparse large language model inference at one-third of
the energy cost of a full model without losing any accuracy. Both
achievements are possible due to the interconnects and fast memory
access enabled by Cerebras' hardware. Cerebras is looking to extend
the applications of its wafer-scale engine to a larger class of
problems, including molecular dynamics simulations of biological
processes and simulations of airflow around vehicles.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEPTH ANYTHING V2 (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The new Depth Anything model was trained primarily on synthetic data
and has dramatically improved performance on complex scenes. 

 DEEPSEEK CODER V2 (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 DeepSeek Coder is a powerful model that gets 90+ on HumanEval while
matching GPT-4 Turbo performance on many other challenging benchmarks.
It is available through an API and free for commercial use. 

 HELPSTEER2: OPEN-SOURCE DATASET FOR TRAINING TOP-PERFORMING REWARD
MODELS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nvidia has released a dataset and recipe along with a high quality
paper about training reward models to align model output to human
preferences.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HOW TO EMBED AI SEARCH INTO YOUR WEB APP (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Enhance your search experience with AI while maintaining flexibility
and deep control over your architecture and UI. Read the blog [10] for
a tech overview, or visit the Algolia Code Exchange [11] to access
frontend and UI components, and to explore open source AI search
projects built by the Algolia community. Get started [11] 

 DIFFERENTIABLE RASTERIZATION (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Everything should be differentiable. This post walks through how to
write differentiable SVG lite. 

 LARS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LARS is an application that enables you to run LLMs locally on your
device. Upload your own documents and engage in conversations where
the LLM grounds its responses with your uploaded content. 

 HALLUCINATIONS IN DIFFUSION-BASED IMAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This paper investigates why diffusion-based image generation models
create "hallucinations" ‚Äî images that never appeared in the training
data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEP DIVE: BEYOND THE BASICS OF RAG (48 MINUTE VIDEO) [15] 

 The creator of RAGatouille gave an excellent talk discussing how to
dramatically improve RAG performance, some of the open challenges, and
COLBERT. 

 LOGICAL REASONING IN LANGUAGE MODELS (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chain of Preference Optimization (CPO) is a method that improves the
logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). By
fine-tuning LLMs using search trees from the Tree-of-Thought (ToT)
method, CPO aligns the reasoning steps of Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
decoding with ToT's optimal paths. 

 GENERAL INTELLIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 What would it take to make a generally intelligent agent and what are
we missing? This post explores the 3 ideas needed to make an agent and
posits that we are only a few years away. The author is a researcher
at OpenAI.
