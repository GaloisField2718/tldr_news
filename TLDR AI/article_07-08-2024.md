 LEARN HOW TO FINE-TUNE META'S NEW SEGMENT ANYTHING MODEL 2 (SAM 2)
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Last week, Meta AI launched SAM 2 - a new, open foundation model [4]
that enables the precise segmentation of any object in any video or
image.

Just 24 hours later, Encord became the first platform to integrate SAM
2 for automated data labeling [4], with initial benchmarks showing 6x
performance increases [4].

But does SAM 2 work on YOUR data?

Join the upcoming Encord webinar [4] to learn more about SAM 2's
exciting new capabilities, how you can use it for automated data
labeling, and even how to fine-tune SAM 2 [4] on your domain-specific
data.

downstream deterministic programs. 

 META IS REPORTEDLY OFFERING MILLIONS TO USE HOLLYWOOD VOICES IN AI
PROJECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is negotiating with celebrities like Awkwafina and Judi Dench to
use their voices for its AI digital assistant, seeking extensive usage
rights across its platforms. Striking a deal could mean millions in
fees for the actors, with safeguards from SAG-AFTRA for AI-generated
likenesses. The company aims to present these AI features at its
Connect conference in September, after recently canceling a celebrity
voice chatbot project.

 I'M SWITCHING INTO AI SAFETY (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 After eight years on Google's robotics team, Alex Irpan has
transitioned to the AI safety team at Google DeepMind, driven by a mix
of personal reasons and a belief in the importance of addressing
safety challenges as AI systems advance towards superhuman
capabilities. They express concerns about the reliability of current
AI safety measures, the increasing risks of unchecked AI development,
and their commitment to contributing to AI safety, despite the
complexities and controversies surrounding the field. 

 WITH SMUGGLERS AND FRONT COMPANIES, CHINA IS SKIRTING AMERICAN A.I.
BANS (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Despite U.S. restrictions aimed at preventing the export of AI chips
to China, an active black market thrives, allowing sizable
transactions like a reported $103 million deal involving Nvidia chips.
Efforts to circumvent bans involve creating new companies, deceptive
shipping practices, and relying on international distribution gaps.
The underground trade persists, catalyzing debates over the
effectiveness of U.S. export controls and their impact on American
tech companies versus Chinese competitors. 

 GPT-5: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (55 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This in-depth analysis of OpenAI's GPT-5 explores its potential
improvements in reasoning, agents, and multimodality while considering
OpenAI's technical and business challenges in the competitive AI
landscape. It analyzes GPT-5's anticipated advancements and market
expectations, forecasting that while GPT-5 will enhance existing
capabilities, it may fall short of becoming a fully autonomous AI
agent. OpenAI's holistic approach is expected to push the boundaries
of large language models and maintain its influence in the AI
industry.
