 AI IS CREATING A GOLDEN AGE FOR SCAMMERS. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET YOUR
PERSONAL DETAILS OFF THE WEB (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Odds are, you've received a suspicious phone call, text, or email
asking for money. The scam might have been easy to spot ‚Äî but with
deepfakes and genAI, things are getting much weirder.

Sophisticated scams start with bad actors laying hands on your
personal data. Often, they purchase this data legally from data
brokers [4] who profit from selling your phone number, DOB, SSN, and
more.

Incogni [4] scrubs your personal data from the web, confronting the
180+ data brokers on your behalf. And unlike other services, Incogni
helps remove your sensitive information from ALL broker types [4],
including people search sites.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE TO LAUNCH ‚ÄúAPPLE INTELLIGENCE‚Äù (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple is set to introduce its AI initiatives under the brand name
"Apple Intelligence" in iOS 18 and other operating systems, focusing
on daily life enhancements rather than creative tasks. Features will
include AI-generated notification summaries, rich auto-replies in
Messages and Mail, intelligent email categorization, an emoji creator,
AI-powered photo editing, and transcriptions in Voice Memos. 

 CLAUDE'S CHARACTER (37 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude is more than just a middle-of-the-road, sycophantic AI that
agrees with the user. Claude's personality and character have been
specifically designed using a character variant of Constitutional AI.
This post goes in-depth on how post-training is used to steer the type
of output often generated by Claude to represent this desired
character. 

 DATABRICKS + TABULAR (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Databricks has acquired Tabular, uniting key contributors to Apache
Iceberg and Delta Lake to focus on data format compatibility for its
lakehouse architecture. The goal is to achieve a single open standard
for data interoperability to prevent data silos, starting with Delta
Lake UniForm's compatibility solution.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMPROVING MODEL WITH SYNTHETIC DATA (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have developed a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA)
framework to enhance test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. SDA
effectively aligns source and synthetic domains by fine-tuning
pretrained models with synthetic data generated through a conditional
diffusion model. 

 BOOSTING TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS WITH RENO (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO) is a new approach to enhance
Text-to-Image (T2I) models during inference that optimizes the initial
noise using signals from human preference reward models. 

 OBJECT DETECTION WITH OPEN-VOCABULARY CAPABILITIES (16 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Researchers have upgraded the popular YOLO object detectors with
YOLO-World, introducing open-vocabulary detection. This approach
combines vision-language modeling and large-scale dataset training,
allowing it to identify a vast array of objects quickly and
accurately, even in scenarios it wasn't specifically trained for.

 SPREADSHEET IS ALL YOU NEED (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 GPT-2 style transformer model contained entirely in a spreadsheet
that includes all weights, parameters, and connections. It is a small
model based on NanoGPT that is entirely contained in the rows and
columns of a spreadsheet. 

 INSPECTUS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Inspectus is a versatile visualization tool for large language models
that offers diverse insights into language model behaviors. 

 CAMERA LOCALIZATION WITH SCENE-SPECIFIC LANDMARKS (16 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Researchers have created a new privacy-friendly method for camera
localization using unique scene landmarks. This approach, which uses a
CNN-based heatmap and 3D scene landmarks, is both storage-efficient
and highly accurate, all without relying on actual 3D point clouds for
localization.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OMNIPOSE 6D BENCHMARK (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 New dataset with 700k+ images and 2m+ annotations for computer vision
6D motion estimation (e.g., positions and rotations). 

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are not databases and can
produce imprecise answers to questions, but they excel at generating
responses that appear correct. The future of AI involves integrating
LLMs into specialized tools or embedding them into existing
applications, enhancing functionality while mitigating errors and
improving user experience by contextualizing AI outputs within
specific, manageable domains. 

 SPATIAL REASONING GPT (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This model uses a number of computer vision techniques to reason
about absolute and relative sizes of objects in monocular images.
