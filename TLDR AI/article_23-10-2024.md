HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC UPGRADES SONNET AND RELEASES HAIKU 3.5 (16 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Anthropic has upgraded Sonnet 3.5's performance and released a
cost-effective model that matches the old Claude 3 Opus' performance.
Additionally, Sonnet 3.5 has been trained to use computers and click
on things using screen recordings. 

 STABLE DIFFUSION 3.5 (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stability AI has released a new series of models with improved
performance and speed. They have Diffusers support with training out
of the gate.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 AUTOMATICALLY INTERPRETING MILLIONS OF FEATURES IN LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Interpreting SAE features is challenging at scale. Eleuther has
released a set of auto interpreter features to figure out what things
mean in context. 

 CAMERA CONTROL IN TEXT-TO-VIDEO DIFFUSION MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Epipolar attention improves camera control in text-to-video models by
integrating physical constraints. This new approach tracks frame
relationships even with noise and rapid movement, overcoming the
limitations of previous methods. 

 3D FACE GEOMETRY FROM A SINGLE IMAGE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a new method for estimating face texture and
geometry from a single image using StyleGAN and 3D Morphable Models.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ONE-HOUR AI: KICKSTART YOUR PROJECT WITH NVIDIA AI WORKBENCH
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 This webinar series dives into local AI development—from data prep
to training models to deployment—using Dell Precision workstations
powered by NVIDIA RTX(TM) GPUs. The upcoming live session featuring
Tyler Whitehouse from NVIDIA [10] will cover key features, how to get
started quickly, and how to complete your first AI workflow in <1
hour. See you there [10] 

 FAST AND ACCURATE SPEECH TO TEXT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Gold standard release of a powerful edge automatic speech recognition
system. 

 PHONE APP TO RUN LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Pocket Pal is one of the better ways to run language models on mobile
devices. The code has recently been released as open source. 

 REDUCING OBJECT HALLUCINATION IN LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB
REPO) [13] 

 Object hallucination in vision-language models is linked to Rotary
Position Encoding (RoPE), which struggles with long-term dependencies
between visual and text inputs. To address this, these authors propose
Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a new positional alignment strategy
that improves the interaction between visual and instruction tokens.

 THE SECOND $100B AI COMPANY (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article predicts that by 2034, new AI companies driven by
advancements in AI applications, especially in consumer AI, will join
OpenAI in surpassing a $100B market cap. Despite the current dominance
of established tech giants in the AI infrastructure and model layers,
the application layer remains ripe for innovation and growth,
presenting opportunities for consumer AI to thrive. The potential for
large-scale success in consumer AI, particularly in areas like video
creation, online shopping, and gaming, mirrors previous tech
revolutions in cloud and mobile sectors. 

 INTRODUCING THE PROMPT() FUNCTION: USE THE POWER OF LLMS WITH SQL! (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The costs of running LLMs have significantly decreased, enabling the
practical integration of small models like gpt-4o-mini into SQL
functions. MotherDuck's PROMPT() function allows for streamlined text
generation, summarization, and structured data extraction using OpenAI
models. It offers flexibility in cost and performance and supports
bulk operations with enhanced concurrency for efficient processing. 

 USE PROLOG TO IMPROVE LLM'S REASONING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Current techniques like CoT and incorporating programming languages
like Prolog can enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, addressing the
limitations of autoregressive models. The "Reliable Reasoning Beyond
Natural Language" paper introduces a neurosymbolic method that uses
Prolog to convert requests into symbolic logic, improving
explainability and problem-solving. ProSLM has demonstrated
significant improvements on datasets, showing promising results for
integrating Prolog with LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.
