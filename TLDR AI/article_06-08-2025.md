 THIS $1.3T MARKET DISRUPTOR JUST PASSED $110M IN GROSS PROFIT. INVEST
AT $2.90/SHARE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pacaso [4] has built a tech platform that simplifies co-ownership of
vacation homes — a market worth $1.3 _trillion_.

Their model has:

 	* 41% YoY gross profit growth.
 	* $110M+ in gross profit to date.
 	* $1B+ in processed transactions and fees.
 	* Just announced further expansion [4] into Italy, the Caribbean,
and Mexico.

This is a rare SEC-qualified public offering where retail investors
can buy early-stage shares alongside the same VCs that backed Uber,
Venmo, and eBay.

The Nasdaq ticker _PCSO_ is already reserved. Global expansion is
happening now.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI RELEASED OPEN-WEIGHT GPT-OSS MODELS (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI released gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, two high-performance
open-weight models under Apache 2.0. They rival proprietary models on
reasoning and tool use, are optimized for efficient deployment, and
meet strong safety standards through adversarial testing and expert
review. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic's incremental update to Opus 4 brings a small boost in
coding performance with particular improvements in multi-file
refactoring and precise debugging within large codebases. 

 GENIE 3: A NEW FRONTIER FOR WORLD MODELS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DeepMind's latest world model generates interactive 3D environments
from text prompts at 24fps in 720p, maintaining visual consistency for
several minutes. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STRONG WINDS, BIG SAILS: WHY CLINE WINS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cline's model-agnostic architecture lets it ride two powerful
tailwinds—better models and cheaper inference—rather than fighting
frontier progress. The open-source coding assistant uses transparent
pass-through pricing, automatically giving users the best available
performance without margin-padding that plagues subscription
competitors. 

 BUILDING THE #1 OPEN SOURCE TERMINAL-USE AGENT USING LETTA (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Letta built an open source agent for terminal use that ranked 4th
overall on Terminal-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents on
real-world command-line tasks focused on real-world complexity. The
startup provides a stateful agents API layer that is compatible with
any model and provides tools for managing the context window over
time. Its terminal-use agent uses Letta's built-in capabilities for
context management and memory, specifically memory blocks. Agent
developers can use Letta to rapidly specialize agents for specific
tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 CATCH SILENT LLM FAILURES BEFORE USERS NOTICE WITH SENTRY'S AI AGENT
MONITORING - NOW GA (SPONSOR) [10] 

 What broke your agent? Was it an API error, rate limits, or just the
model flaking out? Traditional monitoring doesn't know; Sentry's AI
Agent Monitoring [11] traces complete workflows - prompts, tool calls,
model responses - with real-time alerts when things go south. Try it
[11] 

 MEET YOUR NEW AI CODING TEAMMATE: GEMINI CLI GITHUB ACTIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Gemini CLI GitHub Actions is an AI coding teammate that acts as both
an autonomous agent for critical routine coding tasks and an on-demand
collaborator to quickly delegate work to. It can be triggered by
events like new issues or pull requests. Gemini CLI GitHub Actions
works asynchronously in the background, using the full context of a
project to automatically handle tasks. It is now in beta and available
to everyone worldwide. 

 INTRODUCING AI GROUNDING WITH BRAVE SEARCH API, PROVIDING ENHANCED
SEARCH PERFORMANCE IN AI APPLICATIONS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brave has launched AI Grounding with the Brave Search API, an
all-in-one solution for connecting AI system outputs to verifiable
data sources. AI Grounding anchors responses from large language
models to factual information from verifiable web sources, reducing
hallucinations and increasing appropriate responses to nuanced inputs.
The AI Grounding plan is priced at $4 per thousand web searches plus
$5 per million tokens (input and output). It can be accessed via the
Pro AI plan with no change in price. 

 CODE INDEX MCP (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Code Index MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps
large language models index, search, and analyze code repositories
with minimal setup. It transforms how AI understands codebases with
advanced search, analysis, and navigation capabilities. Code Index MCP
is perfect for code review, refactoring, documentation generation,
debugging assistance, and architectural analysis. It has support for a
range of mainstream languages, mobile development platforms, web
frontends, databases, and systems. 

 XBAI O4 MODEL RELEASE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 MetaStone AI released XBai o4, its fourth-generation open-source
model, which now outperforms OpenAI-o3-mini in Medium mode. The model
focuses on complex reasoning tasks and introduces a scalable, parallel
test-time inference framework. 

 FEATURE CORRELATIONS AND MEMORY CAPACITY IN DAMS (4 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Structured input data affects the memory capacity of Dense
Associative Memory models. Using datasets with varying feature
correlation and Hamming distance, the study finds that while
separation increases capacity exponentially, correlated features
slightly reduce it.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT WE'RE OPTIMIZING CHATGPT FOR (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ChatGPT will now have session break reminders. OpenAI is consulting
physicians and mental health experts to improve model behavior. It
emphasized that its focus is on helping users accomplish their goals
rather than maximizing time on the platform or model agreeableness. 

 FOR THE FIRST TIME, OPENAI MODELS ARE AVAILABLE ON AWS (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Before the release of its open source models, OpenAI models were only
available on Azure. AWS has been losing AI cloud market share to
Microsoft due to this exclusivity deal, but this new partnership
signals OpenAI's shifting relationship with Microsoft as it seeks
additional capacity beyond what Azure alone can provide.
