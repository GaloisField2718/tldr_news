 NVIDIA LAUNCHES GPT-4 QUALITY MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 NVIDIA's Nemotron-4 340B is a family of open models that developers
can use to generate synthetic data for training LLMs for commercial
applications. The state-of-the-art reward model matches the original
GPT-4 model and can run on 8 H100s. 

 APPLE TO ‚ÄòPAY' OPENAI FOR CHATGPT THROUGH DISTRIBUTION, NOT CASH (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple and OpenAI's partnership isn't expected to generate meaningful
revenue for either party, at least at the beginning. Apple believes
that pushing OpenAI's brand and technology to its devices is of equal
or greater value than monetary payments so it isn't paying OpenAI as
part of the deal. The deal isn't exclusive - Apple is already
discussing offering other chatbots as additional options. Apple
eventually plans to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing
agreements with AI partners. 

 AI WILL MAKE MONEY SOONER THAN YOU'D THINK (54 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article contains a transcript of an interview with Aidan Gomez,
CEO of Cohere, where he discusses Cohere's path to profitability, the
benefit of competition in the enterprise space, AI's current
abilities, the future of large language models, and more.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MASKED DIFFUSION LANGUAGE MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Simple diffusion model for language modeling. It generates out of
order and works quite well. 

 JAILBREAK ATTACKS ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers are addressing the vulnerability of Large Language Models
to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate models to produce harmful
outputs. 

 EFFICIENT TRANSFORMER WITH KEY-VALUE SHARING (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing is a new method that
significantly reduces memory usage during auto-regressive inference in
transformers.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LLAMA 3 8B MATCHES GPT 4 MATH PERFORMANCE WITH MCTS (GITHUB REPO)
[10] 

 The current Holy Grail of research is figuring out how to integrate
search into language model generation. This work is extremely
promising and shows that small models with search can match much more
powerful models on math performance. 

 VIDEO UNDERSTANDING WITH VIDEOGPT+ (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 VideoGPT+ is a model that combines image and video encoders to
enhance video understanding. Image encoders capture detailed spatial
information, while video encoders provide temporal context. 

 SCENE GRAPH GENERATION IN SATELLITE IMAGERY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This project introduces a new dataset and framework to improve Scene
Graph Generation (SGG) for very-high-resolution satellite imagery (VHR
SAI).

 FAKE BEAUTY QUEENS CHARM JUDGES AT THE MISS AI PAGEANT (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Aiyana Rainbow, a Romanian AI model, is a finalist in the inaugural
Miss AI pageant, an event that features AI-generated models on social
media. Organized by FanVue, the event is part of "The FanVue World AI
Creator Awards," which showcases AI creators' ability to generate
engaging content without being the physical face themselves. The
winner of Miss AI is set to receive $5,000, public relations support,
and mentorship. The results will be announced at the end of June. 

 NVIDIA'S NEW SALES BOOSTER: THE GLOBAL PUSH FOR NATIONAL AI CHAMPIONS
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Governments around the world are boosting their budgets to encourage
companies and multinationals to build new data centers and refit old
ones to develop AI locally and train large language models in their
native languages based on their own citizens' data. Nvidia says that
these sovereign AI efforts are expected to bring in almost $10 billion
this year. Many governments are concerned about how generative AI will
impact their economies. They want sovereign clouds for their AI
infrastructure and sensitive data, and US tech companies are eager to
build those for them.
