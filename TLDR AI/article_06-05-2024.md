HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LAMINI AI $25M SERIES A (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Lamini, an Enterprise AI platform, makes it possible for software
teams within enterprises to develop new LLM capabilities that reduce
hallucinations on proprietary data, run their LLMs securely from cloud
VPCs to on-premise, and scale their infrastructure with model
evaluations that prioritize ROI and business outcomes over hype. It
raised a $25M Series A led by Amplify Partners. 

 MICROSOFT-BACKED OPENAI MAY LAUNCH SEARCH, TAKING ON GOOGLE'S
'BIGGEST PRODUCT' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is reportedly planning a major announcement on May 9, possibly
unveiling a new search engine that could challenge Google. This engine
may use Microsoft Bing's infrastructure, aligning with OpenAI CEO Sam
Altman's vision of revolutionizing information discovery beyond the
current Google model. If true, this could significantly disrupt the
search engine market and how users find information online. 

 FROM BABY TALK TO BABY A.I. (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dr. Brenden Lake of NYU aims to bridge human cognitive studies and AI
by recording his daughter's POV to develop a language model,
challenging the current AI approach that relies heavily on large
datasets. This work explores how AI can learn from the sensory input
akin to a toddler's experience. The research could lead to AI capable
of conceptual mapping through association, similar to human language
acquisition.

generation quality. Prometheus is a model built on top of Mistral that
performs extremely well on this task. 

 ENHANCING MEDICAL IMAGING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Researchers have developed a new algorithm called RaffeSDG that
improves the accuracy of medical imaging models when analyzing data
from different sources. 

 GENERATE SYNTHETIC INSTRUCTION DATASETS FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATASETS
(GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Bonito is a model and toolkit designed to take unstructured text as
input and create certain types of instruction datasets like question
answering, instructions, and summarization.
