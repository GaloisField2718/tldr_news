HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE ACQUIRES Q.AI (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup that specializes in
audio-focused AI, to advance features like whispered speech
recognition and audio enhancement for products like AirPods and Vision
Pro. 

 AMAZON COULD INVEST UP TO $50 BILLION IN OPENAI IN COMING WEEKS,
SOURCE SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Amazon is negotiating a potential $50 billion investment in OpenAI,
highlighting a strategic shift towards AI. Talks involve OpenAI CEO
Sam Altman and Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy, with potential agreements
including the use of Amazon's AI chips. This comes despite Amazon's
prior investments in Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, and forms part of a
broader $100 billion fundraising round spearheaded by OpenAI.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 👀 INSIDE OPENAI'S UNIT ECONOMICS (25 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The finances of the GPT-5 bundle are worse than what Sam Altman and
Dario Amodei suggest. Other labs are probably in a similar boat.
However, AI models don't need to be profitable today, as long as
companies can convince investors that they will be in the future. The
sheer scale of value that AI could create is one reason to be really
bullish about AI's long-run profitability. 

 INSIDE OPENAI'S IN-HOUSE DATA AGENT (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI uses a bespoke in-house AI data agent that explores and
reasons over its platform. It lets employees go from question to
insight in minutes, allowing them to answer high-impact data
questions. The agent was built specifically around OpenAI's data,
permissions, and workflows. This post details how it was built to
demonstrate how AI can support day-to-day work across teams. The tools
used to build the AI data agent are available to all developers. 

 APPLE'S AI GAME IS MISUNDERSTOOD (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Some say Apple is behind on AI, while others say Apple is playing a
different game. The gap between these two realities is where
investment risk lives. Apple is likely building a moat where inference
is free, privacy is structural, and the capex already happened when
users bought the hardware. The next three years will tell us whether
that's wisdom or complacency. 

 $281B FROM ONE CUSTOMER (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Microsoft's Q2 FY2026 earnings beat expectations across revenue,
earnings per share, and Azure growth, yet the stock fell 11% after
earnings. Demand is outpacing Microsoft's ability to build, so the
company is accelerating its spending. Microsoft's commercial remaining
performance obligation surged to $625 billion in Q2, with $281 billion
coming from OpenAI, a substantial risk. Microsoft's strength indicates
an insatiable demand for inference and increasing customer
concentration risk for even the largest businesses in the world. 

 RL ENVIRONMENTS FOR AGENTIC AI: WHO WILL WIN THE TRAINING &
VERIFICATION LAYER BY 2030 (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The winners in RL environments will be the teams that build real
infrastructure. This has to be done in close partnership with frontier
labs to industrialize replication training, verification, and
long-horizon environment orchestration. There will likely be three to
five significant winners. The market may end up resembling data
labeling, which already has roughly three over-$1 billion-revenue
players.

 AGENTS THAT DON'T SUCK (SPONSOR) [16] 

 Agent Bricks [17] helps you build, evaluate and optimize AI agents
grounded in your unique data. It evaluates automatically, scores
outputs against your goals and improves with human feedback — giving
you a clearer path to production. Build agents that work in the real
world.

 AGENT TRACE: CAPTURING THE CONTEXT GRAPH OF CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [18]


 Agent Trace is an open, vendor-neutral spec for recording AI
contributions alongside human authorship in version-controlled
codebases. It attributes each change to a specific conversation and
line range, meaning repositories associated with Agent Traces will
always be able to link back to the context that created it. The system
makes development legible and could enable some pretty powerful
management-level dashboards and data-driven decisions. Agent Traces
are the beginning of a new era where the precious resource is context.


 SECURE CODEBASE INDEXING (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Semantic search can be sped up in large codebases by securely reusing
existing indexes across team members. This optimization can reduce
time-to-first-query from hours to seconds. 

 GROK IMAGINE API (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Grok Imagine API is a unified bundle of powerful APIs designed for
end-to-end creative workflows. Grok imagine features state-of-the-art
video generation across quality, cost, and latency. It can bring
images to life and even refine flex cinematic sequences. Examples of
videos generated with the model are available in the article. 

 EVOLVING REPRESENTATIONS IN LANGUAGE MODELS (22 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Google researchers reveal how internal model representations shift
over conversations, showing that concepts like factuality are fluid
and context-dependent, with implications for model steering and
interpretability.

 BUILDING AIS THAT DO HUMAN-LIKE PHILOSOPHY (38 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Building AIs that can do human-like philosophy could prove an
especially subtle and hard-to-evaluate challenge. There are a variety
of strategies that are now possible that could make real progress in
the area. This essay looks at different angles of attack to help
inspire efforts to tackle the change. Philosophy is hard, and solving
it is likely to require some very sophisticated philosophical
achievement. 

 RETIRING GPT-4O AND OLDER MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and certain other older models will be
retired on February 13 to streamline capabilities and transition users
toward newer generations like GPT-5 and beyond. GPT-4o in ChatGPT had
been restored after earlier deprecation due to user feedback, but the
final retirement reflects broader adoption of more capable models.
While the change affects the consumer ChatGPT experience, there are
currently no simultaneous API changes, and developers relying on older
models will be guided to migrate to newer alternatives as part of
normal deprecation practices.

 FACT CHECKING MORAVEC'S PARADOX (15 MINUTE READ) [27] 

 Moravec's paradox, an endlessly repeated aphorism that tasks that are

statement on what the AI community finds worthwhile to work on and
doesn't have any predictive power about which problems are going to be
easy or hard for AI.

plans to launch Qwen 3.5, a flagship AI model optimized for complex
reasoning tasks.
