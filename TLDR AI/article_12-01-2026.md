 STOP BOTS FROM ABUSING FREE TRIALS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials help AI apps grow, but bots and fake accounts exploit
them [5]. They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users. 

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [4] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and
behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

 ANTHROPIC CRACKS DOWN ON UNAUTHORIZED CLAUDE USAGE BY THIRD-PARTY
HARNESSES AND RIVALS (9 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has implemented strict new technical safeguards to prevent
third-party applications from spoofing Claude Code to access more
favorable pricing and limits. Ensuring model integrity now requires
routing all automated agents through the official Commercial API or
the Claude Code client. The company has also restricted the usage of
its AI models by rival labs. Security directors should audit internal
tool chains to ensure they aren't violating commercial terms and that
all automated workflows are authenticated via proper enterprise keys. 

 META UNVEILS SWEEPING NUCLEAR-POWER PLAN TO FUEL ITS AI AMBITIONS (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta has unveiled a series of agreements that will make it an anchor
customer for new and existing nuclear power in the US. The company
will back new reactor projects with TerraPower and Oklo and has struck
a deal with the power producer Vistra to purchase and expand the
generation output of three existing nuclear plants. The first new
reactors are expected to be delivered as early as 2030 and 2032.
Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed.

 BEST PRACTICES FOR CODING WITH AGENTS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tips for maximizing productivity with coding agents, including how to
structure problems, guide multi-file changes, and ensure agents
iterate effectively on code until tests pass. 

 GLOBAL AI COMPUTING CAPACITY IS DOUBLING EVERY 7 MONTHS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Total available capacity from AI chips across all major designers has
grown approximately 3.3 times per year since 2022. This has enabled
larger-scale model development and consumer adoption. Nvidia AI chips
currently account for over 60% of total compute. Google and Amazon
make up much of the remainder. 

 USE MULTIPLE MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Problems with AI models can often be solved by passing the same query
to a peer model. This suggests that models are actually quite close to
being able to solve many tasks, but they're just not there yet. For
switching to regularly solve tasks, each model must have a fairly high
probability of success. The next generation of models will be even
more capable.

 AGENTS THAT DON'T SUCK (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Agent Bricks [12] helps you build, evaluate and optimize AI agents
grounded in your unique data. It evaluates automatically, scores
outputs against your goals and improves with human feedback — giving
you a clearer path to production. Build agents that work in the real
world.

 UNDER THE HOOD: UNIVERSAL COMMERCE PROTOCOL (UCP) (19 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) is an open-source standard that
enables seamless commerce journeys between customer surfaces,
businesses, and payment providers. It works with existing retail
infrastructure and is compatible with the Agents Payments Protocol.
The UCP provides businesses with flexible ways to integrate via APIs,
Agent2Agent, and the Model Context Protocol. It was developed by
Google in collaboration with industry leaders. 

 AGENT DESIGN PATTERNS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 We are getting closer to long-running autonomous agents. However,
models get worse as context grows. Effective agent design largely
boils down to context management. This post explores common design
patterns across agents. 

 EVALUATING AI AGENTS IN PRODUCTION (28 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's practical approaches to agent evaluation emphasize
pre-deployment tests that simulate real-world conditions and reduce
failures in complex, multi-turn agent systems. 

 DEEP THINK WITH CONFIDENCE (23 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta AI researchers developed DeepThink with Confidence (DeepConf), a
technique that uses internal confidence signals to cut LLM reasoning
overhead by up to 84.7% while maintaining accuracy. The method
monitors token-level confidence to terminate low-quality reasoning
traces early, particularly when models generate uncertainty markers
like "wait" or "think again."

 AGENT-NATIVE ARCHITECTURES AND THE SHIFT BEYOND CODE (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Agent-native architectures replace step-by-step code with agents that
decide how to achieve outcomes, while developers define only the
desired results through prompts. This model makes software faster to
build and adapt, since behavior changes come from modifying language
instead of rewriting logic. The shift trades predictability for
flexibility, pushing software design toward continuous pruning and
observation rather than rigid control. 

 IN AI AGENTS, TRACES ARE THE SOURCE OF TRUTH (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 In AI agents, the code only orchestrates models and tools, while real
decision-making happens inside the model at runtime and cannot be
understood by reading the code alone. Traces capture the actual
reasoning steps, tool calls, errors, costs, and outcomes, making them
the primary artifact for debugging, testing, optimization, and
monitoring.
