 GIVE ANY AI AGENT ACCESS TO GOOGLE SEARCH WITH SERPAPI -- SPECIAL
OFFER FOR TLDR (SPONSOR) [4]

offer an API for web search results... so how are AI companies doing
it?

API [4]:

👉 Scrape Google and other search engines (including AI overviews,
Maps, Local, Shopping, and Knowledge Graph)

👉 Integrate with a dead-simple GET request that any agent can make.

👉 Used by Perplexity, NVIDIA, Uber, Adobe, and even the United
Nations.

 MUSK'S XAI LOSES SECOND CO-FOUNDER IN TWO DAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced his exit from the company on Monday,
then fellow co-founder and influential researcher Jimmy Ba announced
his departure from the company the next day. Other co-founders,
including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, and Christian Szegedy, have
also departed the company. Elon Musk launched xAI alongside 11 other
people in 2023. The company was merged with Musk's aerospace company,
SpaceX, earlier this month. 

 OPENAI'S JONY IVE-DESIGNED DEVICE DELAYED TO 2027 (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 OpenAI will not ship its first hardware device to customers before
the end of February 2027. The company has yet to create any packaging
or marketing materials for the device. OpenAI will not use the name
'io' in connection with the naming, advertising, marketing, or sale of
any of its AI-enabled hardware products. Few details are known about
OpenAI's upcoming product, but it apparently won't be an in-ear device
or a wearable.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AMERICA'S $1T AI GAMBLE (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The US economy is buoyed by the AI boom, but nowhere near entirely
driven by it. The tech industry's investments in AI have to pay off if
they hope to accelerate American growth. Most AI companies still have
massive spending capabilities from their other profitable digital
ventures, and investors can be easily tapped for additional money at
extremely high valuations. There are no signs of the American AI boom
slowing down. 

 TRACKING AI ENGINE OPTIMIZATION FOR CODING AGENTS (17 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Vercel described its AEO system for measuring how LLMs and coding
agents discover and reference its content across development
workflows. Unlike standard chat models, coding agents operate within
full project environments, requiring infrastructure that simulates
real IDE and terminal usage to evaluate search behavior and citation
accuracy. 

 WARPGREP: FAST CONTEXT RL RETRIEVAL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 WarpGrep is a lightweight RL‑trained retrieval sub‑agent that
finds the exact code files and line ranges developers need up to 5×
faster than standard models by limiting search to four turns of
parallel grep/read/glob calls. This approach keeps the main LLM's
context clean, cuts noise, and halves token usage by specializing
retrieval, not reasoning. In benchmarks on large repositories,
WarpGrep doubled precision and maintained ~5‑second search times
while reducing irrelevant context pollution.

 KIMI INTRODUCES AGENT SWARM: LET 100 AI AGENTS WORK FOR YOU (5 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Kimi Agent Swarm is an AI CEO who helps find researchers, analysts,
and fact-checkers without micromanagement. It builds an organizational
structure with bosses, employees, and divisions of labor by itself.
Agent Swarm excels where work can be parallelized, like broad
research, batch downloads, multi-file processing, multi-angle
analysis, and long-form writing. It creates the conditions for
productive disagreement to avoid groupthink structurally. Agent Swarm
is now available to Kimi Top Tier subscribers in early research
preview. 

 MORE ABOUT AGENT SKILLS (24 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI outlined a guide for agent skills, a system for packaging
reusable “skills” as versioned bundles of instructions, scripts,
and assets that agents can attach to execution environments. Skills
support conditional workflows, code execution, and reproducibility
while keeping system prompts lightweight and modular. 

 EVALUATING RESEARCH AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 AIRS-Bench contains 20 machine learning research tasks defined by
problem, dataset, and metric triplets with corresponding human SOTA
targets. It measures whether autonomous agents can develop solutions
that match or exceed published state-of-the-art results across diverse
ML domains.

 INSIDE OPENAI'S DECISION TO KILL THE AI MODEL THAT PEOPLE LOVED TOO
MUCH (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Many GPT-4o users were in shock after OpenAI's announcement to retire
the model on February 13. The model proved very sticky for users and
helped drive OpenAI's fast consumer growth. However, it was criticized
for being overly sycophantic and has been linked to cases of users
developing psychotic delusions. The model's popularity and potential
for harm both stem from its ability to build emotional connections
with users. OpenAI is reportedly scrapping the model in part due to
how difficult it is to contain its potential for harmful outcomes. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.6: SYSTEM CARD PART 2: FRONTIER ALIGNMENT (32 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Models are now in the range where they are starting to be plausibly
dangerous. Evaluations do not consistently identify dangerous
capabilities or propensities. Companies will likely not halt model
releases without an extreme reason. No one is working to become better
prepared.
