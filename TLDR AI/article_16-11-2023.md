 THIS PAINTING SOLD FOR A 5,798X PRICE APPRECIATION ‚Äì NOW YOU CAN
ACCESS THE MARKET (SPONSOR) [6] 

 When a New York City developer purchased an untitled painting for
$19,000 in 1983, he wasn‚Äôt expecting a 5,798x return on his
investment. But that's exactly what happened when he sold the Basquiat
work for a stunning $110,000,000 in 2017.¬†
Now, everyday investors are unlocking access to the very same market
thanks to the blue-chip art investing platform, Masterworks [6]. When
Masterworks sells a painting ‚Äì like the 16 it's already sold ‚Äì
investors reap their portion of the profits.¬†

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DIRECT PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION IMPROVES MODEL FACTUALITY (22 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Optimizing models according to preferences was one of the
breakthroughs that enabled the widespread adoption of ChatGPT. Similar
technologies can also be used to improve the correctness and
factuality of models, reducing errors in medical recall by over 50%. 

 OBJECT DETECTION ON SMART GLASSES (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This team created a new RISC-V hardware designed for vision and
trained an ultra-small YOLO computer vision model which enables
real-time object detection at low power and extremely low latency.

 üÜï¬†MOCKGPT: SIMULATE THE OPENAI API FOR TESTING AND DEVELOPMENT
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Developing against OpenAI APIs can be finicky and expensive. MockGPT
by WireMock [12] is a readymade mock API for ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, etc.
Use it to write and test your code without fees and frustrating wait
times ‚Äî and switch one line of code to go live with the real API.

 DEEPMIND WEATHER FORECASTING MODEL WITH WEIGHTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 DeepMind has been working on weather forecasting for a few years now.
Its most recent model, built on graph neural networks, is extremely
accurate for 10-day forecasts. DeepMind released code and weights so
you can run it locally (if you have satellite data). 

 QWEN AUDIO (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Qwen is a series of models from Alibaba Cloud. This installment is a
general-purpose audio-to-language model. It can perform a number of
tasks for music, speech, and more. 

 VIDEO FRAME INTERPOLATION WITH DISTANCE INDEXING (4 MINUTE READ) [16]


 This project introduces a new method called "distance indexing" to
improve video frame interpolation (VFI), which traditionally struggles
with predicting precise object movements. This approach clarifies
learning objectives and reduces blurriness by giving models explicit
information about the distance an object travels between frames.

 RUNNING LLMS ON A RASPBERRY PI (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Someone recently put Mistral‚Äôs 7B model into a stuffed parrot and
it made the rounds online. This post dives into the basic ideas they
used to get it working. 

 THE FUTURE OF MUSIC: HOW GENERATIVE AI IS TRANSFORMING THE MUSIC
INDUSTRY (6 MINUTE READ) [18]
