 AI IS CREATING A GOLDEN AGE FOR SCAMMERS. NOW IS THE TIME TO GET YOUR
PERSONAL DETAILS OFF THE WEB (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Odds are, you've received a suspicious phone call, text, or email
asking for money. The scam might have been easy to spot ‚Äî but with
deepfakes and genAI, things are getting much weirder.

Sophisticated scams start with bad actors laying hands on your
personal data. Often, they purchase this data legally from data
brokers [4] who profit from selling your phone number, DOB, SSN, and
more.

Incogni [4] scrubs your personal data from the web, confronting the
180+ data brokers on your behalf. And unlike other services, Incogni
helps remove your sensitive information from ALL broker types [4],
including people search sites.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 QWEN 2 LAUNCH (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Qwen 2 is a new flagship language model from Alibaba Cloud. It
slightly surpasses Llama 3 70B on benchmark performance in English
while being a better multilingual model. 

 NVIDIA EMAILS: ELON MUSK DIVERTING TESLA GPUS TO HIS OTHER COMPANIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk redirected 12,000 H100 GPUs ordered by Tesla to X. He had
told investors in April that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the
three months of the year. Tesla has been developing its own in-house
supercomputer for AI, but Musk has previously said that it would be
redundant if the company could source more H100s. X's order of 12,000
H100s will be redirected to Tesla. 

 SECURING RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ADVANCED AI (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has outlined the security architecture of its AI training
supercomputers, emphasizing the protection of sensitive model weights
and other assets using Azure-based infrastructure and Kubernetes for
orchestration.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EXTRACTING CONCEPTS FROM GPT-4 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The team at OpenAI has discovered 16 million interpretable features
in GPT-4 including price increases, algebraic rings, and who/what
correspondence. This is a great step forward for SAE interpretability
at scale. They shared the code in a companion GitHub repository. 

 DRAGONFLY VISION MODEL (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Together AI team has a novel VLM that excels at extremely high
resolution images due to its efficient architecture. 

 SELF-ATTENTION WITH CONVOLUTIONS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a novel approach called FFNification that
transforms self-attention mechanisms into more efficient token mixers
using only convolutions while keeping the query-key-value framework.

 MESOP: GRADIO COMPETITION (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has released a competitor to Gradio, a popular AI prototyping
framework. Mesop is pure Python and has slightly more composability
but is less mature than Gradio. 

 ENHANCING LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCIES IN STATE SPACE MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 GrootVL is a network that improves state space models by dynamically
generating a tree topology based on spatial relationships and input
features. 

 VISUAL GEO-LOCALIZATION WITH MULTI-MODAL LEARNING (24 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Researchers have developed a new two-stage training method to improve
Visual Geo-localization (VG), enhancing its performance in
applications like autonomous driving, augmented reality, and SLAM.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A GRAND UNIFIED THEORY OF THE AI HYPE CYCLE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The AI industry has seen several hype cycles throughout the decades,
each producing genuinely useful technology and lasting longer than the
last. Every cycle follows the process of a sigmoid curve rather than
an exponential one. All strategies for developing the technology
inevitably have a limit that doesn't take too long to find. While the
current AI hype cycle is unlike any that have come before it, it will
likely follow a similar trajectory as previous cycles. 

 AI VOICE AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Andreessen Horowitz put together a blog post and deck outlining the
state of play for AI voice agents and where it sees opportunities for
innovation and investment. It covers the currently leading
infrastructure stack and maps out the current B2B and B2C application
layer landscape. 

 ADVANCING IMPLICIT NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS WITH RELU (26 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Researchers have revisited the use of ReLU activation functions in
learning implicit neural representations (INRs). Inspired by
second-order B-spline wavelets, they introduced simple constraints to
ReLU neurons to counter spectral bias.
