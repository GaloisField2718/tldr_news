HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 QWEN 2.5 CODER 32B INSTRUCT IS HERE! (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Qwen 2.5 Coder family is a series of language models trained
specifically for code. The newest 32B parameter model is better than
GPT-4o while being small enough to run locally for many folks. It is
on par with Claude Sonnet 3.5 in many benchmarks as well. 

 X PREPARES TO OPEN AI CHATBOT 'GROK' TO FREE USERS (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 X's AI chatbot Grok, initially available only to paying subscribers,
may soon be accessible to everyone. 

 GOOGLE'S FLOOD FORECASTING AI TO REACH 700 MILLION PEOPLE (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Google's AI-based flood forecasting is expanding to over 100
countries, covering 700 million people.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 STDGEN (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 StdGen is a new method for generating 3D characters from a single
image. It decomposes the problem into separable pieces (like hair and
jackets) which improves the quality of output. 

 MIXTURE-OF-TRANSFORMERS: A SPARSE AND SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE FOR
MULTI-MODAL FOUNDATION MODELS (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture introduces a sparse
multi-modal transformer that decouples parameters by modality (text,
images, and speech), enabling efficient processing while maintaining
performance quality. Across multiple evaluations, including the
Chameleon 7B and Transfusion settings, MoT achieves comparable or
better performance than dense baselines while using significantly
fewer computational resources - as low as 37.2% of the FLOPs for
speech processing and 47.2% of the wall-clock time for image
generation. 

 PROTEIN MODELING WITH MULTIMODAL ALIGNMENT (26 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This study explores how to improve alignment between LLMs and
protein-focused geometric deep models for better cross-modal
understanding.

 CALLRAIL'S AI IS HELPING MARKETING AND SALES TEAMS CONVERT MORE LEADS
INTO CUSTOMERS. (SPONSOR) [13] 

 CallRail's Call Tracking and AI platform just gained three new AI
features that combine the power of conversational and generative AI to
track and convert leads faster.

Listen to a call [13] and see smart follow-up, action plan, and call
coaching in action.

Plus, you can try CallRail free for 14 days [14].

 ALPHAFOLD 3 (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 DeepMind has open sourced the code and weights of AlphaFold 3 for
research use. It is a substantial improvement over previous
state-of-the-art and could accelerate AI for science applications. 

 CONTINUAL LEARNING WITH ONLINE-LORA (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Online-LoRA is a new framework designed to prevent catastrophic
forgetting in online continual learning (OCL) by fine-tuning
pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) in real time without needing
rehearsal buffers. 

 MARKER DETECTION IN DIFFICULT LIGHTING (45 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 DeepArUco++ introduces a deep learning-based approach to improve
fiducial marker detection under challenging lighting conditions where
traditional methods often fail.

 CAN LLMS FOLLOW THREADS THROUGH NEAR-MILLION-SCALE HAYSTACKS? (8
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Large Language Models (LLMs) with expanded context windows enable
broader applications. New research across 17 leading LLMs reveals that
while many models can effectively handle multiple concurrent
information threads, their actual effective context limits are often
shorter than their theoretical maximum context lengths. Many models
exhibit "thread-safety" (handling multiple information threads
simultaneously without performance degradation), though accuracy tends
to decline as context windows expand toward their limits. 

 THE CASE FOR TARGETED REGULATION (13 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI advancements are rapidly improving capabilities in fields like
mathematics, coding, and science, increasing both opportunities and
risks. Controlled regulation is essential for managing potential
misuse in areas like cybersecurity and CBRN. Anthropic's Responsible
Scaling Policy calls for transparency and a careful legislative
approach that balances safety with innovation. 

 HERMES 3 (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Hermes 3, fine-tuned from Llama 3.1, excels in reasoning and
creativity. It demonstrates superior performance with models of 8B,
70B, and 405B parameters. The model unlocks new capabilities in AI
alignment and artificial consciousness.
