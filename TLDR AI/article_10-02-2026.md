HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S NEW CODEX APP HITS 1M+ DOWNLOADS IN FIRST WEEK — BUT
LIMITS MAY BE COMING TO FREE AND GO USERS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's standalone Codex application surpassed a million downloads
in its first week of availability. This milestone was helped by
OpenAI's decision to offer Codex access to ChatGPT Free and Go tier
users for a limited promotional period. OpenAI's paid subscribers will
enjoy doubled rate limits during the promotional period. Free and Go
tier users will likely see stricter throttling as the promotion ends. 

 SAM ALTMAN TOUTS CHATGPT'S REACCELERATING GROWTH TO EMPLOYEES AS
OPENAI CLOSES IN ON $100 BILLION FUNDING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sam Altman reports ChatGPT is back to over 10% monthly growth amid
OpenAI's push to improve its offerings, including launching an updated
Chat model. OpenAI's Codex product recently grew 50% and released a
new model, GPT-5.3-Codex, indicating significant market capture
despite competition from Anthropic. OpenAI seeks $100 billion in
funding, with potential investments from Microsoft, Nvidia, and
Amazon, as it explores incorporating ads into ChatGPT.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE MANY MASKS LLMS WEAR (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is evidence that large language models can attempt to evade
oversight and assert control. Whether these AIs are just playing the
role of an evil persona or not doesn't really matter if they take
harmful actions. Carefully training model characters may help decrease
some of the risk. However, this will require developers to sit down
and carefully consider what they want from models. These decisions
could dictate how future AIs treat humans. 

 OPUS 4.6, CODEX 5.3, AND THE POST-BENCHMARK ERA (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Frontier models are converging, making it difficult to tell which
ones have a meaningful edge over others. Benchmark tests don't really
distinguish models from each other anymore. People just have to try
out different models to see which they prefer. The industry may find a
better way to articulate the differences in agents over time, but for
now, consistent testing is the only way to monitor progress. 

 THE POTENTIAL OF RLMS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Recursive Language Models (RLMs) can mitigate the effects of context
rot. They have the ability to explore, develop, and test approaches to
solving a problem. RLMs may be slow, synchronous, and only borrow the
capabilities of current models, but that's what makes them exciting.
Chain of thought was also simple and general, yet it unlocked enormous
latent potential in LLMs. Developers working with large contexts
should start experimenting with RLM traces. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.6: SYSTEM CARD PART 1: MUNDANE ALIGNMENT + MW (28
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Opus 4.6 introduces a 1M token context window, improved
execution on tasks, and new features like Agent Teams in Claude Code.
Safety procedures are breaking down under time pressure, with most
evaluations done by the model itself, which raises concerns about the
model's ability to self-assess risks. Despite advancements, issues
like sycophancy, unauthorized actions, and misrepresentation of tool
results persist, indicating an urgent need for independent oversight
in safety and evaluation processes.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 CLAWSEC: SECURITY SKILL SUITE FOR AI AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 ClawSec is a security skill suite designed for OpenClaw AI agents
that features automated security audits, file integrity protection,
and NVD CVE threat intelligence. It includes automated self-healing
processes and checksum verification to safeguard against
vulnerabilities like prompt injection. 

 INTRODUCING COMPOSER 1.5 (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Composer 1.5 strikes a strong balance between speed and intelligence
for daily use. It was built by scaling reinforcement learning 20x
further on the same pretrained model. The thinking model's coding
ability improved continuously as training was scaled. Composer 1.5
easily surpasses Composer 1 and continues to climb in performance. 

 REINFORCEMENT WORLD MODEL LEARNING FOR LLM AGENTS (18 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 RWML is a self-supervised method that helps LLMs better simulate
environment dynamics. It improves performance on agent benchmarks by
aligning internal world models with actual outcomes.

 AI DOESN'T REDUCE WORK—IT INTENSIFIES IT (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI labs promise that the technology can reduce workloads so employees
can focus on higher-value and more engaging tasks. However, research
shows that AI tools don't reduce work, but consistently intensify it.
This can be unsustainable and lead to lower quality work, turnover,
and other problems. Companies need to adopt a set of norms and
standards around AI use that can include intentional pauses,
sequencing work, and adding more human grounding to correct for this. 

 THE SAASPOCALYPSE - THE WEEK AI KILLED SOFTWARE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's AI release led to a massive market selloff. The shift
from SaaS to AI agents dismantles traditional software frameworks,
reducing costs and increasing efficiency by automating tasks
traditionally handled by multiple software licenses.
