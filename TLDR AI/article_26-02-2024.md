 6 HARD LESSONS WE LEARNED ABOUT AUTOMATED TESTING FOR GENAI APPS
(SPONSOR) [5] 

 Testing LLMs is not simple. Probabilistic output makes failures hard
to identify, while running the models repeatedly tends to become very
expensive quickly.
In this blog post [5], QA Wolf engineer John Gluck covers 6 things the
team learned about building automated black-box regression tests for
genAI applications [5], including:

	* Writing deterministic tests for non-deterministic outputs
	* How to control costs (where possible)
	* Should you use AI to test AI?

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT REPORTEDLY MAKES AI SERVER GEAR TO CUT NVIDIA DEPENDENCE (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is creating its own AI server hardware to decrease its
dependency on Nvidia. 

 GOOGLE ADMITS IT LOST CONTROL OF IMAGE-GENERATING AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google has acknowledged an issue with its AI model Gemini. The model
injected inappropriate diversity into historical images, reflecting
problems with bias in training data. The flaw sparked debate around
diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. Google implied that it will
make improvements in the future but stopped short of a full apology
for failing to properly contextualize historical figures in image
generation. 

 IS OPENAI THE NEXT CHALLENGER TRYING TO TAKE ON GOOGLE SEARCH? (1
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is working on a web search to compete more directly with
Google. It is unclear if the product will be standalone or part of
ChatGPT. Competition in the search space is filling up quickly with
the addition of Copilot on Bing, newcomers like Perplexity, and
Google's Gemini Copilot. A YouTube Short featuring Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella talking about competing with Google is available in the
article.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SIMPLER RL ALGORITHMS BEAT PPO (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 REINFORCE is a simple, standard, and easily understood RL method. It
is hard to train stably when used in simulators. PPO is much more
performant and stable in general. Gemini uses REINFORCE and GPT-4 is
believed to use PPO. 

 FLOW MATCHING FOR GENERATING PROTEINS (28 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AlphaFold is used to predict the state of a protein after folding. By
adding flow matching, which is invertible, you can dramatically
improve modeling power on the entire landscape of proteins. 

 EFFICIENT LLMS WITH EXPERT-LEVEL SPARSIFICATION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Researchers have developed a new way to make LLMs more efficient and
easier to use by employing a method that focuses on 'expert-level
sparsification', which reduces model size without losing performance.
This is particularly useful for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, which are
powerful but usually too big to handle easily.

 IMPROVED HAND-OBJECT INTERACTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GeneOH Diffusion is a new technique that improves how models
understand and interact with objects using hands. This method focuses
on making these interactions more natural by correcting errors in hand
movements and relations with objects. 

 SNAP VIDEO MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Snap research has trained a video generation model that reaches the
previous state of the art (excluding Sora) while being 3x faster to
run. 

 PRODUCTION READY RL LIBRARY FROM META (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Deployed in auction bidding systems, recommendation engines, and more
at Meta, Pearls is ready for research and deployment.

 OPENCODEINTERPRETER APPROACHES GPT-4 CODE PERFORMANCE (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 A model based on CodeLlama and DeepSeek Coder was able to get 85%+ on
the HumanEval benchmark for programming by training on a synthetic
multi-turn dataset and using human feedback. 

 INTERPRETABILITY UPDATE FROM ANTHROPIC (14 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic's research scientists have been working on a method of
understanding deep neural networks that uses Circuits. These Circuits
aim to identify subparts of models that get used for certain tasks.
The research team has released a monthly update on the experiments
they attempted and the results. 

 A NEW BENCHMARK FOR SEARCH ENGINES (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 INSTRUCTIR is a new benchmark aimed at making search engines smarter
in understanding users' intentions. Unlike current methods, which
mostly focus on the query itself, INSTRUCTIR evaluates how well search
engines can follow user instructions and adapt to various and changing
search needs.
