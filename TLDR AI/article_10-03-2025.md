HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABILITY AI SECURES INVESTMENT FOR AI-DRIVEN CONTENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Stability AI has announced a strategic partnership and investment
from WPP, aiming to integrate generative AI into advertising and media
production. 

 THE US ARMY IS USING ‘CAMOGPT' TO PURGE DEI FROM TRAINING MATERIALS
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The US Army's TRADOC is using an AI tool, CamoGPT, to identify and
remove DEIA references from training materials per an executive order
by President Trump. CamoGPT, developed by the Army's AI Integration
Center, scans documents for specific keywords and has about 4,000
users. The initiative is part of a wider government effort to
eliminate DEIA content, leveraging AI for increased efficiency in
aligning with national security objectives. 

 OPENAI'S EX-POLICY LEAD CRITICIZES THE COMPANY FOR 'REWRITING' ITS AI
SAFETY HISTORY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Former OpenAI researcher Miles Brundage criticized the company for
downplaying its cautious approach with GPT-2, which he claims aligns
with today's deployment strategy. OpenAI's recent document outlines a
continuous approach to AGI development, but Brundage warns this could
lead to dismissing valid safety concerns. Competitive pressures could
tempt OpenAI to prioritize faster releases over safety, raising
questions about long-term risks.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DERIVING MUON (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adam has been the dominant optimizer for years in deep learning.
However, recently the community has found that Muon might be a viable
alternative. It accomplishes many of the same things as muP without
requiring modifications to the model. This post describes some of the
theoretical motivations behind the optimizer. 

 OPTIMAL HYPERPARAMETER SCALING LAW IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
PRETRAINING (45 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Step Law is a unified optimal hyperparameter scaling law that
generalizes across diverse model shapes, architectures, and data
distributions. This means, using these results, one can predict how
models will likely perform before training. 

 TIME-SERIES FORECASTING (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SeqFusion is a framework that sequentially selects and fuses
pre-trained models for zero-shot forecasting. Unlike conventional
approaches, it minimizes data use to enhance privacy while maintaining
competitive accuracy on diverse temporal patterns.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SEE HOW SOURCEGRAPH'S NEW CODE REVIEW AGENT TACKLES COMPLEX CODEBASES
WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Join Sourcegraph's monthly live stream to get a live demo of their
brand new Code Review Agent (EAP) [11] - designed to make reviewing
code faster, more precise, and less tedious. The team will also demo
agentic chat, auto-edit, and other tools that help enterprises
navigate complex codebases with ease. Join on 3/13 (Thursday) to see
it all in action [12] 

 DISTRACTOR AWARE SAM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Segment Anything (SAM) is an industry-leading model for visual
analysis and segmentation. However, when there are two similar-looking
objects in a video it can get confused. This new work tackles these
“distractors” with additional memory augmentation and training. 

 AUTOREGRESSIVE STREAMING TEXT-TO-SPEECH MODEL FOR ANY LLM (GITHUB
REPO) [14] 

 A lightweight 30m parameter model that can be used to augment any
language model to enable it to understand and generate speech in
response to general purpose queries. Critically, it doesn't require
tuning of the underlying model and therefore can transfer across
models easily. 

 FEDERATED LEARNING FOR NEURAL FEEDFORWARD CONTROL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project introduces a federated learning-based approach for
neural feedforward control, allowing multi-agent systems to improve
tracking performance while preserving data privacy. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 GEMINI EMBEDDING MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Gemini team has trained and released an excellent embedding model
for text. It tops benchmarks and is reasonably priced while also
boasting excellent speed. 

 TOKEN-EFFICIENT LONG VIDEO UNDERSTANDING FOR MULTIMODAL LLMS (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Most video understanding models operate one frame at a time, which
makes temporal questions somewhat challenging. STORM, which uses Mamba
adapters, adds temporal attention operations. This post compares it
against Qwen models. 

 PENTAGON TO GIVE AI AGENTS A ROLE IN PLANNING, OPERATIONS (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 The US military has awarded a significant contract to Scale AI and
partners including Anduril and Microsoft to integrate AI agents into
operations for decision-making in military workflows. The Thunderforge
project aims to enhance strategic planning speed and accuracy while
maintaining human oversight. The Pentagon plans to eventually deploy
this AI system across all its combatant commands.
