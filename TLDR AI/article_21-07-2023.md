HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

MICROSOFT AND META EXPAND THEIR AI PARTNERSHIP WITH LLAMA 2 ON AZURE
AND WINDOWS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/07/18/microsoft-and-meta-expand-their-ai-partnership-with-llama-2-on-azure-and-windows/?utm_source=tldrai]

Meta and Microsoft have announced the support for Llama 2, a family of
large language models, on Azure and Windows, marking its first
commercial release. The partnership enables developers to build,
fine-tune, and deploy Llama 2-powered models on Azure while also
optimizing for local use on Windows. It aims to bolster Azure‚Äôs
model catalog, democratize AI, and reinforce Microsoft‚Äôs position as
a global supercomputing platform for AI, while also upholding
responsible AI practices through safety measures and risk mitigation. 

GOOGLE REPORTEDLY PITCHING NEW AI TOOL TO NEWSROOMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/google-reportedly-pitching-new-ai-tool-to-newsrooms/?utm_source=tldrai]

Google is testing Genesis, an AI tool designed to help journalists by
generating news articles. Despite these innovations, concerns remain
over misinformation and bias if such tools are not accurately
supervised. 

AI COMPANIES ARE COMMITTING TO SAFEGUARDS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.engadget.com/ai-companies-will-reportedly-commit-to-safeguards-at-the-white-houses-request-185646283.html?utm_source=tldrai]

Tech giants including Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI are voluntarily
committing to White House-prompted safeguards for their AI technology,
including independent testing and addressing societal risks. This
pledge will be in effect until Congress enacts official AI
regulations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DEEPMIND‚ÄôS LATEST RESEARCH (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.deepmind.com/blog/google-deepmind-research-at-icml-2023?utm_source=tldrai]

Google DeepMind researchers are presenting more than 80 new papers at
ICML this year, including demos on AlphaFold, advances in fusion
science, and new models, like PaLM-E for robotics and Phenaki for
generating video from text. 

LEARNING TO OPTIMIZE IN CONTINUOUS SPACES (6 HOUR READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00665?utm_source=tldrai]

Amortized Optimization (AO) uses learning to predict the outcome of an
optimization process. Since repeated optimization problems are often
similar, there are a number of powerful tools that can be used. This
tutorial presents an extremely thorough foundation for AO in
reinforcement learning, control, convex optimization, optimal
transport, and more. A GitHub repo is available. 

MATRIX MULTIPLICATION ONLY USING ADDITION (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01415?utm_source=tldrai]

Much of modern AI relies on large matrix multiplications. When
implemented in hardware, this means there are expensive multiply
components on the chips. If we could use cheap additions instead, we
could fit more transistors on the chip and potentially run with much
less power. This is very early research, but the algorithm presented
suggests we can use just additions for large matrix multiplications.

can use metadata and an existing query language to dramatically
improve the quality of retrieved data. 

RUST OR MOJO FOR THE FUTURE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://mojodojo.dev/blog/2023-07-17-rust-or-mojo-ai.html?utm_source=tldrai]

This blog walks through the reimplementation of a thousand lines of
C++ in an opencv function to a few lines of Mojo. They discuss the
trade offs and speed ups. Mojo still doesn't have a local release, but
it is expected to come soon. 

THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF GENERATIVE AI (34 MINUTE READ)
[https://shriftman.substack.com/p/the-building-blocks-of-generative?utm_source=tldrai]
