HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

GITHUB COPILOT X (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/?utm_source=tldrai]


New conversational interface, GPT-4 upgrade, bug fix suggestions,
documentation writing, and automatic pull requests are coming to
Copilot. These launches are the next step in GitHub‚Äôs goal to become
the developer toolkit powerhouse. 

GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT CHATBOTS ARE CITING ONE ANOTHER IN A
MISINFORMATION SHOWDOWN (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/22/23651564/google-microsoft-bard-bing-chatbots-misinformation?utm_source=tldrai]


The rushed launch of AI chatbots by big tech companies such as
Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI risks degrading the web's information
ecosystem, according to an opinion piece in The Verge. The author
cites an example of Microsoft's Bing chatbot mistakenly stating that
Google's Bard chatbot had been shut down, citing a tweet, a Hacker
News comment, and fake news as evidence. The article suggests that the
inability of AI language models to sort fact from fiction threatens to
unleash a trail of misinformation and mistrust across the web, and
that the companies' disclaimers of the bots being experiments are a
flimsy defense. 

NVIDIA ENTERS FOUNDATION MODELS AS A SERVICE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1638211601944948736.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Robots, images, text, bio and more! Nvidia has thrown their hat in the
ring. Foundation Model as a Service is set to make its debut in the
enterprise sector, offering tailored solutions for proprietary data.
With its multimodal capabilities, this platform can work with a range
of data types, including text, images, videos, and even 3D content,
allowing for customized multimodal language models and generative
models to be built to suit specific use cases. The partnership with
industry leaders like Getty Images, Shutterstock, and Adobe ensures
that copyright issues are efficiently addressed.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DATA DEDUPLICATION FOR THE REST OF US (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09540?utm_source=tldrai] 

There have been many papers arguing both sides of the debate around
the usefulness of data deduplication. It seems, in any case, that
training on the same data point 300,000+ times is wasteful. A simple
deduplication technique here is to embed your data points, cluster
into k (e.g., 10k clusters), then remove a subset that has really high
cosine similarity with other data points. This technique seems robust
to the choice of embedding and the number of clusters, as long as the
clusters are high enough. It also works across modalities. 

TEXT TO ROOM (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://lukashoel.github.io/text-to-room/?utm_source=tldrai] 

There has never been a community more interested in interior design
than the generative AI community currently is. This work fits in well
with the current trend. There are a lot of novel tweaks they needed to
do to make the entire 3D space align with the prompt. In all, very
interesting work for 3D asset generation. 

FREEDOM: A TRAINING-FREE CONDITIONAL DIFFUSION MODEL (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09833?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article presents FreeDoM, a training-free conditional diffusion
model that leverages off-the-shelf pretrained networks to construct
time-independent energy functions, enabling effective generation for
various conditions. The proposed method offers advantages in
simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost and has a broader range of
applications than existing training-free methods, as demonstrated by
experiments on diverse data domains, including image and latent code
domains.

CHATLLAMA (WEBSITE) [https://chatllama.baseten.co/?utm_source=tldrai] 

A nice wrapper interface around the instruction tuned Alpaca model.
Only the 7B model is available, with others coming. While the quality
doesn‚Äôt match ChatGPT it is a fun open alternative with linked code.


GENERATIVE MODELS FOR MEDICAL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels?utm_source=tldrai] 

A good step towards evaluation, creation, and curation of generative
models for a wide variety of tasks with a specific focus on medical.
This project aims to assist by building tools for generative medical
tasks and comes with metrics and tutorials to help you get started.

IS AI THE NEXT TECH MONOPOLY? (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/03/22/ai-might-have-already-set-the-stage-for-the-next-tech-monopoly-00088382?utm_source=tldrai]


Due to the enormous capital requirements of building some of these AI
systems, it‚Äôs not clear that they will serve to disrupt and bring
innovation in the way people hope. They are hard to replicate and
opaque, but may serve as the foundation upon which a huge number of
companies are built. 

MOZILLA LAUNCHES NEW STARTUP FOCUSED ON TRUSTWORTHY AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/mozilla-launches-a-new-startup-focused-on-trustworthy-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


Mozilla, the developers of the Firefox browser, are launching an AI
startup to build an AI that is open-source and ‚Äútrustworthy.‚Äù
Called Mozilla.ai, the newly forged company‚Äôs mission isn‚Äôt to
build just any AI ‚Äî its mission is to build AI that‚Äôs open source
and ‚Äútrustworthy,‚Äù according to Mark Surman, the executive
president of Mozilla and the head of Mozilla.ai. 

MORGAN STANELY AND OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/customer-stories/morgan-stanley?utm_source=tldrai]


Morgan Stanley is using OpenAI's GPT-4 to power an internal chatbot
that helps wealth management personnel locate relevant information.
The vast amount of information on investment strategies, market
research, and analyst insights is housed across many internal sites,
largely in PDF form, requiring advisors to scan through a great deal
of information to find answers to specific questions. The model will
perform a comprehensive search of wealth management content and
"effectively unlocks the cumulative knowledge of Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management."
