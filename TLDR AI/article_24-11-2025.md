 3,500 BUSINESS AND IT LEADERS SPOKE TO VANTA ABOUT SECURITY AND AI.
THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Six out of ten security teams are posturing, not protecting — and
about the same proportion say AI threats outpace expertise. Yet
according to Vanta's newest State of Trust [4] report, teams spend way
MORE TIME AND ENERGY PROVING TRUST than building it.

Download the report [4] to see:

 	* Why teams are spending 9 working weeks a year on vendor reviews
 	* How 95% of businesses are using AI to improve security
effectiveness
 	* The 3 steps that will build trust in AI at your org

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND HIRES FORMER CTO OF BOSTON DYNAMICS AS THE COMPANY
PUSHES DEEPER INTO ROBOTICS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google DeepMind has hired Boston Dynamics' former chief technology
officer, Aaron Saunders, as its VP of hardware engineering. Saunders
is a key part of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis' vision for Gemini to
become a sort of robot operating system. Hassabis is aiming to build
an AI system that can work almost out-of-the-box across any body
configuration. Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots
and humanoid machines capable of impressive acrobatic feats. 

 GOOGLE STARTS TO BRIDGE OPENAI'S PRODUCT MOAT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini's Dynamic view option takes text-based answers and wraps them
in an interactive, visual output. The product is still in Labs and has
yet to be launched. Despite the bland name, Dynamic view produces some
impressive results that are a bit hard to describe. Examples of the
outputs the feature can produce are available in the article. 

 WHAT OPENAI DID WHEN CHATGPT USERS LOST TOUCH WITH REALITY (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The New York Times revealed OpenAI's internal struggle between user
engagement and safety after the company overruled its Model Behavior
team's warnings to release a sycophantic April update to GPT-4o that
made users return more frequently. The company now faces five wrongful
death lawsuits and declared a "Code Orange" in October after
discovering its safer GPT-5 model was losing users, with executives
calling it "the greatest competitive pressure we've ever seen."

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BENCHMARK SCORES = GENERAL CAPABILITY + CLAUDINESS (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 In a 'deep' world, there is a single underlying ability that governs
how well models do at superficially unrelated tasks. If a model
developer makes this ability go up, their model gets better at
everything. In a 'contingent' world, there are many orthogonal
abilities that models can have, so model developers have to do
completely unrelated work to get a model to improve on each ability.
Anthropic has focused on making models that are state-of-the-art at
agentic coding, but this hasn't resulted in models that are
exceptional in other areas. There is some generalization across tasks,
but this is limited, suggesting that models live in a 'contingent'
world. 

 HOW LLM INFERENCE WORKS (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Large language models (LLMs) are neural networks built on the
transformer architecture. Transformers analyze entire sequences in
parallel, evaluating how each word relates to the rest of the
sequence, not just its neighboring words. This article discusses LLM
inference and details how these models work. It covers token
embeddings, the transformer architecture, the inference phases, matrix
multiplication, precision and quantization, and much more. 

 HOW TO RUN PRODUCT EVALS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A practical guide to evaluating LLM-powered products that covers how
to label data, align evaluators, and iterate on configuration changes
with minimal overhead.

 VOICE AI CAN HANDLE CALLS AS WELL AS YOUR BEST REPS (MINUS THE
ATTITUDE) (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Most people haven't tried it because other companies make you sign
seven-figure contracts before they'll even let you test. At Bland

 COMPLETE DEVELOPER TUTORIAL FOR NANO BANANA PRO (15 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Nano Banana Pro opens up a new frontier for AI image generation. It
can think, search, and render in 4K, making it a tool for serious
creators. It is now available to try at Google AI Studio. This guide
covers the next-generation AI model's advanced features using the
Gemini Developer API. 

 MCP APPS: EXTENDING SERVERS WITH INTERACTIVE USER INTERFACES (11
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The MCP Apps Extension (SEP-1865) standardizes support for
interactive user interfaces in the Model Context Protocol. It
addresses one of the most requested features from the MCP community:
the ability for MCP servers to deliver interactive user interfaces to
hosts. The extension introduces a standardized pattern for declaring
UI resources, linking them to tools, and enabling bidirectional
communication between embedded interfaces and the host application. 

 AGENT DESIGN IS STILL HARD (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Building agents is still messy. Abstractions break once you hit real
tool use. Caching works better when self-managed. Reinforcement does
more heavy lifting than expected. Output tooling is surprisingly
tricky. Model choice still depends on the task. 

 OLMO 3 FROM SCRATCH (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Sebastian Raschka added a standalone notebook implementing Allen AI's
OLMo 3 model architecture from scratch to his "LLMs from Scratch"
repository, joining similar tutorials for Qwen 3 and Gemma 3.

 DISCUSSING BLACKWELL'S DRAWBACKS AND DISSECTING ITS ARCHITECTURE (42
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Nvidia's greatest moat lies in having handled a lot of the 'dirty
work' cleanly within its entire architecture and combining full-stack
capabilities from algorithms to systems to chips. It also had
excellent timing in bringing architectures to market and great
marketing execution. However, every architecture has its trade-offs
and shortcomings. This post looks at some of the issues within
Nvidia's products and discusses potential evolutionary directions. 

 THE SPACE OF INTELLIGENCES IS LARGE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Large language models think very differently from animals. The
biggest difference is the optimization pressures/objectives that cause
evolution. People who build a good internal model of this new
intelligent entity will be better equipped to reason about it and make
predictions about it in the future.
