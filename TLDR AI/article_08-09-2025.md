HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC PAYS $1.5 BILLION TO SETTLE AUTHOR COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A federal judge ruled in June that it was legal for Anthropic to
train on copyrighted materials but that it was illegal to acquire the
materials from pirate sites like LibGen. Anthropic has offered to
settle the class action suit from authors by offering $3,000 per work.


 ASML BECOMES MISTRAL AI'S TOP SHAREHOLDER AFTER LEADING LATEST
FUNDING ROUND (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ASML is committing 1.3 billion euros to Mistral's 1.7 billion euro
fundraise, making it set to become Mistral's top shareholder. It is
expected to get a board seat at Mistral. The funding round will make
Mistral the most valuable AU company in Europe. The cash could help
Mistral make Europe less reliant on US and Chinese AI models. 

 OPENAI EXPECTS BUSINESS TO BURN $115 BILLION THROUGH 2029 (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has raised its projected cash burn through 2029 to $115
billion, $80 billion higher than the company previously expected. It
will burn more than $8 billion this year, $1.5 billion more than it
projected earlier this year. The company plans to develop its own data
center server chips and facilities to power its technology and control
its soaring costs. Its first chip, developed in partnership with
Broadcom, will only be used internally and won't be made available to
customers.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY LANGUAGE MODELS HALLUCINATE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hallucinations persist because current evaluation methods reward wild
guessing that might occasionally be correct over admitting a lack of
knowledge. The fix is simple: calibrate rewards during training based
on certainty, penalize confidently wrong errors more, and give partial
credit when models hedge or express doubt. 

 DON'T BUILD AN AI SAFETY MOVEMENT (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Building a popular AI safety movement risks undermining existing
organic public support by making it appear coordinated rather than
grassroots. What has worked so far is authentic opposition to specific
policies and elite-focused expert advocacy. The author argues that
broad movements inevitably get captured by adjacent political causes
like labor or environmental issues, diluting safety-specific goals
while exposing credible organizations to guilt-by-association with
more extreme protesters. 

 COMPUTE SCALING WILL SLOW DOWN DUE TO INCREASING LEAD TIMES (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The era of rapid compute scaling that drove AI progress since 2020 is
over. GPUs from large cloud providers are almost entirely saturated,
and frontier labs are now racing to bring new data centers online and
reserve as much chip production as they can. Scaling, and therefore
investment, is hampered by physical reality and the years required to
build more infrastructure, meaning incremental scaling is the only
option ahead, despite headlines of massive upfront funding rounds.

 THE RACE TO BUILD A DISTRIBUTED GPU RUNTIME (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NVIDIA and AMD have been racing to solve data movement at the cluster
scale to create a software moat. Voltron Data's Theseus is the first
distributed runtime to put movement at the center of scheduling,
memory, and I/O, and then prove the payoff with benchmarking results.
It is open, composable, and already running on CUDA and ROCm. Theseus
runs across both Nvidia and AMD ecosystems for datacenter-scale
analytics and AI. 

 CLAUDE CODE FRAMEWORK WARS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Dozens of open source projects are currently testing different
recipes for how to work with AI productively. These efforts show that
AI works best when it is given structure. The frameworks are
converging on a future where AI becomes a set of teammates to be
managed. The more structure you give, the more you get back. 

 QWEN3-MAX-PREVIEW ANNOUNCED (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Alibaba has introduced Qwen3-Max-Preview, a 1 trillion-parameter
model now accessible via Qwen Chat and Alibaba Cloud. Early benchmarks
highlight improvements in instruction following, dialogue, and agentic
task performance. 

 THE AGENTIC SYSTEMS SERIES (BOOK) [16] 

 The Agentic Systems Series is a complete guide for building AI coding
assistants that actually work in production. It covers everything from
fundamental concepts to implementing enterprise-ready collaborative
systems. The series provides deep analysis of real production systems,
including Amp, Claude Code, and open-source implementations like
anon-kode. It is assumed readers are familiar with system design
concepts and have a basic understanding of AI/LLM integration and
experience with either TypeScript/Node.js or similar backend
technologies.

approaches, and think about the future of conversion to prepare for
the next few years. 

 THE SUMMER OF VIBE CODING IS OVER (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Companies like Anysphere face soaring LLM inference costs, forcing
price hikes and prompting exit strategies like reverse acqui-hires.
The coding AI market's rapid growth, driven by reasoning models, is
now pressured by expensive compute costs, leading vendors to adopt
usage-based pricing.
