 CHALKBOARDS AND WHAT THEY CAN TEACH US ABOUT GENERATIVE AI (11 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This article reflects on using generative AI as a teaching tool,
arguing the technology should be analyzed beyond its technical
aspects, with consideration for its alignment with educational values.
The author, while open to using AI, is cautious about its impact and
emphasizes the need to articulate why certain tools are implemented in
the classroom. The discussion draws parallels between traditional
tools like chalkboards and AI, considering both for their cultural
significance and pedagogical implications. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF SAAS PRICING IN THE AI ERA (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The traditional seat-based pricing model in SaaS is becoming obsolete
with AI's capability to automate tasks. Companies are increasingly
adopting work-based or outcome-based pricing models, which charge
based on the amount of work AI performs or the outcomes achieved.
While incumbents are still relying on seat-based pricing, startups are
leveraging new models for competitive advantage and to reflect AI's
value more accurately.
