You‚Äôre not you when your stomach isn‚Äôt happy. Aches, bloating,
constipation‚Ä¶ you know how it goes.
Is this just an unavoidable part of life? Scientists now believe it
doesn‚Äôt have to be.

The medical community is excited about Akkermansia
[https://pendulumlife.com/products/pendulum-akkermansia?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=tldr&utm_content=newsletter&utm_campaign=Acquisition-8]
- bacterium found naturally in the gut, which can now be produced via
high-resolution DNA sequencing. Taken as a daily probiotic

X‚ÄôS PRIVACY POLICY CONFIRMS IT WILL USE PUBLIC DATA TO TRAIN AI
MODELS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/xs-privacy-policy-confirms-it-will-use-public-data-to-train-ai-models/?utm_source=tldrai]

X has updated its privacy policy to collect biometric, job, and
education data from users. Notably, X will use this data and other
public info to train its AI models. Alex Ivanovs suggests Elon Musk
might leverage X's data for his AI venture, xAI. Musk clarifies only
public data will be used.

ROBUST FINE-TUNING OF ZERO SHOT MODELS (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01903?utm_source=tldrai]

Zero shot models are AI models that have robust performance on a broad
range of distributions. However, if you tune them on your narrow task,
they tend to lose that ability while simultaneously getting much
better at what they're trained for. This is good but could be
improved. This paper presents a method to tune such models, like CLIP
to maintain their generalizability while improving specific
performance. 

A SMARTER WAY FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS AND ROBOTS TO SEE MORE CLEARLY (14
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00526v1?utm_source=tldrai]

The authors have created a new tool called SQLdepth that helps
self-driving cars and robots understand their surroundings in great
detail. 

IMPROVING MATH SKILLS IN BIG LANGUAGE MODELS (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This research looks into how well LLMs can solve math problems and how
different factors affect their abilities. They‚Äôve found that a
method called Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) helps these models
get better at math, especially when we use samples from several
models.

BATCH LORAS ON THE SAME GPU (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/sabetAI/BLoRA?utm_source=tldrai]

LoRAs are small parameter adapters that change the behavior of the
underlying model by plugging into certain layers. You can batch
generation for the base model to improve performance. Additionally,
you can batch LoRA-modified versions of the model and serve models
with different performance to different users. 

MAKING AI BOTS BETTER AT REAL-LIFE CONVERSATIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/alexa/Topical-Chat?utm_source=tldrai]

Many AI chatbots struggle with having natural wide-ranging chats like
humans do, so this project introduced 'Topical-Chat', a new dataset
from human conversations on 8 big topics, to teach AI how to talk more
like us without fixed roles.

BAN OR EMBRACE? COLLEGES WRESTLE WITH AI-GENERATED ADMISSIONS ESSAYS
(7 MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/U9kBK?utm_source=tldrai]

Colleges grapple with the rise of AI-generated admissions essays. With
chatbots like ChatGPT able to produce college essays, officials fear a
potential for generic or plagiarized content. While some schools
discourage AI use, Georgia Tech advises students to use it responsibly
for brainstorming and refining, but not for direct content creation. 

ALL 50 STATES CALL ON CONGRESS TO ADDRESS AI-GENERATED CSAM (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860412/ai-attorneys-general-50-states-congress-csam?utm_source=tldrai]

US attorneys general from all 50 states urge Congress to create a
commission investigating AI's role in child exploitation. They're
concerned about AI being used to generate child sexual abuse material
(CSAM) and deepfakes. Led by South Carolina's Attorney General Alan
Wilson, the push aims to expand CSAM restrictions to cover
AI-generated content.
