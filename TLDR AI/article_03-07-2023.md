EUROPEAN COMPANIES SLAM THE EU‚ÄôS AI ACT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779611/eu-ai-act-open-letter-artificial-intelligence-regulation-renault-siemens?utm_source=tldrai]

Some of the biggest companies in Europe have taken collective action
to criticize the European Union‚Äôs recently approved artificial
intelligence regulations, claiming that the Artificial Intelligence
Act is ineffective and could negatively impact competition. 

$650M FOR CASETEXT & $1.3B FOR MOSAICML + MASSIVE NEW AI FUNDING
ROUNDS MEAN GREAT WEEK FOR GENERATIVE AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.newcomer.co/p/650-million-for-casetext-and-13-billion?utm_source=tldrai]

Shared more for the insightful take on Casetext, the overnight success
that took a decade to build, this article gives some perspective on
how transformative AI can be and how when the opportunity arises, you
have to seize it.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

1 MILLION TOKENS IN CONTEXT HELPS DNA TASKS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-06-29-hyena-dna?utm_source=tldrai]

State space models have made a splash recently. They arose as a
potentially useful model alternative by sidestepping some challenging
aspects of the Transformer while maintaining performance. In this
work, the Hyena model is applied to DNA sequence modeling and improves
in 23 tasks. 

A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO TRAIN A CLIP MODEL (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15658v1?utm_source=tldrai]

CLIPA-v2 improves the efficiency of image-text matching models like
CLIP by using shorter sequences, achieving a zero-shot ImageNet
accuracy of 81.1% for just $10,000. 

MULTIVIEW DIFFUSION (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://mvdiffusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

This work allows you to take a single image and a pre-trained
generative model to produce a panorama or multiple views of the image.

GPT-MIGRATE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/0xpayne/gpt-migrate?utm_source=tldrai]

GPT-Migrate enables you to easily migrate your codebase from one
framework or language to another. 

A NEW METHOD FOR BETTER MEDICAL IMAGING WITH LIMITED DATA (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/openmedlab/mis-fm?utm_source=tldrai]

This study introduces 'Volume Fusion' (VF), a new way to train 3D
medical imaging models without needing large amounts of pre-labelled
data. The research showed that VF, combined with a new network
structure, improved the accuracy of medical image interpretation for
different body parts. 

FILTERED GUIDED DIFFUSION: EFFICIENT IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jaclyngu/filteredguideddiffusion?utm_source=tldrai]

This research presents a method called Filtered Guided Diffusion (FGD)
that enhances Image-to-Image (I2I) translation without requiring extra
training or changes to the underlying model. FGD adjusts the diffusion
process based on previous steps and offers significant improvements in
structural guidance and performance.

LLM TRAINING PUZZLES (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/srush/LLM-Training-Puzzles?utm_source=tldrai]

While we are all waiting for our 22k H100s to be delivered, we should
probably practice training large models. Sasha Rush has another set of
puzzles, but instead of GPUs or tensor shapes, he walks us through
model parallelism, gradient accumulation, and more! 

THE RISE OF THE AI ENGINEER (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer?utm_source=tldrai]

The article discusses the rise of AI engineering as a specialized
field and the skills required to thrive in this domain, highlighting
the need for a strong understanding of machine learning algorithms,
data manipulation, and programming languages, as well as the ability
to bridge the gap between research and implementation in order to
create practical AI solutions. 

WHICH MODELS COMPLY WITH EU PRIVACY? (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/15/eu-ai-act.html?utm_source=tldrai]

It is well known that Europe has stronger privacy requirements for
many digital applications. This includes AI and language models.
Unfortunately, many of the model providers today don't fully comply
with these privacy requirements. This post explores where they fall
short and which ones are the closest to full compliance.

COULD A NEW RELIGION DEVELOP AROUND AI? (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://thewalrus.ca/ai-religion/?utm_source=tldrai]

The Walrus examines the rise of AI religion and explores the concept
of artificial general intelligence (AGI) as a potential deity. It
discusses the beliefs and practices of those who see AGI as a
religious force, the ethical implications of AI worship, and the
motivations behind this emerging phenomenon, highlighting the role of
technology in shaping our spiritual experiences and challenging
traditional notions of religion.
