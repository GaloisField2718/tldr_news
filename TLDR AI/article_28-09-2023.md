secret. Researchers have introduced RankVicuna, an open-source tool
that can reorder search results using language models. 

MAKING LLMS FASTER AND SMALLER WITH QA-LORA (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14717v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Large language models are powerful, but often too big for some devices
due to their computational demands. This new method, QA-LoRA, makes
models more efficient by cleverly changing how they're built and
fine-tuned.
