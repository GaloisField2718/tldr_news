Your AI app needs data from other APIs. How do you get it?
Most developers slog through a spaghetti of scripts and a dozen
documentation pages to build a pipeline that breaks two weeks later.

What if you could build complex automations
[https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain]
10x faster, without fighting APIs?

The new integration between n8n
[https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain%5C]
and Langchain lets you build smart, context-aware LLM apps
[https://n8n.io/langchain/?utm_source=paid&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tldr-newslertter-langchain]
and integrate them with workflows.

Trigger your apps with precise, refined data. Use the outputs for
enhanced automated actions. It‚Äôs super easy, even if you‚Äôre not
super technical.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

REKA LAUNCHES THEIR FLAGSHIP MULTIMODAL MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://reka.ai/announcing-our-multimodal-ai-assistant/?utm_source=tldrai]

Yasa-1 is an audio, video, and text model from the creators of the
extremely popular T5 language model. It boasts impressive performance
across a number of tasks. Yasa-1 is currently in private preview. 

LINKEDIN GOES BIG ON NEW AI TOOLS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/linkedin-goes-big-on-new-ai-tools-for-learning-recruitment-marketing-and-sales-powered-by-openai/?utm_source=tldrai]

LinkedIn is launching a series of AI-based features to enhance its job
hunting, marketing, and sales offerings. These include an improved
version of its Recruiter talent sourcing platform with integrated AI,
an AI-driven LinkedIn Learning coach, and a new AI tool for marketing
campaigns. 

GENERATIVE AI JOBS WILL CONTINUE TO CLUSTER IN THE SAME BIG TECH HUBS
(9 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-shows-that-without-intervention-generative-ai-jobs-will-continue-to-cluster-in-the-same-big-tech-hubs/?utm_source=tldrai]

Despite open-source AI democratization, over 60% of generative AI job
postings from July 2022-2023 were in 10 major tech hubs. Interventions
and expanded research programs are needed to diversify AI's geographic
footprint.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

GENERALIST ROBOT POLICY (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

A robot's policy is the guiding algorithm that determines how it acts.
Typically these are robot and task specific. This makes it hard for
robotics to adapt. This new work from Google shows a single (55B
parameter) policy that can perform 160k+ different tasks. 

MAKING MULTI-MODAL LLMS WORK FOR DIFFERENT TASKS (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00582v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Multi-modal Large Language Models excel in many tasks but often
struggle to pinpoint specific objects in images. Researchers have
developed a way to improve this by turning object locations into text
and training the model with special tasks. 

EFFICIENT LARGE-SCALE 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00874?utm_source=tldrai]

Rebuilding large 3D scenes, especially when some data is missing, is
crucial for self-driving cars. This new method, PC-NeRF, combines two
modules to optimize the reconstruction at multiple levels, ensuring
detailed 3D models even with incomplete data.

BETTER IMAGE RESTORATION WITH VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://algolzw.github.io/daclip-uir/?utm_source=tldrai]

Vision-language models like CLIP work well for many tasks but struggle
with image restoration. This project introduces DA-CLIP, a model that
adjusts how CLIP works to handle these tasks better, leading to
clearer image reconstructions. 

ONNXSTREAM (GITHUB REPO)

A program that enables you to run Stable Diffusion 1.5 on a Raspberry
Pi Zero 2.

LARGE WORLD MODELS FOR SELF DRIVING (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/?utm_source=tldrai]

Most self driving systems have been large combinations of rules-based,
expert systems, and learned modules. This work by Wayve shows a 9B
joint video, action, and text model that performs extremely well in
diverse scenarios. 

IS DATA STILL A MOAT? (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://matt-rickard.com/is-data-still-a-moat?utm_source=tldrai]

Generative AI is reshaping the traditional value placed on vast data
collections. As large language models can be fine-tuned with minimal
data and even generate synthetic datasets, the uniqueness and
importance of proprietary data may be waning. 

AI IS GETTING BETTER AT HURRICANE FORECASTING (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/ai-is-getting-better-at-hurricane-forecasting/?utm_source=tldrai]

Hurricane Lee's path was predicted by AI-based models from Nvidia,
Huawei, and DeepMind. These AI models, which analyze patterns from
historical atmospheric data, have shown comparable or sometimes better
performance in storm tracking than conventional models, delivering
rapid results in minutes instead of hours, and might play a
significant role in official forecasts in the coming years.
