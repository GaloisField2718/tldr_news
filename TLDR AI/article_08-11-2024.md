 📋 THE AI COMPANY'S COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Are you sleeping on compliance? It could be holding you back from
moving upmarket, winning more deals, and getting an edge on the
competition.

Becoming ISO 42001 compliant [4] shows your customers that you are
taking the necessary steps to ensure responsible usage and development
of AI. Use this handy checklist [4] by Vanta as a step-by-step guide.

There's no better time to start than today. Get the checklist and get
your compliance program into gear [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL LAUNCHES MODERATION API (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral has launched batch processing and a moderation API as part of
its broader API platform. 

 PALANTIR AND ANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIP (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Palantir and Anthropic have partnered to bring the Claude suite of
models to AWS for US intelligence agencies and defense operations. 

 CHATGPT CAN NOW CONTROL A ROBOT ARM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at UC Berkeley and ETH Zurich used GPT-4 to train
affordable robot arms to clean spills. They achieved this by
integrating a multimodal agent called LangChain to convert LLM inputs
into robot actions. The research showcases a novel proof-of-concept
for human-robot interaction and democratizes robotics with open-source
technology.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MAGNETIC ONE: GENERALIST MULTI AGENT MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft has released a multi-agent system built on top of the
company's Autogen library. It uses GPT-4o as a backend model for
agentic behavior. 

 COSMO TOKENIZER (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nvidia has released state-of-the-art image and video tokenizer and
compression models. These can be used to train video generation, VLMs,
and other multimodal models. Nvidia has released the inference code, a
paper, and model weights. 

 3D INSTANCE SEGMENTATION (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SA3DIP is a new method for improving 3D instance segmentation that
integrates additional 3D priors beyond standard 2D models.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AI-POWERED JIRA AUTOMATION WITH WORKFLOW PRO (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Setting up Jira automations (e.g. for assigning tasks or escalating
issues) gets complicated. Workflow Pro [11]—built on Atlassian's
recently-announced Rovo AI—makes it simple: users describe their
automation goals in natural language, and Workflow Pro recommends the
best solution. Read more on the Appfire blog [11] 

 G SPLAT (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 G Splat is a powerful package and studio for doing Gaussian splat
research. 

 A NEW METHOD TO IMPROVE VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 RaVL is a new method that boosts the accuracy of vision-language
models by focusing on local image features rather than the entire
image, aiming to avoid misleading correlations. 

 3D SCENE SYNTHESIS (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 SCGaussian is a novel approach to 3D scene synthesis that maintains
structural consistency even with sparse input.

 A FASTER, BETTER WAY TO TRAIN GENERAL-PURPOSE ROBOTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 MIT researchers developed Heterogeneous Pretrained Transformers (HPT)
to train robots using diverse data from different domains and
modalities. This method enables easier adaptation to new tasks without
starting training from scratch, improving performance by over 20%
compared to traditional training. Inspired by LLMs, HPT combines vast
datasets to enhance robot learning capabilities across varied
environments. 

 THE RISE OF THE AGENTIC WEB (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Agentic Web is advancing AI agents with onchain functionalities,
facilitating the creation, ownership, and transaction capabilities for
these agents. Platforms like Replit, VIRTUALS.io, and Wayfinder enable
AI integration with blockchain for activities like asset management,
data retrieval, and decentralized applications. This shift supports
AI-driven automation in payments, trading, and decentralized finance
onchain. 

 THE PRESENT FUTURE: AI'S IMPACT LONG BEFORE SUPERINTELLIGENCE (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 More powerful AI models will soon surpass human intelligence,
enabling transformational advancements in work and society. Current AI
models like Claude are already impacting industries by automating
tasks, providing safety monitoring, and facilitating interactions
using multimodal inputs and outputs. Organizations must navigate
ethical considerations to ensure AI enhances rather than replaces
human capabilities.
