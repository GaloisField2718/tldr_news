 HOW AI IS CHANGING SEARCH, FROM BACK-END TO FRONT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The early days of search were heavily keyword-based. Later, ML and
NLP enabled search engines to interpret the semantics behind queries,
allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant results.

Today search is changing again [4] with the rise of AI and especially
genAI — and companies that sleep on these changes risk falling
behind.

This white paper by Algolia [4] explores how AI has transformed both
the front-end and back-end landscapes of search technology, including:

 	* The evolution of search
 	* The current state of AI-driven solutions
 	* Challenges and opportunities in this space
 	* The specific impact of AI on front-end and back-end systems

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC RESEARCHERS TRACE THE THOUGHTS OF LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Two new studies from Anthropic trace internal pathways in Claude
models, uncovering planning behaviors, shared conceptual spaces across
languages, and instances of fabricated reasoning. 

 OPENAI EXPANDS CYBERSECURITY GRANT PROGRAM (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has outlined its ongoing efforts to support AI-native
cybersecurity research. They now include microgrants and expanded
areas like model privacy and agentic security. 

 CLAUDE 3.7 SONNET USAGE TRENDS IN LABOR (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic's latest report revealed how Claude 3.7 Sonnet is used
across coding, education, and healthcare tasks. It offers new insights
into how AI augments or automates different occupations. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DIFFUSION-BASED COUNTERFACTUALS (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper introduces two methods that use diffusion models to
generate counterfactual explanations in image regression tasks,
highlighting trade-offs in sparsity and quality between pixel and
latent space approaches. 

 MIXTURE-OF-MAMBA (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mixture-of-Mamba introduces modality-aware sparsity to state-space
models (SSMs), enabling efficient multi-modal pretraining. It achieves
similar performance to Transformers with significantly lower
computational cost across text, image, and speech modalities. 

 OPEN PROBLEMS IN MECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A great paper that talks through some of the challenges and unsolved
problems facing the field when trying to understand how knowledge and
skills are represented internally in a language model.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BRIA AI, THE BELLE OF THE BALL FOR VISUAL GENERATIVE AI @NVIDIA GTC
2025! (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Over 20K attendees roamed downtown San Jose for 2025 GTC last week;
AI developers learned from Bria.ai [12] How to build predictable,
controllable, on-brand visual content at scale while respecting
artists' rights.

See a few of the key topics they covered:

 	* The Future of a Sustainable Economy Around Visual Generative AI is
Built on Licensed Data, Not Scraped (a.k.a stolen) Data. [13]
 	* Visual AI Cookbooks (GitHub projects) For Visual Generative AI
Model Customization [14]
 	* Explore All Bria APIs for Content Creation [15]

 MEASURING INTERNAL BIAS IN VISION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 A new metric that uses attention maps to quantify internal bias in
vision models. It is capable of identifying confounding features and
going beyond group-based accuracy disparities. 

 GUIDANCE-FREE TRAINING FOR IMAGE MODELS (14 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Guidance-Free Training (GFT) removes the need for Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) in visual generative models, reducing computational
cost without sacrificing performance. Unlike distillation-based
approaches, GFT trains from scratch and requires minimal modifications
to existing codebases. 

 A UNIVERSAL INTERATOMIC POTENTIAL (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 PET-MAD is a universal interatomic potential model trained on the MAD
dataset that is capable of predicting energies and forces for complex
materials modeling across the periodic table.

 FLUX INPAINTING (HUGGING FACE HUB) [20] 

 Inpainting support for the new powerful diffusion model Flux. 

 HUGGING FACE CUSTOM RERANKER TRAINING (22 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This post walks through how to fine-tune high-performing reranker
models using Sentence Transformers 4.0, outperforming many large
public rerankers with smaller, specialized versions. 

 AI PREDICTION MODEL IS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH IN WEATHER FORECASTING (5
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Aardvark Weather, developed by the University of Cambridge, offers
rapid AI-driven weather forecasting on desktop computers while needing
less data and computing power than traditional models. It surpasses
conventional systems like the U.S. GFS in accuracy across multiple
metrics and provides customizable, location-specific predictions. The
system's accessibility democratizes forecasting, making it viable even
in regions with limited infrastructure.
