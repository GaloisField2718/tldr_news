HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL LARGE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral, a French AI start-up, has announced a new model for its API
along with an Azure partnership. Mistral Large excels at multilingual
tasks, is within a few percent of GPT-4 on MMLU, and generally has
powerful performance. The startup also added a new mistral-small model
to its API. 

 SCALE AI TO SET THE PENTAGON‚ÄôS PATH FOR TESTING AND EVALUATING
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Scale AI has received a one-year contract to develop a testing and
evaluation framework for the Pentagon's large language AI models. The
company aims to bolster safe AI deployment and robustness within
military applications. The project involves creating specialized
datasets for model assessment and an iterative process to refine AI
systems for secure environments. This collaboration will help the
Department of Defense understand and responsibly deploy generative AI
technology. 

 DATOLOGYAI RAISES $11M FOR SCALABLE DATA CURATION (6 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Founded by some of the best researchers in data quality, Datology
aims to make scalable curation of datasets easier.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MOBILELLM (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has proposed a 350m parameter language model with strong
reasoning performance, even approaching Llama 7B on correctness in API
function calling tasks. The model has not been released, but the
innovation in fixed parameter models is worth exploring. 

 A NEW WAY TO TEST LLMS MATH SKILLS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ConceptMath is a new bilingual benchmark for testing LLMs‚Äô math
skills in both English and Chinese. It's unique because it breaks down
math problems into specific concepts, allowing for a more detailed
assessment of an AI's strengths and weaknesses in math. 

 PREDICTING THE IDEAL NEXT CHOICE OF THE USER WITH DREAMREC (16 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 DreamRec introduced a novel 'learning-to-generate' approach to
sequential recommendation where instead of the traditional method of
classifying user preferences from a mix of positive and negative
items, it creates an 'oracle' item that represents the ideal next
choice for the user.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AI LEADERS: GET FREE ACCESS TO THE SEMANTIC LAYER SUMMIT 2024
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 The Semantic Layer Summit is a one-day virtual event featuring the
top voices in data science and analytics [12]. This year‚Äôs talks
will cover recent Semantic Layer innovations for enterprise analytics,
BI, and genAI. If you want to network with other leaders, learn, and
get access to extra recorded content, you should register to save your
virtual seat for free [12]. 

 HUMAN MOTION GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 FlowMDM is a new model for generating long, continuous human motion
sequences from text descriptions. This first-of-its-kind
diffusion-based model uses Blended Positional Encodings for realistic
motion creation without extra denoising steps, excelling in accuracy
and realism on key datasets. 

 VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The VSP-LLM framework introduces a new approach to visual speech
recognition and translation by integrating LLMs. It efficiently
processes video inputs by deduplicating embedded visual features and
employing Low-Rank Adaptors for cost-effective training. 

 ENHANCING AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS WITH FUTURE TOKENS (GITHUB REPO) [15]


 This project introduces echo embeddings, a novel strategy that
overcomes a key limitation of autoregressive models by incorporating
future token information. This is achieved by repeating input twice,
which significantly improves performance on benchmark tasks while
being compatible with other embedding enhancement methods.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ENHANCED 3D RECONSTRUCTION IN VARIED ENVIRONMENTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 This project introduces a framework for Multi-View 3D reconstruction
that doesn't require prior knowledge of scene depth. It intelligently
selects the most relevant source frames, making it applicable to
diverse scenarios including large-scale outdoor and top-view building
environments. 

 BALANCING PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (GITHUB
REPO) [17] 

 Spiking Neural Networks is a new efficient model for autonomous
vehicles. It achieves high performance with up to 85% less energy. 

 THE SAN FRANCISCO COMPUTE COMPANY (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 San Francisco Compute Company is now offering the world's cheapest
H100 training clusters with flexible short-term rental options,
targeting customers needing intensive compute for AI model training
without long-term commitments. Its first cluster, Angel Island, is
currently online, with another, Bay Bridge, coming soon. SF Compute's
model is unprecedented as it prioritizes accessibility and
affordability for AI startups without demanding lengthy contracts.
