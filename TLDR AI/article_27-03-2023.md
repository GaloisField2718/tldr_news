DATABRICKS INTRODUCES DOLLY: DEMOCRATIZING INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING AI
WITH AFFORDABLE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Databricks introduces Dolly, an affordable large language model (LLM)
that displays impressive instruction-following capabilities similar to
ChatGPT. Dolly uses an open-source 6 billion parameter model from
EleutherAI and is fine-tuned on a small corpus of instruction training
data from Alpaca. The model's performance suggests that qualitative
gains in state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT may be more due to
focused corpuses of instruction-following training data than larger or
better-tuned base models. Dolly's technology represents an opportunity
for companies to build their own inexpensive instruction-following
models. 

CHARACTER AI'S NEW MODEL AND NEW FUNDING (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.character.ai/character-ai/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The start up that encourages you to talk with an AI chatbot has a
boost in resources with their latest round of funding. True dialogue
agents are a powerful and dangerous technology. They're hoping to
build them out safely for everyone.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

GENERATIVE RETRIEVAL RECOMMENDER SYSTEM (25 MINUTE READ)
[http://shashankrajput.github.io/Generative.pdf?utm_source=tldrai] 

Most deep recommendation systems work by embedding products and then
doing some sort of nearest neighbor retrieval. There are pros and cons
here. This new work uses a sequence to sequence model and a discrete
product embedding to recommend the next product in a sequence of
customer interactions. It improves as much as 17% over some strong
baselines. 

GENERATED TEXT IS VERY HARD TO DETECT (34 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13408?utm_source=tldrai] 

With the rise of convincing text generation systems, we as a community
are scrambling to build detectors. It turns out this may not even be
possible, given that the LLMs are trained to mimic human language.
There is some hope though by using retrieval for semantically similar
generations hosted by the model providers.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

NANOPALM (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/RobertRiachi/nanoPALM?utm_source=tldrai] 

Inspired by NanoGPT and NanoT5, we now have NanoPaLM. PaLM is the
pathways model from Google and it has some novel architectural changes
that make it interesting to study. A personal favorite is the use of
multi-query attention which reduces computational costs and allows for
much longer context lengths. 

REVERSION : DIFFUSION-BASED RELATION INVERSION FROM IMAGES (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://ziqihuangg.github.io/projects/reversion.html?utm_source=tldrai]


The authors propose a new task, Relation Inversion: Given a few
exemplar images, where a relation co-exists in every image, we aim to
find a relation prompt to capture this interaction, and apply the
relation to new entities to synthesize new scenes. 

MAGICFUSION: BOOSTING T2I GENERATION PERFORMANCE BY FUSING DIFFUSION
MODELS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://magicfusion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses a new technique called Saliency-aware Noise
Blending (SNB) that blends the predicted noises of two diffusion
models to achieve more controllable image generation. The proposed
method is training-free, and experiments show that it is highly
effective in various applications.

FORERUNNER PARTNER PREDICTS WHAT TYPES OF A.I. BUSINESSES WILL SCALE
AND SUCCEED (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/h7psl?utm_source=tldrai] 

Brian O'Malley, managing partner at Forerunner, emphasizes the
potential of AI to reshape industries, but also highlights the current
stage's uncertainties and comparisons to the buzz around Web3. To make
AI an essential part of daily life, he believes it needs to understand
nuances in intent and emotion, similar to how GPS and camera
advancements transformed mobile technology. AI should be leveraged to
serve customers, with the best AI companies being those where
customers don't even know AI is involved. Focusing on reliable and
repeatable AI experiences will help build enduring businesses,
ultimately bringing humanity back into technology-driven experiences.
