 📈 AI IS ELEVATING HR'S ROLE IN ENTERPRISE TECH STRATEGY (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 New data from Sapient Insights reveals a shift: HR isn't just
supporting tech strategy—it's driving it. HR leaders are steering
governance, ethics, and tech alignment across talent, performance, and
feedback systems—especially as AI reshapes the HR tech landscape.

This exclusive webinar [4] breaks down where HR must lead next: 
– AI's impact across core HR tech 
– How enterprise buyers are shifting 
– The new role HR plays in ethics, strategy, and spend

If you influence workforce strategy, tech decisions, or AI
adoption—don't miss this [4].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT RELEASES TWO IN-HOUSE MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft AI has launched MAI-Voice-1, a speech generation model that
can produce a minute of audio in under a second, and MAI-1-preview, a
mixture-of-experts foundation model trained on ~15,000 NVIDIA H100
GPUs. The technical capabilities of the models are unclear, but they
indicate Microsoft's intention to reduce its reliance on OpenAI's
model to power its AI offerings. 

 META PUSHES TO RELEASE NEW LLAMA MODEL BEFORE 2026 (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Meta plans to release its next version of Llama before the end of the
year. The model, internally known as Llama 4.X or Llama 4.5, will be
one of the first projects from Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta
recently restructured the unit into four groups, with teams focused on
training, research, product, and infrastructure. Meta first announced
the Llama 4 models in April. 

 GROK CODE FAST 1 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI launched a specialized coding model optimized for speed and cost
rather than general intelligence, priced at $0.20 per million input
tokens versus $18+ from competitors. The model is temporarily free
through partnerships with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other coding
platforms.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 MASS INTELLIGENCE (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over a billion people now use AI chatbots regularly. Recent releases
have given even unpaid users access to the most powerful models like
GPT-5 or nano banana. Intelligence is no longer scarce or expensive,
and will only get cheaper and more abundant, so institutions of every
size face the chaos of a billion people wielding AI that outperforms
humans at intellectual tasks 

 BUILDING YOUR OWN CLI CODING AGENT WITH PYDANTIC-AI (21 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 CLI coding agents can read code, run tests, and update codebases.
This article walks readers through how to create their own coding
agent by assembling open source tools and using specific development
standards for testing, documentation production, code reasoning, and
file system operations. While commercial tools are impressive, they're
built for general use cases. Learning how to build a coding agent can
provide insight into how systems work and the quality of available
tooling.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 THE OPEN SECRET OF AI AND SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 _1Password's new research shows that 63% of security leaders believe
their __BIGGEST INTERNAL SECURITY THREAT __is employees giving AI
access to sensitive data._ Read the research and learn how to mitigate
AI access risks. [10] 

 INTRODUCING GPT-REALTIME AND REALTIME API UPDATES FOR PRODUCTION
VOICE AGENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI's Realtime API is now generally available. It now supports MCP
servers, image inputs, and phone calling, making voice agents more
capable. The underlying model, gpt-realtime, is OpenAI's most advanced
speech-to-speech model yet, showing improvements in following complex
instructions, calling tools with precision, and producing speech that
sounds natural and expressive. The Realtime API processes and
generates audio directly through a single model and API, which reduces
latency and preserves nuance in speech, producing more natural,
expressive responses. 

 OLLM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 oLLM is a lightweight Python library for large-context LLM inference
that enables users to run models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on 100k
context using around a consumer GPU with 8GB VRAM. It doesn't use any
quantization, only fp16 precision. 

 R-ZERO: SELF-EVOLVING REASONING LLM FROM ZERO DATA (1 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Self-evolving large language models are models that can autonomously
generate, refine, and learn from their own experiences. Existing
methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast
human-curated tasks and labels. This poses a fundamental bottleneck to
advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence.
R-Zero is a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training
data from scratch. It substantially improves reasoning capability
across different backbone models.

MISCELLANEOUS

 XCODE 26 BETA 7 ADDS SUPPORT FOR CLAUDE SONNET AND CHATGPT 5 (1
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claude Sonnet 4 is now available in Xcode. It can be accessed in the
Intelligence setting panel. An existing paid Claude account is
required to use the integration. Users can now start a new
conversation with either GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, with GPT-5 set as the
default, when using ChatGPT in Xcode. 

 THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN AI (20 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TIME's third annual list of the 100 most influential people in AI
includes familiar leaders like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Jensen Huang
alongside newcomers like DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng and Pope Leo XIV.
