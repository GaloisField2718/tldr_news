HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 VEO 2 IS COMING TO YOUTUBE SHORTS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 YouTube has integrated DeepMind's Veo 2 into Dream Screen, enabling
users to generate high-quality AI video clips from text prompts. 

 ADOBE FIREFLY VIDEO MODEL (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Adobe introduces the Firefly Video Model, offering IP-friendly,
commercially safe generative AI tools for video and audio creation. 

 GOOGLE AI AND WOMEN'S CANCER RESEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has partnered with the Institute of Women's Cancers to enhance
AI-driven cancer research, focusing on improving outcomes for breast
and gynecological cancers. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MIXTURE OF EXPERTS FOR SPECULATIVE DECODING (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Jakiro enhances speculative decoding by using Mixture of Experts to
generate diverse predictions, reducing correlation among candidates
and improving inference speed. 

 BACKDOOR ATTACKS IN CLIP (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers reveal that CLIP models are highly vulnerable to
poisoning backdoor attacks, achieving nearly 100% attack success with
minimal poisoned data. They propose an efficient detection method
using local outlier detection, uncovering unintentional backdoors in
existing datasets. 

 MOBILELLM (HUGGING FACE HUB) [9] 

 Meta has released checkpoints for their small but mighty mobile
friendly language models. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LLMS WITH FEWER PARAMETERS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Researchers demonstrate that LLMs can maintain learning capacity
while reducing non-embedding parameters by up to 77%. By replacing
dense layers with optimized subnetworks, they achieve comparable
performance with significantly fewer resources. 

 BETTER REASONING WITH MASK-ENHANCED AUTOREGRESSIVE PREDICTION (GITHUB
REPO) [11] 

 MEAP integrates Masked Language Modeling into Next-Token Prediction
using a decoder-only Transformer. By masking a small fraction of input
tokens, it improves information retrieval tasks while maintaining
reasoning capabilities. 

 COMPLEX FUNCTION BENCHMARKS FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This repository contains benchmarks and tools for assessing AI models
on complex function calls. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 BILLIONAIRES TALK AUTOMATING JOBS AWAY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI is collaborating with SoftBank to automate white-collar
workflows using AI, sparking concerns about large-scale unemployment.
OpenAI also launched a new AI agent for research and the o3-mini
reasoning model, while the EU implemented a ban on risky AI systems.
Additionally, ByteDance's YuE model generates music from prompts, and
Anthropic introduces Constitutional Classifiers to enhance AI safety
measures. 

 WHY AI IS A PHILOSOPHICAL RUPTURE (41 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tobias Rees argues that generative AI challenges long-standing
human-machine distinctions, presenting new forms of intelligence that
require philosophical reconsideration. AI's ability to operate beyond
traditional comprehension models suggests its potential to transform
human cognition and self-awareness. Rees advocates for philosophical
engagement in AI development to explore and navigate this new terrain
of human-AI symbiosis. 

 EU PUTS OUT GUIDANCE ON USES OF AI THAT ARE BANNED UNDER ITS AI ACT
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The EU's AI Act compliance deadline has passed, prompting the
Commission to release guidance for developers on adhering to new AI
regulations. Breaches of prohibited use cases, such as social scoring,
could incur severe penalties. The guidelines aim to provide clarity
but are not legally binding. Formal adoption is pending translation.

QUICK LINKS

 OPENAI UPDATES MODEL SPEC (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has released an updated Model Spec document under a CC0
license, reinforcing principles of transparency, customizability, and
intellectual freedom while maintaining safety guardrails. 

 DEEP RESEARCH COMES TO GEMINI ANDROID APP (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Deep Research, Gemini's first agentic feature, is now available for
Android, enabling multi-step web research with customizable plans. 

 DEEPSEEK GETS AN 'F' IN SAFETY FROM RESEARCHERS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cisco tested DeepSeek's open-source model, DeepSeek R1, which failed
to fend off all 50 harmful behavior prompts from the HarmBench
dataset.
