HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NVIDIA UNVEILS FASTER AI CHIPS SOONER THAN EXPECTED (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Nvidia revealed its latest AI server systems at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Vera Rubin chips are set to go on
sale in the second half of this year. They are designed to handle the
enormous computing loads needed to create simulations of reality for
use in model training. Rubin delivers a 10-fold reduction in cost
compared with Blackwell chips. 

 AMD UNVEILS NEW CHIP FOR CORPORATE DATA CENTERS, TALKS UP DEMAND (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AMD's new MI440X chip is designed for use in smaller corporate data
centers. The company's new Helios system, based on the new chip, will
go on sale later this year. AMD's MI500 series of processors will
debut in 2027. Those chips will deliver up to 1,000 times the
performance of the MI300 series, which was first rolled out in 2023. 

 NVIDIA INTRODUCES ALPAMAYO (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NVIDIA launched the Alpamayo family of open AI models, datasets, and
simulators to address long-tail challenges in autonomous driving. The
models use reasoning-based vision-language-action architectures to
support safer, end-to-end AV systems that generalize to rare
scenarios.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GROSS PROFIT PER TOKEN (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta's $2 billion acquisition of Manus highlights the importance of
gross profit per token, with Manus showing 40x GP multiple. DeepSeek
and Together AI have the lowest multiples because they resell
inference, unlike Perplexity, which achieves the highest at 222x as an
application. Investors prioritize token monetization over raw volume,
as indicated by a 0.71 correlation between gross profit per token and
valuation. 

 AI CAPEX: BUILT ON OPTIONS, PRICED AS CERTAINTY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Letters of intents are real options that move markets, guide
counterparties, and shape capex decisions before obligations harden.
Options can be enough to pull forward tens of billions in irreversible
investment. If the option doesn't convert, the stranded capital
becomes a restructuring problem.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 GRPO++: TRICKS FOR MAKING RL ACTUALLY WORK (72 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the RL optimizer used to
train most open-source reasoning models. It is popular due to its
conceptual simplicity and practical efficiency. The vanilla GRPO
algorithm has subtle issues that can hinder the RL training process,
especially at scale. This post provides an overview of the work done
to solve the shortcomings of GRPO. 

 M2.1: MULTILINGUAL AND MULTI-TASK CODING WITH STRONG GENERALIZATION
(17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MiniMax-M2.1 matches or surpasses the level of global top-tier models
on multiple internal and external benchmarks. The open source model
has exceptional performance in code generation, tool usage,
instruction following, and long-range planning. This post discusses
how the model was trained and shares insights gained during the
process. 

 DEEP DELTA LEARNING (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A new approach to neural architecture, Deep Delta Learning
generalizes residual networks using a single scalar gate that
interpolates between identity, projection, and reflection. 

 TENCENT'S YOUTU-AGENT FRAMEWORK FOR AUTONOMOUS AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Tencent's Youtu-Agent offers a modular framework for building and
evaluating AI agents with open-source models. It emphasizes clean
abstractions for tools, environments, and agent logic to support
extensibility and robust deployment. 

 KERNELEVOLVE: SCALING AGENTIC KERNEL CODING FOR HETEROGENEOUS AI
ACCELERATORS AT META (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and
inference fast and efficient presents three key system challenges:
model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware
generation and architecture heterogeneity. KernelEvolve is an agentic
kernel coding framework that tackles heterogeneity at scale for DLRM.
It is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the
process of kernel generation and optimization for a recommendation
model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve is
designed to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation
models across generations of Nvidia and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI
accelerators. It significantly mitigates the programmability barrier
for new AI hardware.

 OPENAI TO BUY PINTEREST? STRATEGIC ANALYSIS (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI may acquire Pinterest, a visual search app disguised as a
social platform. ChatGPT is missing Pinterest's level of visual
efficiency because that is not a core capability of large language
models. Pinterest's ability to go from intent to product, or from
inspiration to intent to product, will be very important for OpenAI's
commerce aspirations. ChatGPT must go visual to create a successful UX
and user experience for agentic commerce. 

 GEMINI-POWERED FEATURES COMING TO GOOGLE TV (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 At CES 2026, Google previewed Gemini integrations for Google TV,
including visual, interactive topic exploration, natural language
settings control, and creative tools like Photos Remix and Veo.

 IS HALLUCINATION-FREE AI CODE POSSIBLE? (11 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 While verification methods will soon be able to pick up almost all
logical flaws in some fields, and foundational models will get better,
they may still struggle to produce 'correct' code.
