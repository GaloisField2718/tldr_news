 INTRODUCING THE FOREST FRAMEWORK: YOUR ROADMAP TO AI READINESS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Did you know 40% of AI pilots never achieve lift off? Thoughtworks'
latest whitepaper uncovers why — and reveals how the FOREST
framework can turn promising pilots into production-scale success.

The framework spans six key dimensions of AI readiness: foundational
architecture, operating models, data readiness, human-AI experiences,
strategic alignment and trusted AI governance — enabling you to
scale AI with confidence.

Discover how leading organizations are achieving measurable impact,
including boosting sales, driving down costs and increasing
efficiency.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE CODE ON THE WEB (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has launched a browser-based version of Claude Code. The
beta allows users to connect GitHub repositories and delegate multiple
tasks simultaneously across different repositories, with each session
running in isolated sandboxes. 

 THIS IS HOW MUCH ANTHROPIC AND CURSOR SPEND ON AMAZON WEB SERVICES
(30 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 It is estimated that Anthropic spent $2.66 billion on AWS through
September against $2.55 billion in estimated revenue, before
accounting for Google Cloud costs or operations. Cursor's AWS bills
doubled from $6.2 million to $12.6 million in June after Anthropic
introduced Priority Service Tiers that sharply increased caching
costs. Anthropic's costs appear to scale linearly with revenue - the
path to profitability might have to be dramatic price increases. 

 META AI'S APP DOWNLOADS AND DAILY USERS SPIKED AFTER LAUNCH OF
‘VIBES' AI VIDEO FEED (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic launched a web app for Claude Code yesterday. It is now
rolling out to Pro and Max users. Anthropic is attempting to evolve
Claude Code beyond a command-line interface tool. It hopes developers
will spin up AI coding agents in more places now that Claude Code is
on the web. Claude Code has grown 10x in users since its broader
launch in May. It now accounts for more than $500 million of
Anthropic's annual revenue.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BUBBLE, BUBBLE, TOIL, AND TROUBLE (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pro-AI-bubble arguments are remarkably weak, given the amount of
bubble talk. The recent series of circular deals done in close
succession has raised concerns. If there is a massive financial crisis
or bubble pop that affects AI, it will be mostly for mundane economic
reasons rather than the technology not making rapid progress. Such a
crisis will have, at most, modest effects on timelines. 

 CAN YOU INFINITELY LEARN WITH ONLINE RL? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Geospot Infinity is a photo-to-GPS model. It retrieves 10 candidate
coordinates for each upload and ranks them for the user. Users then
pick the closest. The model attempts to learn from interactions via
online reinforcement learning. It turned out that over 65% of users
would just click the first guess regardless of accuracy, effectively
nullifying the model's ability to learn anything. 

 BERT IS JUST A SINGLE TEXT DIFFUSION STEP (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BERT-style models are essentially just text diffusion models trained
on one masking rate. Masked language models can be repurposed into
full generative engines by interpreting variable-rate masking as a
discrete diffusion process. The standard masked language modeling
objective can be turned into a step-by-step generation procedure by
gradually corrupting text with mask tokens and training the model to
iteratively denoise at increasing mask intensities. A fine-tuned
RoBERTa can generate coherent-looking text after slightly modifying
the training objective, even without architectural changes. 

 DO AIS THINK DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES? (11 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Testing ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek across English, Chinese,
Arabic, Hindi, French, and Spanish revealed striking consistency in
liberal, secular values regardless of language. All models strongly
disagreed that sons deserve education priority over daughters, despite
many humans worldwide answering yes. AIs seem to share a mostly
cohesive, single underlying worldview across languages rather than
adapting to local cultural values.

 DEEPSEEK-OCR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 DeepSeek-OCR was created to investigate the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. It consists of
DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-Moe-A570M. DeepEncoder serves as the core
engine, while DeepSeek3B-Moe-A570M acts as a decoder. DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs and VLMs at a scale of over 200,000
pages per day. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is
within 10 times that of vision tokens, the model can achieve a
decoding precision of 97%. 

 LOLMIL: LIVING OFF THE LAND MODELS AND INFERENCE LIBRARIES (17 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Researchers built malware that uses Windows' built-in AI model to
autonomously find and exploit security vulnerabilities without
connecting to external servers. The technique only works on systems
with NPUs or GPUs since CPU inference would be prohibitively slow,
limiting deployment to CoPilot+ PCs and high-end computers until AI
hardware becomes standard. 

 OMNIVINCI ADVANCES OMNI-MODAL LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OmniVinci is a multi-modal architecture with novel techniques for
aligning and encoding image, video, audio, and text data. The
9B-parameter model outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni across perception
benchmarks while requiring just a fraction of the training tokens.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLAUDE FOR LIFE SCIENCES (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic is pushing into life sciences following OpenAI and Google
with connectors to Benchling, PubMed, BioRender, and genomics
platforms, alongside dedicated Agent Skills for tasks like single-cell
RNA sequencing quality control. The company aims to support the entire
research workflow from early discovery through regulatory compliance
and commercialization, rather than just individual tasks like code
writing or paper summarization. 

 ADOBE'S CUSTOM AI FOUNDRY FOR ENTERPRISES (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Adobe has released AI Foundry, a new service that allows enterprises
to train Firefly-based generative models on proprietary branding data.
The offering supports output across text, images, video, and 3D, and
shifts pricing to usage-based billing for greater flexibility.

 OPENEVIDENCE, THE CHATGPT FOR DOCTORS, RAISES $200M AT $6B VALUATION
(1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenEvidence raised $200 million at a $6 billion valuation three
months after raising $210 million at $3.5 billion. 

 PINTEREST HAS INTRODUCED GENAI FEED CONTROLS (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Pinterest rolled out new tools that let users adjust how much
generative AI content appears in their feed. 

 AGENTIC AI'S OODA LOOP PROBLEM (13 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 AI agents embed untrusted actors within themselves in their training,
so fixing hallucinations is insufficient because even if an AI
accurately interprets its inputs and produces corresponding output, it
can be fully corrupt. 

 SOLVING VIRTUAL MACHINE PUZZLES: HOW AI IS OPTIMIZING CLOUD COMPUTING

 LAVA is a scheduling algorithm that continuously re-predicts and
adapts to the actual lifetimes of virtual machines to optimize
resource efficiency in large cloud data centers.
