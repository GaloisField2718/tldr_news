HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

ARC BROWSER INTRODUCES AI-POWERED FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/03/arc-browsers-new-ai-powered-features-combine-openai-and-anthropics-models/?utm_source=tldrai]

The Arc browser has introduced AI-enhanced features under the name
"Arc Max". These features utilize OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Anthropic‚Äôs
models for functions such as renaming pinned tabs, summarizing link
content, and renaming downloaded files based on their content. 

THE SHAPE OF THE SHADOW OF THE THING (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-shape-of-the-shadow-of-the-thing?utm_source=tldrai]

Google's upcoming Gemini model may outshine GPT-4. As AI gains vision
and voice capabilities, its applications and potential concerns grow.
The future of AI hinges on responsible human use and decision-making. 

GOOGLE PHOTOS AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/23902248/google-photos-pixel-8-ai-magic-editor-best-take-audio-magic-eraser?utm_source=tldrai]

Google's Pixel 8 and 8 Pro offer AI-enhanced photo edits. While some
laud the technology, others voice ethical concerns that underscore the
changing landscape of photography. Google plans to flag AI-edited
images with metadata.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

SPOT AND IDENTIFY UNSEEN 3D OBJECTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://yangcaoai.github.io/publications/CoDA.html?utm_source=tldrai]

Detecting and naming new objects in 3D scenes is a tough challenge.
This project introduces CoDA, a new method that does this by smartly
guessing where these new objects might be and then matching their
features with images and texts, all in one system. 

ANTHROPIC‚ÄôS NEXT STEP TOWARDS INTERPRETABILITY (45 MINUTE READ)
[https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html?utm_source=tldrai]

Mechanistic interpretability is the process of understanding neural
networks by breaking them down into more interpretable sub-pieces.
Unfortunately, neurons tend to not be interpretable by themselves.
There are a number of deep reasons like superposition that lead to
this challenge. This work by Anthropic uses a sparse autoencoder to
generate interpretable representations from a one-layer Transformer.
It‚Äôs a big step forward in our understanding of these models. 

A NEW WAY TO UNDERSTAND EVENT CAMERAS BETTER (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02642v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Event cameras are special sensors that work differently from regular
cameras. This new method, the Group Event Transformer (GET), better
understands these cameras by looking at both the space and time
details of events.

DEEP DIVE: EVERYTHING ABOUT DISTRIBUTED TRAINING AND EFFICIENT
FINE-TUNING (39 MINUTE READ)
[https://sumanthrh.com/post/distributed-and-efficient-finetuning/?utm_source=tldrai]

There are different challenges when training language models on
multi-GPU and multi-node systems. It is also very hard to gain
experience in those cases. This blog post is extremely detailed and
dives into ZeRO, FSDP, and gotchas when training or fine-tuning models
at scale. 

DECODING SPEECH FROM BRAIN WAVES (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/brainmagick?utm_source=tldrai]

Meta Scientists have developed a new method to understand the words
and phrases people think or hear by studying their brain waves -
without needing any surgery. 

CTOC (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/yaohui-wyh/ctoc?utm_source=tldrai]

Ctoc provides a lightweight tool for analyzing codebases at the token
level.

PAUSE FOR THOUGHT: THE AI PAUSE DEBATE (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/pause-for-thought-the-ai-pause-debate?utm_source=tldrai]

A peek into the AI pause debate, considering what might happen if AI
research was simply paused for 6 months, paused and restarted at
exactly the right time, paused long enough to develop good regulation,
paused until alignment was completely solved, or not paused at all. 

CAN AI SOLVE COMPUTER SCIENCE‚ÄôS GREATEST MYSTERY? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-generative-ai-solve-computer-sciences-greatest-unsolved-problem/?utm_source=tldrai]

Computer scientists are using GPT-4 to address the longstanding P=NP
problem. A group of researchers from Microsoft and Peking University
guided GPT-4 using a Socratic Method with a series of prompts to
explore the problem, leading to insights that suggested P does not
equal NP. The method represents a new frontier in prompt engineering,
potentially making chat sessions with AI more focused and in-depth.

GOOGLE DEEPMIND CREATES AN IMAGENET OF ROBOT ACTIONS (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/google-deepmind-unites-researchers-in-bid-to-create-an-imagenet-of-robot-actions/?utm_source=tldrai]

Google‚Äôs DeepMind, in collaboration with 33 research institutes, has
developed Open X-Embodiment, a database akin to the ImageNet database
in computer vision. This database, comprising over 500 skills and
150,000 tasks from 22 robot types, aims to propel robotics research by
offering a shared resource to train more versatile robot models. 

ARTIFACT WILL LET YOU GENERATE IMAGES WITH AI FOR YOUR POSTS (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23903578/artifact-generative-ai-meta-instagram?utm_source=tldrai]

Artifact, originally an AI-driven news app by Instagram‚Äôs
co-founders, now lets users leverage AI to create cover art for their
posts. This enhancement, which crafts ‚Äúeye-catching images‚Äù based
on user-inputted keywords, further positions Artifact as a competitor
to platforms like Instagram and X.
