HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SORA 2 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI introduced Sora 2, its next-generation video generation model
with improved physical realism, finer detail, and greater control. The
update supports synchronized dialogue, sound effects, and user
interaction through a new app interface. 

 FORMER OPENAI AND DEEPMIND RESEARCHERS RAISE WHOPPING $300M SEED TO
AUTOMATE SCIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Periodic Labs emerged from stealth to build AI scientists that
conduct physical experiments autonomously in robotic labs. Founders
Ekin Dogus Cubuk (who led Google Brain's materials team that
discovered 2 million new crystals with AI) and Liam Fedus (former
OpenAI VP who helped create) aim to automate scientific discovery,
starting with superconductors, and claim that LLMs need fresh data for
physical experiments because they've exhausted the internet as a
training source. 

 META TO ACQUIRE CHIP STARTUP RIVOS TO BOOST AI EFFORTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Meta is acquiring chip startup Rivos to strengthen its AI hardware
capabilities and reduce dependence on external suppliers. The deal
gives Meta more control over custom silicon, signaling a push toward
deeper vertical integration in its AI infrastructure.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 TAKING THE BITTER LESSON SERIOUSLY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI is fundamentally advanced by scaling, but AI researchers continue
to work on algorithms, architecture, and data as if scaling laws were
yet to be discovered. More compute and more energy is the most
reliable path to advancing AI. Many labs are aiming for recursive
self-improvement, but the notion that AI will algorithmically
self-improve ad infinitum ignores scaling laws and that research is
compute-bound. This makes problems like autonomous science a better
problem for AI researchers to work on. 

 REAL AI AGENTS AND REAL WORK (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quietly and all at once, frontier AIs crossed a threshold into
economically valuable work. OpenAI tested experts against AI on
multi-hour tasks, and humans won, but barely, with AI's weakness being
formatting rather than accuracy. Claude Sonnet 4.5 reproduced an
economics paper's findings in minutes, work that would take academics
hours of tedious conversion, potentially solving academia's
replication crisis at scale. The difference between transformation and
waste lies entirely in human judgment about what's worth doing, not
merely what can be done.

 THE AI-NATIVE OPERATING MODEL: SCALING AI BEYOND EXPERIMENTS
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Leading enterprises are embedding AI at the core of their operations
to unlock flexibility, free resources, and accelerate growth. This new
model moves organizations from pilots to enterprise-wide impact,
creating real competitive advantage.

 DESIGNING AGENTIC LOOPS (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Agents can now directly exercise the code they are writing, correct
errors, dig through existing implementation details, and even run
experiments to find effective code solutions to problems. Coding
agents are brute force tools for finding solutions to coding problems.
Reducing problems to clear goals and sets of tools that can iterate
towards those goals can help coding agents brute-force their way to an
effective solution. The art of using agents well is to carefully
design the tools and loops for them to use. 

 HOW WE MADE SWE-BENCH 50X SMALLER (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Logicstar shrank SWE-Bench Verified from 240 GiB to just 5 GiB. It
can now be downloaded in under a minute, making large-scale evaluation
and trace generation on cloud machines fast and painless. The team
achieved this result by restructuring layers, trimming unnecessary
files, and compressing the results. This article gets into details
about how the smaller SWE-Bench Verified was created. 

 PRE-TRAINING UNDER INFINITE COMPUTE (33 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Compute for pretraining grows 4× annually, but web data increases
just 1.03× per year, forcing a shift toward more efficient learning
algorithms. Regularization parameters 30× higher than standard
practice prevent overfitting when models see the same data repeatedly.
Ensembling independently trained models achieves lower loss than
simply making models larger. The combination cuts data requirements by
5× to match baseline performance and directly translates to
improvements on pretraining benchmarks.

TRANSPARENCY LAW (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Large AI developers must publicly publish safety frameworks, report
critical incidents to the state, and face civil penalties for
noncompliance. Anthropic endorsed the law, but Meta and OpenAI lobbied
against it. The law establishes a public computing cluster, protects
whistleblowers, and mandates annual updates. 

 INTELLECT-2: BREAKING CENTRALIZED AI TRAINING BOTTLENECKS (10 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Prime Intellect has released INTELLECT-2, a 32B parameter model
trained via distributed reinforcement learning instead of traditional
centralized GPU clusters. This breakthrough demonstrates that advanced
AI models can be developed using a network of volunteer computing
resources spread worldwide, potentially democratizing AI development
by eliminating the need for massive co-located data centers that
currently give tech giants their competitive advantage in the race for
more powerful AI systems.
