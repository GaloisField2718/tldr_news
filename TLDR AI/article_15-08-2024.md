HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK 2 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has released its newest model, Grok 2, a frontier class model
capable of reasoning, code, and mathematics. It is collaborating with
Black Forest Labs to bring FLUX to X users. 

 PROMPT CACHING WITH CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has introduced prompt caching for its Claude models,
allowing developers to cache frequently used context, significantly
reducing costs and latency, with early users like Notion already
benefiting from faster and more efficient AI-powered features.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PRUNE AND DISTILLING LLAMA 3.1 8B INTO A 4B MODEL (21 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nvidia has released its Llama 3.1 minitron 4B model. The model scored
16% better on MMLU compared with training from scratch by using
knowledge distillation and pruning and required 40x fewer tokens. 

 CAUSAL REASONING IN LLMS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Causal Agent is an agent framework equipped with tools, memory, and
reasoning modules to handle causal problems. 

 RECTIFYING BIAS IN CLIP (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Biases in CLIP can hinder its performance in unsupervised semantic
segmentation, a task where images lack annotations. This paper
proposes a method that explicitly models and corrects these biases.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AMERICA & CHINA'S CHIP RACE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The U.S. is pursuing aggressive measures to strengthen domestic
semiconductor production through the CHIPS Act and sanctions aimed at
crippling China's tech advancement. Despite these efforts, China's
semiconductor buildout is surging with near-record imports of
manufacturing equipment and growing domestic chip production. This
intensifying race suggests a continuous geopolitical tug-of-war over
semiconductor supply chain dominance. 

 OPENAI UPDATES CHATGPT TO NEW GPT-4O MODEL BASED ON USER FEEDBACK (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI quietly released an updated GPT-4o model for ChatGPT, with
improvements based on user feedback, but not introducing a new
reasoning style. Users speculated enhanced multi-step reasoning and
image generation capabilities, although OpenAI clarified there's no
fundamental change in how the model reasons. The company also noted
that the latest ChatGPT variant may differ from the API version to
optimize developer experiences. 

 14 NEW THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH PIXEL THANKS TO AI (2 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Pixel Watch 3 leverages machine learning for automated sleep
detection and mode adjustments, and utilizes advanced motion sensing
and ML for improved running form analysis. It introduces an AI
algorithm for Loss of Pulse Detection, automatically alerting
emergency services if necessary. The watch also inherits Pixel's
AI-based call screening and holding capabilities.
