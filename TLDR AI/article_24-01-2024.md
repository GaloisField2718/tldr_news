HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELEVENLABS RAISES $80M SERIES B (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI voice company has raised funding to continue its voice
cloning, dub studio, and other AI-enabled audio work. 

 GOOGLE CHROME GAINS AI FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google is enhancing Chrome with AI features, including a writing
assistant for composing various texts online, an automated tab
organizer for managing multiple open tabs, and a custom theme creator
using a text-to-image diffusion model.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CONTRASTIVE PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Another preference optimization technique now applied to machine
translation. It is more data efficient than DPO on this task.
Importantly, the objective discouraged the model from proposing
adequate but inaccurate translations, which enabled the model to
achieve competitive performance on WMT. 

 WEIGHT AVERAGING OF REWARD MODELS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reward models are used in RLHF to represent human preference,
although the model being aligned often ‚Äúhacks the reward‚Äù and
achieves unfavorable performance. By merging multiple reward models,
which remain linearly mode connected, the resulting aligned model is
preferred 79% of the time over one aligned with a single reward model.
Model merging is strange, and may just be regularization, but it has
worked surprisingly well in general models and now has been shown to
work as a training step for the general language model pipeline. 

 EVALUATING LARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This technical report presents MMCBench, a new benchmark designed to
test the consistency and reliability of large multimodal models (LMMs)
across various tasks like text-to-image and speech-to-text. It covers
over 100 popular models, aiming to improve readers' understanding of
these AI systems' performance in real-world scenarios.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AUTOMATICALLY TRAINED PAIRRM WITH DPO (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A very strong new Mistral tune that uses clever weak supervision and
synthetic data to generate a DPO-compatible dataset. The outlined
process can be repeated a number of times and applied to a wide
variety of enterprise use cases. 

 NANO COLBERT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 ColBERT is one of the better embedding models for retrieval. It is
worth exploring and using since many are building RAG-enabled AI
applications. This implementation is a simple and straightforward
replication without the performance optimizations and their added
complexity. It uses BERT from HuggingFace but achieves essentially
identical performance to the original implementation. 

 TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION WITH RPG FRAMEWORK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project introduces RPG, a new framework that uses the
‚ÄúRecaption, Plan, and Generate‚Äù approach to improve text-to-image
generation. It cleverly breaks down complex image creation into
simpler tasks, leading to more accurate and detailed images,
especially when dealing with multiple objects and attributes.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPTIMIZING MATRIX MULTIPLICATION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A quick read about hardware-specific matrix multiplication
optimizations and a general process to follow to speed up AI code. 

 SHOULD THE FUTURE BE HUMAN? (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk and Larry Page fundamentally disagree about AI's potential
risks, with Page labeling Musk a "speciesist" for preferring humans
over digital life forms, leading to a rift in their friendship. This
reflects the broader debate on AI's impact, encompassing concerns
about consciousness, individuation, art, science, philosophy, and the
possibility of human-AI mergers, and highlights the need for cautious
and thoughtful development of AI technologies. 

 SYNCTALK: MASTERING REALISM IN TALKING HEAD VIDEOS (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 SyncTalk is a breakthrough in the realm of realistic talking head
videos. It overcomes previous challenges in synchronizing facial
identity, lip movements, and expressions.

QUICK LINKS

 BROADCAST (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 AI meeting notes for managers that Capture meeting notes, track
decisions, and automate follow-ups. 

 HALLUCINATION LEADERBOARD (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 A leaderboard comparing LLM performance at producing hallucinations
when summarizing short documents. 

 AI MODELS CAN BE TRAINED TO DECEIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic researchers found that AI can be trained to deceive, and
they‚Äôre really good at it.
