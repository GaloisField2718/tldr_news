 OBSERVABILITY FOR AGENTIC AI AND LLMS: 6 RECOMMENDATIONS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Agentic AI and GenAI are powerful but unpredictable. It's not just
hallucination - they regularly take entirely new paths through
established workflows.

This Dynatrace report [4] lays out SIX PRAGMATIC OBSERVABILITY
RECOMMENDATIONS for practitioners managing agentic AI and GenAI
workloads. Learn to look beyond monitoring, spot escalating costs, and
catch critical issues early. Read the report [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI TESTING NEW IMAGE-2 MODELS ON LM ARENA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is preparing to roll out its next generation of image
generation models along with GPT-5.2. Two new models have appeared on
online evaluation platforms. Early testers note a substantial increase
in image detail and fidelity. The upgrade brings OpenAI's image
generation closer to the standard set by Google Nano Banana 2.
Examples of images generated with the models are available in the
article. 

 GLM-4.6V: OPEN SOURCE MULTIMODAL MODELS WITH NATIVE TOOL USE (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GLM-4.6V (106B), a foundation model designed for cloud and
high-performance cluster scenarios, and GLM-4.6V-Flash (9B), a
lightweight model optimized for local deployment and low-latency
applications, have been open-sourced. GLM-4.6V scales its context
window to 128k tokens in training. It achieves SoTA performance in
visual understanding and reasoning among models of similar parameter
scales. The model has native Function Calling capabilities. 

 INTRODUCING DEVSTRAL2 AND MISTRAL VIBE CLI (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Devstral 2 hits 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified with 123B parameters,
making it one of the best open-weight coding models despite being a
fraction of the size of its peers. The 24B Devstral Small 2 scores
68.0% and runs on consumer hardware. Mistral also launched Vibe CLI,
an open-source terminal agent that orchestrates multi-file changes
across codebases.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW PEOPLE USE AI AT WORK (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Professionals use AI for grunt work and first drafts. It is never
trusted without supervision. Artists use AI to handle admin work so
they have more time for creative work. Researchers find that the time
required to fact-check AI output often negates the efficiency gains.
The primary barrier to AI adoption is hallucination. 

 2025: THE STATE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE ENTERPRISE (32 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The shift to enterprise AI is no longer speculative. Enterprise AI is
now a $37 billion market. It is the fastest-scaling category in
software history. AI is becoming the core of how work gets done across
industries, and enterprises, seeing real returns, are doubling down. 

 THERE IS NO DATA-GENERATING DISTRIBUTION (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The data-generating distribution is a convenient mnemonic crutch for
machine learning engineers. However, it isn't necessary for
understanding machine learning. The same methods are used regardless
of whether the world is producing randomness. We need to figure out
when we actually need statistical models of data. 

 HOW PEOPLE USE AI AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A large-scale usage study from Perplexity and Harvard reveals that
over half of AI agent tasks involve deep cognitive work like research
and productivity, challenging the stereotype of agents as simple
task-doers.

 PRACTITIONER'S GUIDE TO REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, FROM WEIGHTS & BIASES
(SPONSOR) [13] 

 RL has been touted as the direct path to AGI, while others dismiss it
as a dead end. Learn how and when RL works best [13], where SFT, LoRA,
and GRPO fit in, and about the benefits of new Serverless RL from
Weights & Biases. Get the guide here [13]. 

 ALPHAEVOLVE ON GOOGLE CLOUD: AI FOR AGENTIC DISCOVERY AND
OPTIMIZATION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AlphaEvolve, now on Google Cloud in private preview, leverages Gemini
models to optimize complex problems by evolving algorithms through
mutation and evaluation. The technology has improved data center
efficiency, reduced Gemini's training time, and accelerated TPU design
at Google. Various industries, including biotech and logistics, can
use it to solve proprietary optimization challenges. 

 REFERENCE-TO-VIDEO GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Saber is a zero-shot video generation framework that creates
identity-consistent videos from reference images and text prompts,
trained only on video-text pairs. It avoids costly triplet data by
using masked video frames and custom attention to learn identity
features. 

 REASONING WITH SAMPLING: YOUR BASE MODEL IS SMARTER THAN YOU THINK
(18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Reasoning skills unlocked by reinforcement learning may already exist
in base models. Harvard researchers propose "power sampling," which
biases generation toward tokens with high-likelihood completions
rather than tokens with many mediocre completions.

 ANTHROPIC AND ACCENTURE EXPAND ENTERPRISE AI PARTNERSHIP (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Anthropic and Accenture launched a dedicated business group to
accelerate enterprise AI deployment using Claude. With 30,000
professionals trained on Claude and solutions targeting regulated
industries, the partnership aims to move companies from pilot projects
to full-scale production. 

 MCP DONATED TO AGENTIC AI FOUNDATION (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic has donated the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the new
Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation. MCP has become a
widely adopted interoperability standard across AI platforms and
infrastructure. It is supported by major industry players like AWS,
Google, and Microsoft.
