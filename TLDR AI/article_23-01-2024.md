HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABILITY AI UNVEILS SMALLER, MORE EFFICIENT 1.6B LANGUAGE MODEL (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stability AI's latest release, Stable LM 2 1.6B, is a compact yet
powerful language model that supports seven languages. It is designed
to outperform other models under 2 billion parameters, including its
own previous 3B model. With its smaller size, it aims to lower
barriers for developers, offering various versions including a unique
"half-cooked" model for more customization flexibility. 

 TESLA FINALLY RELEASES FSD V12 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has started rolling out its Full Self-Driving Beta v12 update,
which shifts vehicle control from explicit C++ code to an AI-powered
single neural network. The release marks a significant move towards
fulfilling the company's self-driving ambitions, although the software
is still labeled as beta. Skepticism will remain until tangible
improvements in autonomous driving capabilities are observed as the
software is rolled out to cautious select beta testers.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPDIVE: LORA FROM SCRATCH (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LoRAs are Low Rank Adapters that allow you to fine-tune only a small
amount of parameters in a language model. They can dramatically
improve and alter the performance of these models. 

 GROUPANYTHING (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Grouping in 3D is a challenging and ambiguous task because you
don‚Äôt know what granularity you‚Äôll need for the grouping operation
(e.g., keys on a keyboard vs the entire keyboard itself). This work
uses multi-level masks and makes great progress on the problem of
semantic 3D grouping. 

 FACE MIXER DIFFUSION (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This work shows how you can use diffusion to clone faces in images.
There are many ways to do this with deep fakes, but diffusion is
interesting due to its ability to inpaint other pieces of the image as
needed.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ‚è©¬†FAST TRACKING RAG MODEL EVALUATION WITH SYNTHETIC DATA (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) might be catching all the AI
buzz, but how do you know that your RAG system is actually working?

Join Gretel's CPO and AI research team and Microsoft's AI Platform
Architect for this free virtual workshop [10] to learn how you can use
Gretel‚Äôs Tabular LLM [10] to create diverse synthetic datasets for
RAG evaluation.

 SELF-IMPROVING AI THROUGH UNIQUE DATA SELECTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DiverseEvol is a new method that lets an AI model choose its own
training data to get better without needing help from people or other
advanced AI systems. 

 SELF-REWARDING LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project explores Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the model
acts as its own judge to improve training. By using this method,
researchers were able to enhance a model's performance, surpassing
other systems like GPT-4. 

 DEPTH ANYTHING FOR DEPTH ESTIMATION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Depth Anything is a new approach to monocular depth estimation that
relies on a large-scale dataset of about 62 million images to improve
its accuracy. By using data augmentation and auxiliary supervision
from pre-trained encoders, this model achieves impressive
generalization capabilities and sets new standards in depth
estimation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MY AI TIMELINES HAVE SPED UP (AGAIN) (13 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This author revised their AI timeline predictions based on
advancements in scaling up models. They are now estimating a 10%
chance of achieving Artificial General Intelligence by 2028 and a 50%
chance by 2045. These changes are attributed to the effectiveness of
large language models and the realization that many intelligent
capabilities may emerge at scale. 

 INTERACTIVE CONTROL IN TEXT GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers introduce the "Prompt Highlighter," a method that
revolutionizes text generation in multi-modal language models by
allowing users to highlight parts of prompts.

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS NADELLA WANTS STABILITY AT OPENAI, NOT CONTROL (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is content with the current state of
Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, focusing on stability rather than
control amid regulatory reviews in the EU and UK. He emphasizes
Microsoft's independent AI developments alongside their significant
investment in OpenAI. 

 IMAGE-TEXT DATA GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 MM-Interleaved is a new generative model that excels in processing
and creating interleaved image-text data.
