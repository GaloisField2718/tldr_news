FIFA DEBUTS AI-POWERED SOCCER GAME (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/125313/fifa-launches-ai-powered-world-cup-soccer-game-nft-plans-ahead?utm_source=tldrai]


FIFA today launched the open beta version of World Cup AI League, a
4v4 soccer strategy game that leverages artificial intelligence (AI)
for its characters, cosmetics, and gameplay elements. 

CLEARVIEW AI GAVE 30 BILLION FACEBOOK IMAGES TO THE POLICE (4 MINUTE
READ) [https://archive.ph/s5QX4?utm_source=tldrai] 

Clearview AI built it‚Äôs facial recognition database using 30 billion
images from Facebook. Because this database has been used by the
police nearly a million times now, Clearview is now being accused of
putting people in a perpetual police line-up. 

AI DOESN‚ÄôT HALLUCINATE, IT MAKES THINGS UP (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-03/chatgpt-bing-and-bard-don-t-hallucinate-they-fabricate?utm_source=tldrai]


A quick read about the ‚Äúhallucination problem‚Äù in LLMs where they
produce outputs that aren‚Äôt factual or are potentially ungrounded.
The community has used the word HALLUCINATION which is a weird
anthropomorphism but does communicate the idea. The argument against
that word is simply that, they don‚Äôt hallucinate, they fabricate.
These models make stuff up all the time, and sometimes the stuff they
make up is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù according to a hard to measure definition of
wrong.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

VIDEOMAE V2: SCALING VIDEO MASKED AUTOENCODERS WITH DUAL MASKING (15
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16727?utm_source=tldrai] 

VideoMAE pioneers a scalable and versatile self-supervised
pre-training approach for constructing video foundation models using a
dual masking strategy and progressive training paradigm. Achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, VideoMAE proves its
efficacy as a general video representation learner for a wide range of
downstream tasks. 

LANGUAGE MODELS CAN CRITIQUE THEMSELVES? (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html?utm_source=tldrai]


In the spirit of solutions being easier to evaluate than generate,
language models at scale possess the amazing ability to properly
critique their output according to some questions proposed. Doing this
recursively and by generating their own questions, language models can
increase the quality of their generations dramatically. 

LANGUAGE MODELS ARE THE PUPPET MASTERS (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580?utm_source=tldrai] 

People are exploring how language models can use tools - Hugging Face
has thousands of AI models hosted on their website, what if each of
those was a potential tool? It turns out, you can use ChatGPT as the
controller and each Hugging Face model as a specialized tool. Do you
want to do a visual question answering task followed by summarization?
This work is a first step towards potentially automating that task.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

INCEPTIONNEXT: WHEN INCEPTION MEETS CONVNEXT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext?utm_source=tldrai] 

InceptionNeXt introduces a novel approach to enhance
large-kernel-based CNN models' efficiency while maintaining
performance by decomposing large-kernel depthwise convolutions into
four parallel branches along the channel dimension. This innovative
method results in higher training throughputs and improved top-1
accuracy, offering a more sustainable baseline for future architecture
designs. 

AUTO-GPT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT?utm_source=tldrai] 

Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the
capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by
GPT-4, autonomously develops and manages businesses to increase net
worth. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully
autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with
AI.

This article highlights a report from Stanford University, which
reveals that AI progress in 2023 has been significant but raises
concerns about increasing corporate control over AI research and the
need for greater transparency to ensure responsible development and
deployment. 

STABLE DIFFUSION COPYRIGHT LAWSUITS COULD BE A LEGAL EARTHQUAKE FOR AI
(6 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/stable-diffusion-copyright-lawsuits-could-be-a-legal-earthquake-for-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article discusses a series of copyright lawsuits targeting the
AI-generated "Stable Diffusion" artwork, which could potentially
reshape legal precedents and have far-reaching implications for AI and
creative industries.
