 🌟AI LITERACY KIT: DRIVE AI READINESS WITH GENAI EXPERTISE ACROSS
THE ENTERPRISE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 60% of people say they don't currently have the right capabilities to
get their work done. This gap — noted in Microsoft's work trend
index report — highlights the urgent need for leaders to build AI
literacy within their teams [4] as soon as possible. Equip your
workforce with the skills [4] they need to thrive professionally and
ensure your organization is competitively positioned to lead in an
AI-driven world with this resource bundle. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 QWEN 2.5 1M CONTEXT (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Really powerful and local 1M context models from the Qwen team. They
show how the team gradually extended the context ability throughout
training. Additionally, the Qwen team has released its inference
framework built on top of vLLM which is as much as 7x faster. 

 ELEVENLABS RAISES $250M AT $3B VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ElevenLabs secured significant funding to expand its AI voice
technology platform, emphasizing new applications in entertainment,
accessibility, and virtual assistants. 

 DEEPSEEK CLAIMS ITS 'REASONING' MODEL BEATS OPENAI'S O1 ON CERTAIN
BENCHMARKS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DeepSeek's DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model matches OpenAI's o1 on
benchmarks like AIME and MATH-500. With 671 billion parameters, it
offers competitive performance at a lower cost but is subject to
Chinese regulation constraints. Available on Hugging Face, this
release comes amid U.S.-China tensions over AI tech development and
export controls.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GAUSSIAN SURFACE TRACKING AND RECONSTRUCTION (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The GSTAR method presented in this work shows an amazing way to both
reconstruct dynamic meshes and track every point in 3D. While it does
require carefully calibrated multi-view cameras, it is a great step
forward to the single view case. 

 TRAINING A SPEECH SYNTHESIZER (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Alex Nichol from OpenAI has released a great blog post showing how to
train a speech synthesizer. This method, which uses VQVAEs and
autoregressive models, is common in multimodal understanding and
generation. 

 PARAMETER-EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING FOR FOUNDATION MODELS (29 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This survey reviews parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for
foundation models, offering insights into methods that minimize
computational costs while maintaining performance across diverse
tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 REASONING ON LLAMA (GITHUB GIST) [11] 

 This is the current minimal working replication of the reasoning
models presented originally by OpenAI and published by DeepSeek. It
uses format and correctness rewards across math problems. This
particular snippet also shows the “aha” moment when training for
sufficiently long. 

 1PROMPT1STORY (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 1Prompt1Story is a training-free approach for consistent
text-to-image generations with a single concatenated prompt. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH COT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project investigates the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance
autoregressive image generation.

 AI STARTUPS IN EDUCATION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google highlights emerging startups using AI to create innovative
tools for personalized learning, content generation, and student
engagement in education. 

 3D TUMOR DATASET (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AbdomenAtlas 3.0 is the first public dataset with high-quality
abdominal CTs and paired radiology reports. The database includes more
than 9,000 CT scans with radiology reports and per-voxel annotations
of liver, kidney, and pancreatic tumors. 

 THE PARADOX OF SELF-BUILDING AGENTS: TEACHING AI TO TEACH ITSELF (7
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI agents are transforming from reactive tools to proactive systems,
with potential to redefine enterprise software by collapsing
traditional software stacks. Yohei Nakajima outlines four levels of
autonomy for agents, highlighting advancements from fixed capabilities
to anticipatory self-building. Despite their promise, these agents
require safeguards to prevent misuse, with careful design and
oversight being essential to balance innovation with security.
