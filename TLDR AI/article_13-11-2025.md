DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 COMMON GROUND BETWEEN AI 2027 & AI AS NORMAL TECHNOLOGY (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Surprisingly, the authors of "AI 2027" (who predict superintelligence
within a decade) and "AI as Normal Technology" (who expect gradual
diffusion like electricity) agree on many areas. They say most
benchmarks will be saturated by 2027-2028 with AI matching expert
humans, yet systems will still regularly fail at mundane tasks like
"book me a flight to Paris" through 2029 due to long-tail errors. The
world will look basically the same in 2029, even with AGI right around
the corner. 

 HERE'S HOW MUCH OPENAI SPENDS ON INFERENCE AND ITS REVENUE SHARE WITH
MICROSOFT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI spent $5.02 billion on inference alone with Microsoft Azure in
the first half of 2025. This pattern continued through the end of
September. The company's inference costs have risen consistently over
the last 18 months. OpenAI's inference costs easily eclipse its
revenues.

 AUTOMATION COMPARED: IPAAS VS. LOW CODE VS. TASK AUTOMATION VS.
PROCESS ORCHESTRATION (SPONSOR) [10] 

 The 2025 automation landscape is confusing. Many solutions can
deliver quick wins, but also trap value in silos, create technical
debt, and block visibility. This guide [10] provides a comprehensive
comparison of leading automation technologies and platforms,
highlighting what truly matters when orchestrating complex,
cross-functional processes. Download the Camunda comparison guide.

 ALPHAPROOF PAPER (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AlphaProof reached silver medal performance in the International
Mathematical Olympiad 2024. This post shares details about how the
model works. AlphaProof demonstrates how test-time compute can be
scaled to obtain improved answers over many orders of magnitude. The
researchers developing it were entirely limited by how many TPUs they
could get their hands on. 

 BAIDU JUST DROPPED AN OPEN-SOURCE MULTIMODAL AI THAT IT CLAIMS BEATS
GPT-5 AND GEMINI (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking is a 28-billion-parameter multimodal AI
model that only activates 3 billion parameters during operation. It
has a sophisticated routing architecture that allows it to match or
exceed the performance of much larger competing systems on several
categories of tasks. The model's most distinctive feature is 'Thinking
with Images', a capability that allows the AI to dynamically zoom in
and out of images to examine details. The feature dramatically
elevates the model's ability to handle long-tail visual knowledge. The
model has been released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which
allows unrestricted commercial use.

 FEED THE BEAST: AI EATS SOFTWARE (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Software interfaces force their way of thinking on users. AI allows
you to bypass all these tools - you just have to feed it the right
data, and it can complete complex tasks. Doing this right can result
in you getting rid of almost all of your productivity tools. This
article shows readers how to get started, along with examples of how
AI can completely change a workflow.
