 JOIN GERGELY OROSZ, LAURA TECHO, AND KESHA WILLIAMS AT SONAR SUMMIT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 How can you best use AI to build better software? In 2026, this is
the question on everyone's mind. At the Sonar Summit virtual
conference [4], you'll get to hear answers from some of the most
respected voices in tech.

This event will grapple with the reality of AI writing the majority of
new code and what it means for teams, with featured speakers
including:

 	* Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer),
 	* Santiago Valdarrama, AWS AI Hero
 	* Laura Tacho (CTO at DX, co-author of the Core 4 developer
productivity framework).
 	* And many others - see the full agenda [5]!

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI'S LYRIA 3 FOR MUSIC GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google announced that the Gemini app integrated Lyria 3, its latest
music generation model, enabling users to create 30-second tracks from
text or images in beta. The update expanded Gemini's multimodal
capabilities into consumer-facing music creation. 

 WORLD LABS ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDING (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 World Labs secured $1 billion in funding from investors like AMD,
NVIDIA, and Fidelity. They aim to advance spatial intelligence with
products like MARBLE, which creates cohesive 3D worlds from images,
video, or text.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 IMPROVING DEEP AGENTS WITH HARNESS ENGINEERING (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LangChain's coding agent went from Top 30 to Top 5 on Terminal Bench
2.0 with just a harness change. This post discusses the team's
approach to harness engineering. The goal of a harness is to mold the
intelligence of a model for tasks you care about. Self-verification
and tracing help a lot. 

 PROMPT CACHING 201 (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI published a detailed guide explaining how prompt caching
reuses repeated prompt prefixes to skip prefill compute, reducing
latency and input token costs. It outlines cache mechanics, routing
considerations, KV reuse, and practical strategies for increasing
cache hit rates in production workloads. 

 ON UNIVERSE, LIFE, AND AI (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ivan Zhao frames AI as the latest “tool of life” after language,
markets, and the internet. Humanity uses culture, capital, and
computation to impose its values on an indifferent universe, and AI
extends this by accelerating idea discovery and coordination. In this
view, AI is not separate from life but a continuation of life
organizing matter and energy through intelligence.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 STOP TALKING TO WALLS OF PREDICTIVE TEXT AND START DOING REAL
RESEARCH WITH SUPERAGENT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Give it a question, and it gets to work: Subagents deeply interrogate
your topic, scour a wide range of credible sources, and package it all
up into boardroom-ready reports, slides, docs, or websites [12]. 

 INTRODUCING EVMBENCH (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 EVMbench is a benchmark that evaluates the ability of AI agents to
detect, patch, and exploit high-severity smart contract
vulnerabilities. Smart contracts routinely secure hundreds of billions
of dollars in crypto assets. As AI agents improve, it becomes
increasingly important to measure their capabilities in economically
meaningful environments. This also means using AI systems to
defensively audit and strengthen deployed contracts. 

 GLM-5 TECHNICAL REPORT (42 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GLM-5 technical report outlines the details of the model development,
combining DSA-based efficiency improvements with asynchronous
reinforcement learning to decouple generation from training. 

 GOOGLE PROPOSES RANDOM MASKING FOR LLM OPTIMIZATION (19 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Google researchers showed that randomly masking parameter updates can
outperform dense adaptive optimizers, with a masked RMSProp variant
exceeding recent state-of-the-art methods. Their proposed Magma
optimizer uses momentum-aligned gradient masking to improve
pre-training efficiency.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHARLES PORCH JOINS OPENAI AS VP OF GLOBAL CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Charles Porch, a 15-year Meta and Instagram veteran, has joined
OpenAI as Vice President of Global Creative Partnerships. Porch
previously led major cultural initiatives at Meta, including
high-profile onboardings like Pope Francis and digital strategy for
Beyoncé. In his new role, he will focus on the intersection of AI and
culture, collaborating with global creative communities to develop
products for learning, exploration, and entertainment. 

 AMICAL LAUNCHES OPEN-SOURCE, PRIVACY-FOCUSED AI DICTATION APP (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Amical has launched an open-source AI dictation app that offers
privacy-focused, on-device speech recognition using models like
Whisper. Unique features include context-aware formatting, custom
prompts, and local data storage with a cloud fallback option for less
capable devices. Available for Mac and Windows, Amical plans to expand
to mobile and integrate with broader AI ecosystems.
