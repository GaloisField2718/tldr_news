DO SMALL MODELS MEMORIZE MORE AND REASON LESS? (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/?utm_source=tldrai]

This delightful article discusses two novel concepts: integration and
coverage. These refer to two axes of capabilities in language models -
generalization and memorization. The idea posed is that both are
useful for tasks and it is hard to tell which is being used for those
tasks. Additionally, small models might be good on benchmarks because
of increased coverage at the expense of true integration.
