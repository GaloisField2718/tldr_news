 MATHEMATICIANS USE AI TO IDENTIFY EMERGING COVID-19 VARIANTS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 University of Manchester mathematicians have developed an AI tool,
CLASSIX, to rapidly identify emerging COVID-19 variants from genetic
data, potentially streamlining the tracking of viral evolution and
aiding in proactive responses like tailored vaccine development. The
method, which is computationally less demanding than traditional
phylogenetic analysis, processed 5.7 million sequences in 1-2 days on
a standard laptop, demonstrating its efficiency in managing
large-scale genomic data. The research signifies a step towards
quicker, resource-efficient identification of significant pathogen
strains. 

 TRENDS IN SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY & AI IN DRUG DISCOVERY IN 2024 (17 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 2024 is set to be a monumental year for AI in drug discovery, marking
considerable advancements in synthetic biology. This article
highlights key trends, including generative AI's influence on science
and the synthesis of modular biological components. AI's integration
with synthetic biology is accelerating the drug discovery process, as
demonstrated by Insilico Medicine's AI-powered candidate's progression
to Phase II clinical trials. 

 LLMS HAVE SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE, NOT GENERAL, AND THAT'S PLENTY (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's new AI model Claude-3 surpasses the average human IQ and
outperforms other models, including GPT-4, in advanced cognitive
tasks. Despite this achievement, Claude-3 still struggles with basic
challenges like puzzles that humans find easy. LLMs may possess a
'Special Intelligence' rather than human-like general intelligence.
They could be reflecting our knowledge back to us in innovative ways.
