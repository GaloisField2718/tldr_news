 AI IS NOW A TOP-DOWN MANDATE. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF
WORK? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI isn't just a future investment or nice-to-have feature anymore. At
many companies, it's now part of a top-down directive to increase
productivity.

Notion asked 1,000 product and engineering leaders [4] how they're
integrating AI into their work. The findings reveal three major pain
points: incompatible workflows, resource constraints, and data quality
issues.

Learn what the best teams are doing right, including examples of how
OpenAI, dbt Labs, and Pinecone [4] have achieved measurable
productivity gains with integrated AI.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE OPUS 4.1 LIKELY IN INTERNAL TESTING AS ANTHROPIC PREPARES
SAFETY CHECKS (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Newly surfaced references in Anthropic's configuration files suggest
that it may be ramping up internal testing for what could become
Claude Opus 4.1. The files hint at improved reasoning or planning
capabilities. Anthropic's internal safety system is undergoing red
teaming, a process that usually precedes model deployment by at least
a week or two. A new Claude release would serve as Anthropic's answer
to the highly anticipated GPT-5 launch, which seems imminent based on
partner activity. 

 XAI LAUNCHES GROK IMAGINE FOR AI VIDEO AND IMAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The tool can create 15 second videos with audio from text prompts. In
keeping with Grok's anti-censorship positioning, Imagine includes a
“spicy mode” that allows NSFW content generation - a contrast to
other mainstream AI image tools. 

 CHATGPT NEARS 700M WEEKLY USERS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ChatGPT is approaching 700 million weekly active users, up from 500
million in March, according to OpenAI VP Nick Turley.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI WILL NOT SUDDENLY LEAD TO AN ALZHEIMER'S CURE (12 MINUTE READ) [8]


 An Open Philanthropy analyst pushes back against industry hype around
AI breakthroughs, arguing an Alzheimer's cure won't arrive in the next
10 years. While AI can accelerate specific pieces of the process,
fundamental bottlenecks persist — clinical safety data still
requires years of observation, trial participation moves slowly, and
manufacturing novel therapies like gene treatments remains
prohibitively expensive for widespread deployment. 

 THE RISE OF VERTICALIZED AI COWORKERS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI coworkers are emerging across industries, focusing on repetitive
tasks in sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics. They
integrate into existing workflows, take over specific tasks with human
oversight, and are priced based on usage or outcomes. Key areas
include document processing, voice-based interactions, content
creation, and information retrieval.

 QWEN-IMAGE: CRAFTING WITH NATIVE TEXT RENDERING (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Qwen-Image is a 20B MMDiT image foundation model that excels in
complex text rendering and precise image rendering. It can create
multi-line text layouts, paragraph-level semantics, and fine-grained
details in both alphabetic languages and logographic languages with
high fidelity. The model preserves both semantic meaning and visual
realism during editing operations. It consistently outperforms
existing models across diverse generation and editing tasks. Examples
of images generated by the model are available in the post. 

 IMPROVING LLM CALIBRATION WITH LABEL SMOOTHING (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Instruction tuning degrades confidence calibration in LLMs, making
outputs less reliable. This paper proposes label smoothing as a remedy
and introduces a memory-efficient loss kernel, showing that
calibration issues grow with vocabulary size and hidden dimensions. 

 CCHISTORY: TRACKING CLAUDE CODE SYSTEM PROMPT AND TOOL CHANGES (14
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A reverse-engineering project tracking Claude Code's system prompt
evolution reveals Anthropic's iterative approach to AI tool
development — removing emoji usage restrictions, tightening security
policies, and adding PDF reading capabilities across 67 versions. The
project bypasses anti-debugging measures to extract prompts, showing
how AI companies continuously refine their models' behavior through
detailed instruction changes rather than just model updates.
