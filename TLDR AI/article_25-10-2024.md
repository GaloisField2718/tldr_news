HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COHERE'S MULTILINGUAL MODEL'S DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT (13 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 One of the best efforts at multilingual language model training, the
Aya project has grown substantially since its launch earlier this
year. Most of the gains in performance have come from strong post
training recipes. It also processes audio input and can generate
images all from non-English input. 

 ANTHROPIC ANALYSIS TOOL (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Claude can now write and execute code as part of artifacts. 

 GRAMMY-WINNING MUSICIAN AND GOOGLE UNVEIL MUSICFX DJ (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Jacob Collier, a Grammy-winning musician, has teamed up with Google
DeepMind and Google Labs to create MusicFX DJ, an AI-powered music
tool. The interface has been redesigned to encourage creativity and
help users easily enter a "flow state" of artistic inspiration.
MusicFX DJ is available now, offering intuitive controls for all skill
levels. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OMNIPARSER (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Screenshot parsing tool for models to use digital interfaces. 

 META'S QUANTIZED SMALL MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta has quantized its 1B and 3B language models to be 2-4x faster at
minimal loss of quality while being 50%+ smaller. This was enabled by
its quantization-aware training setup, which allows for models to
adjust to the small precision. 

 FAST POINT CLOUD UPSAMPLING (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A simple yet efficient method for upsampling and cleaning point
clouds using a modified octree-based 3D U-Net (OUNet). 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SCALE AUTOMATED WEB TESTING WITHOUT SCALING HEADCOUNT (SPONSOR) [13] 

 QA Wolf (4.8 ⭐ on G2) [13] brings AI-level scale and efficiency to
testing, with unlimited parallel test runs on their cloud
infrastructure and a zero-flake guarantee.

80% automated test coverage [13] in just 4 months. Trusted by Cohere,
Autotrader, Salesloft and many others.

 EXECUTORCH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ExecuTorch enables on-device inference on mobile and edge devices
including wearables, embedded devices, and microcontrollers. It also
enables efficient deployment of PyTorch models to edge devices.
ExecuTorch is compatible with a wide variety of computing platforms
and it can fully utilize hardware capabilities such as CPUs, NPUs, and
DSPs. Step-by-step tutorials on how to use ExecuTorch are available. 

 FEDERATED TRANSFORMER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Federated Transformer (FeT) is a new framework designed to improve
the performance and privacy of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)
across multiple parties. 

 A MORE EFFICIENT VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 ADEM-VL is a new vision-language model designed to overcome hardware
limitations in existing models.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PREDICTING WEIGHT LOSS WITH MACHINE LEARNING (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This author used a simple feedforward DNN model to track and predict
weight loss on a ketogenic diet. The model captured the non-linear
weight loss pattern, fit a function to the data, and visualized
calorie metrics. The Harris-Benedict Equation was used to compare
calorie needs to real weight loss for better insights. 

 VIDEO SCRAPING: EXTRACTING JSON DATA FROM A 35 SECOND SCREEN CAPTURE
FOR LESS THAN 1/10TH OF A CENT (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google Gemini's AI Studio can successfully extract numerical data
from a video screen recording of emails. The process involves using
the inexpensive Gemini 1.5 Flash model and incurs almost no cost. This
novel "video scraping" approach offers a practical alternative to
traditional data extraction methods. 

 THE AI INVESTMENT BOOM (11 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The AI boom is driving significant US investment in data centers,
computing infrastructure, and advanced hardware, with data center
construction reaching a record-high $28.6 billion annually. This surge
is fueled by the growing demand for powerful computing resources
necessary for training and deploying advanced AI models. While revenue
rebounds in the tech sector, job growth remains concentrated in
semiconductor manufacturing and infrastructure, diverting focus from
traditional programming roles.
