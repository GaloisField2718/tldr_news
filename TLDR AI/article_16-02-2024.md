RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 AUTOMATED UNIT TEST IMPROVEMENT USING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AT META
(26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta used large language models to write tests for its code base. It
found substantial improvements in test coverage and overall code
quality. 

 META‚ÄôS V-JEPA MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta‚Äôs VP & Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun has previously said that
we need more data-efficient self-supervised models for general
intelligence. This work is one step towards that, with models trained
on video to understand aspects of the world. The models are publicly
available. 

 VIDEO COMPRESSION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [11]
