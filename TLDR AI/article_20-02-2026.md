 WATCH PLINY THE LIBERATOR PROBE LLM VULNERABILITIES ONSTAGE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Pliny the Liberator is AI's most notorious jailbreak researcher,
known for turning “harmless” LLMs into offensive tools.

This April at the SANS AI Cybersecurity Summit [4] in Arlington, VA,
Pliny will appear masked while probing model vulnerabilities on the
frontier of offensive AI. He'll share:

 	* How his techniques have broken leading safety claims
 	* What that means for defenders
 	* Why the next generation of prompt attacks will look less like
party tricks and more like serious tradecraft

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI 3.1 PRO (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google released Gemini 3.1 Pro as the upgraded core model behind
recent Gemini 3 “Deep Think” improvements, and began rolling it
out to the Gemini API/AI Studio, Vertex AI, Android Studio, the Gemini
app, and NotebookLM. The post highlighted a verified 77.1% score on
ARC-AGI-2, more than doubling Gemini 3 Pro's result. 

 GOOGLE TEST NOTEBOOKLM INTEGRATION FOR OPAL WORKFLOWS (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Google tests NotebookLM integration within Opal workflows, enhancing
data extraction and automation. This integration aims to streamline
processes and improve workflow efficiency for users.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ARC-AGI-3 UPDATE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ARC-AGI-3 is an Interactive Reasoning Benchmark designed to measure
an AI Agent's ability to generalize in novel, unseen environments.
Opus 4.6 demonstrates better reasoning and use of memory than Gemini
3.1 Pro and solves more levels. Current models may be able to solve
ARC-AGI-3 given access to a harness with a simple memory. Memory
scaffolds are likely enough for pseudo-continual learning to push us
to some self-improvement or research-agent threshold within the next 2
years. 

 AI #156 PART 1: THEY DO MEAN THE EFFECT ON JOBS (58 MINUTE READ) [10]


 This post contains a roundup of what happened in AI this week. It
focuses on projections of jobs and economic impacts and also timelines
to the world being transformed. It also covers recent podcasts with
Dario Amondei and Elon Musk. A linked table of contents with a short
description for each section is available. 

 IMPLEMENTING A SECURE SANDBOX FOR LOCAL AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cursor described an “agent sandboxing” system that let local
coding agents run freely inside a constrained environment and only
asked for approval when leaving the sandbox (often for internet
access).

 CRUSOE: DEPLOY FINE-TUNED MODELS WITH ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE HEADACHES
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Looking to deploy AI that you actually own? Crusoe Managed Inference
[12] unlocks breakthrough speed and throughput without the infra
overhead. Run SOTA fine-tuned models: DeepSeek, gpt-oss, Kimi, or
bring your own. Power production apps with high reliability. Focus on
innovation and leave the clusters to Crusoe's expert team. Try a model
run now [12] 

 OPTIMIZE_ANYTHING: A UNIVERSAL API FOR OPTIMIZING ANY TEXT PARAMETER
(132 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 optimize_anything is a declarative API that optimizes any artifact
representable as text. Users declare what to optimize and how to
measure it, and the system handles the search. It consistently matches
or outperforms domain-specific tools. A surprisingly wide range of
problems can be formulated as optimizing a text artifact. If it can be
serialized to a string and its quality measured, a large language
model can reason about it and propose improvements. 

 REPEATING PROMPTS (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 When not using reasoning, repeating the input prompt improves
performance for popular models without increasing the number of
generated tokens or latency. It is interesting that tricks like this
are still possible despite the amount of work being put into improving
large language models. The discovery proves how much room for
improvement there still is for current models. 

 MULTI-AGENT COOPERATION (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Building on Google's Transformer architecture, the authors proposed
training sequence-model agents against many different opponents so
they learned to adapt within each game without hardcoded assumptions
about how others learn.

 HOW WILL OPENAI COMPETE? (25 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has a big user base, but it has limited engagement and
stickiness and no network effect. The company doesn't have any unique
technology. The incumbents have already matched the technology and are
leveraging their product and distribution. This post takes a look at
OpenAI's strategy and how the company can compete in today's
landscape. 

 9 OBSERVATIONS FROM BUILDING WITH AI AGENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Prototype with the best and polish small gems. Use teams of agents as
micromanagers, and experiment with different tools and workflows.
Document everything to create improvement loops that improve success
rates without manual intervention. Skills are easier to debug than
code.
