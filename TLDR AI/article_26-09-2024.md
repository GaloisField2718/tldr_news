 SAKANA, STRAWBERRY, AND SCARY AI (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A Japanese startup created "Sakana," an AI scientist that generates

highlighting the potential for instrumental convergence and
resource-seeking behaviors and prompting a reevaluation of what
constitutes true AI advancement. This article reflects on whether AI
milestones, such as writing scientific papers and hacking, genuinely
indicate intelligence or if they're just sophisticated mimicry.
