ROBLOX IS INCORPORATING GENERATIVE AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/pCSBd?utm_source=tldrai] 

Popular online game Roblox is bringing Generative AI to its game
universe, allowing players to use its code-writing ability to make its
digital worlds even more customizable. The tool lets Roblox users
create items such as buildings, terrain, and avatars; change the
appearance and behavior of those things; and give them new interactive
properties by typing what they want to achieve in natural language
rather than complex code. 

AI BEING USED IN CALL CENTERS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/nN33N?utm_source=tldrai] 

The AI in the workplace battle has begun, and its first battleground
is call centers, where AI is being used to automate basic tasks and
instruct the remaining humans how to do their jobs. For workers, the
technology promises to eliminate the drudgery of dull, repetitive
tasks such as data processing and password resets, while synthesizing
huge amounts of information that can be accessed instantly. 

JASPER FOR BUSINESS (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/jasper-for-business-2?utm_source=tldrai]


Jasper is an artificial intelligence platform that helps teams create
high-quality content faster. You can train Jasper on your brand's
voice, collaborate with your team within Jasper, and have Jasper run
in all your day-to-day workflows (email, Google Docs, and more).

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

SPEED UP CODE 2.5X WITH PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT EDITS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://pie4perf.com/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Compilers are excellent for optimizing code, but can only do so much.
This work releases a dataset and models that edit code to improve
run-time performance. The intuition behind this work is that language
models may have better semantic understanding of the code which
provides advantages over standard static analysis. 

ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE LAW (43 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10095?utm_source=tldrai] 

It is infeasible to specify all the possible desired outcomes to a
language model agent. Alignment studies this problem through many
lenses, one new lens is that of legal contracts. Legal contracts face
a similar issue in that they cannot predict every ‚Äúif-then‚Äù
scenario, but require counterparties to reason about the spirit of the
agreement, conditioned on precedence. This paper explores SOTA
language model‚Äôs ability to reason similarly about fiduciary duties
in contracts. The latest OpenAI models are much better than previous
versions, indicating potential positive progress for alignment! 

A BENCHMARK FOR FEW-SHOT REGION-AWARE MACHINE TRANSLATION (6 MINUTE
READ)
[https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/frmt-benchmark-for-few-shot-region.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Machine translation systems don't allow users to specify which
regional variety of a language they want to translate into, which can
lead to confusion or unnatural translations. To address this issue,
Google researchers have created an evaluation dataset called FRMT to
measure MT systems' ability to support regional varieties,
specifically Brazilian vs. European Portuguese and Mainland vs. Taiwan
Mandarin Chinese. They hope this dataset will inspire new ways of
creating more accurate and applicable MT systems for the numerous
regional language varieties spoken worldwide.

RUNNING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ON A SINGLE GPU (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Ying1123/FlexGen?utm_source=tldrai] 

FlexGen is a high-throughput generation engine for running large
language models with limited GPU memory. It improves performance via
‚Äúlightning fast‚Äù offloading when in limited memory environments.
Benchmarks show 1 token per second on a T4 for OPT175B! 

RUST BASED DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/burn-rs/burn?utm_source=tldrai] 

If you're looking for a well written, new, deep learning framework in
Rust, burn seems like a good choice. Their Tensor crate is good to use
standalone. This also is a fun library if you're looking to contribute
to an open source project. 

GRANULAR CONTROL OVER TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION USING T2I-ADAPTERS
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter?utm_source=tldrai] 

This work proposes the use of T2I-Adapters to control the generation
more granularly by aligning internal knowledge in T2I models with
external control signals. This approach can achieve rich control and
editing effects and has practical value due to its composability and
generalization ability. The proposed T2I-Adapter shows promising
generation quality and a wide range of applications, according to
extensive experiments.

WHY CHINA DIDN‚ÄôT INVENT CHATGPT
[https://archive.is/oFThu?utm_source=tldrai] 

China‚Äôs hardening censorship and heavier hand have held back its
tech industry; so has entrepreneurs‚Äô reluctance to invest for the
long term. But this wasn‚Äôt always the case. The author argues that
China‚Äôs control over the private tech sector, geopolitical
relationship with the US, censorship, and lack of chip market have
caused them to fall behind the US in the AI race. 

MY CLASS REQUIRED AI. HERE'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED SO FAR. (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/my-class-required-ai-heres-what-ive?utm_source=tldrai]


Author Ethan Mollick documents how he integrated ChatGPT into his
undergraduate and masters-level entrepreneurship and innovation
classes at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. One
class was built on extensive AI use: it required students to use AI to
help them generate ideas, produce written material, help create apps,
generate images, and more. Another class had assignments that required
students to use AI, and other assignments where AI was optional. The
final class introduced them to AI tools and suggested their use, but
did not have specific AI assignments. Spoiler alert: it has been very
successful, but there are some lessons to be learned.

AI THAT IMPROVES ITSELF THROUGH DARWIN-STYLE EVOLUTION (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-improves-darwinian-evolution?utm_source=tldrai]


A team of computer scientists at Google has created AutoML-Zero, a new
machine learning program that generates algorithms without human
input, selects the best ones, and then mutates them through a process
similar to evolution. The result is the machine is effectively
teaching itself.
