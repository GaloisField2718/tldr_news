HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE'S ‘VERITAS' CHATBOT IS REPORTEDLY AN EMPLOYEE-ONLY TEST OF
SIRI'S AI UPGRADES (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An internal employee-only chatbot, codenamed “Veritas”, is
speculated to be Apple's answer to ChatGPT, but it's unknown if or
when it'll be released publicly. The company has struggled to get its
AI efforts off the ground after a lukewarm reception to its Apple
Intelligence features and multiple delays to Siri upgrades. 

 DEEPSEEK-V3.1-TERMINUS LAUNCHES WITH IMPROVED AGENTIC TOOL USE AND
REDUCED LANGUAGE MIXING ERRORS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek released V3.1-Terminus, which strengthens its Code Agent and
Search Agent and addresses users' feedback about Chinese/English
mix-ups. The model shows benchmark gains in agentic tool tasks
(BrowseComp, SWE Verified, etc.) and offers both “chat” and
“reasoner” modes for different use cases. Terminus remains
open-weight under an MIT license, making it viable for customization
and deployment both via API and local environments. 

 HEAD OF CHATGPT ADDRESSES CONTROVERSIAL MODEL ROUTING (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 OpenAI confirmed it's testing a safety system that automatically
switches users from GPT-4o to reasoning models or GPT-5 when
conversations touch on "sensitive and emotional topics." Users have
complained that the routing triggers too frequently in harmless
situations, pulling them away from GPT-4o, which many prefer for
personal conversations.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE AI VILLAGE IN NUMBERS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's models lead on various stylistic measures like lexical
diversity, positive sentiment, and formality of language, but
Anthropic's models lead in goal-directed behavior. While OpenAI's
models vary in which stylistic measures they excel at, Anthropic's
models all perform well on agentic behavior. OpenAI offers the
brightest, most cheerful, and most eloquent model. Anthropic's models
tend to excel at getting stuff done. 

 OPENAI RELEASES WORKPLACE USAGE REPORT SHOWING RAPID CHATGPT ADOPTION
(20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 28% of US workers now use ChatGPT at work, with adoption highest
among highly educated white collar workers in tech, finance, and
manufacturing. It's vague exactly how the tool is being used - OpenAI
is primarily for writing, research, programming, and data analysis -
but technical teams have emerged as the clear power users.

 CAN YOU BUILD SECURE AI AT SCALE? TAKE THE CHALLENGE AT DEVSECCON
2025 (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Something big is brewing October 22: the FIRST ever AI Security
Developers Challenge [10] at DevSecCon 2025 (virtual). Team up with
brilliant minds globally to solve real AI security problems. Also on
the agenda: hands-on demos, cutting-edge talks from Tessl and Ragie.ai
experts, and practical strategies for securing AI applications at
scale. Save your spot [10] 

 MODULAR MANIFOLDS - THINKING MACHINES LAB (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Normally, neural networks are trained by letting their weights move
freely in any mathematical direction. A new method that restricts the
weights to specific curved surfaces makes training more stable and
predictable. This "manifold Muon" optimizer forces weight matrices to
maintain consistent properties (like not stretching or shrinking data
too dramatically) by constraining them to geometric shapes called
manifolds. While promising, the experiments required computational
overhead, which limits real-world adoption. 

 WE REVERSE-ENGINEERED FLASH ATTENTION 4 (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Flash Attention 4 is a brand new, highly optimized CUDA kernel that
speeds up the attention calculations in transformers, which are the
main mathematical operations that bottleneck AI models like ChatGPT.
However, the improvements from FA4 are not from clever new math but
from improvements in how an incredibly complex async pipeline splits
computations across 32-thread ‘warps'. 

 WHAT PROBLEM IS DSPY SOLVING WITH WHAT ASSUMPTIONS (9 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 DSPY's programming model is a good base, but it has issues with
defaults and missing affordances. This post identifies these issues
and suggests some changes. Adopting these changes would sharpen DSPy's
design without fighting it. It would keep the ergonomics that makes
teams productive while aligning the optimization layer with the
realities of fixed budgets and production constraints.

 EXPANDING OUR DATA ENGINE FOR PHYSICAL AI (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Scale is expanding its Data Engine for Physical AI, providing
robotics companies with high-quality, annotated datasets needed for
training foundation models in physical environments. It addresses the
robotics data gap by ensuring datasets are abundant, diverse, and
enriched, collecting data through dedicated robots and human
demonstrations. This aims to accelerate the development of reliable AI
systems capable of handling real-world complexity in various
applications.
