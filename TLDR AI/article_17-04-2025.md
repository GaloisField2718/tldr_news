 RUN MODEL INFERENCE ON NVIDIA B200 GPUS WITH BASETEN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Baseten is now offering inference on NVIDIA B200 GPUs. B200s are
ideal for workloads with aggressive throughput, latency, and cost
requirements. By leveraging B200 GPUs, Baseten customers are
achieving:

📈 5x higher throughput

📉 50%+ lower cost per token

📉 38% lower latency for the largest LLMs

With B200 GPUs, you can run models like DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen to
power code generation, search, reasoning agents, and more. Get access
to Baseten's B200s and run performant applications at scale.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK CANVAS-LIKE TOOL FOR DOCUMENT CREATION (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grok, the chatbot from xAI, now includes Grok Studio, a canvas-like
tool to build documents and basic apps. It's now live for all users. 

 LATENTS FOR GENERATIVE MODELING (61 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Candidate for best blog post of the year for folks interested in
generative modeling. This post breaks down the history, intuition, and
key innovations for learned latents. 

 OPENAI O3 AND O4-MINI (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has released the new o3 and o4-mini models, which improve
ChatGPT's tool use and enable smarter, faster reasoning with
integrated web search, file analysis, and image generation. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 NVIDIA'S TEMPORALLY CONSISTENT VIDEO DIFFUSION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NVIDIA's EquivDM is a framework that enhances video diffusion by
using consistent noise for better motion tracking and 3D-consistent
outputs with fewer sampling steps. 

 INTELLECT 2 DISTRIBUTED TRAINING (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prime Intellect has trained a 32B network, fully distributed, with
reinforcement learning for reasoning. It has open sourced a
substantial amount of its code and useful libraries. 

 M1: TOWARDS SCALABLE TEST-TIME COMPUTE WITH MAMBA REASONING MODELS
(30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 M1 is a Mamba reasoning model that has been trained with extended
test time computation. It doesn't fully match state-of-the-art models,
but it shows strong performance, especially on long context and
through-put. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DEEPMATH DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 103K examples of highly filtered and decontaminated math problems for
reasoning model training. 

 PRIMA CPP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Prima CPP is an extension of llama.cpp that tries to enable mmaping
of memory for large models to enable them to run on low RAM
environments. 

 TILE LANGUAGE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Tile Language is a concise domain-specific language designed to
streamline the development of high-performance GPU/CPU kernels (e.g.,
GEMM, Dequant GEMM, FlashAttention, and LinearAttention). By employing
a Pythonic syntax with an underlying compiler infrastructure on top of
TVM, it allows developers to focus on productivity without sacrificing
the low-level optimizations necessary for state-of-the-art
performance.
