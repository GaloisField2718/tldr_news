 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION — AGENTS, INTEGRATIONS,
WORKFLOWS, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to become part of your organizational DNA - and that
means enabling every department to build out their own use cases,
without IT gatekeepers standing in the way. But it shouldn't mean an
ungoverned free-for-all.

Airia is the “let's get serious about AI adoption” platform [4].
Rapidly prototype, deploy, and manage AI agents that transform
workflows across your organization - without sacrificing security or
governance.

Connect to dozens of enterprise applications with native integrations.
Build agents quickly with templates and no-code tools [4]. Let
everyone build with AI while maintaining visibility and control.

Plans start at just $49/month. Get a demo [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK-V3.2 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepSeek's V3.2 matches GPT-5, and its higher-compute V3.2-Speciale
variant rivals Gemini-3.0-Pro and earned gold medals at IMO, IOI, and
ICPC 2025. 

 INTRODUCING RUNWAY GEN-4.5: A NEW FRONTIER FOR VIDEO GENERATION (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gen-4.5 topped the Artificial Analysis text-to-video benchmark, ahead
of Veo 3 and Sora. The model emphasizes physical accuracy (realistic
momentum, fluid motion, and material coherence). Runway has
acknowledged persisting issues with object permanence. 

 EARLY LOOK: GEMINI'S CHATGPT-STYLE 'PROJECTS' ARE TAKING SHAPE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has been working on a new 'projects' option for Gemini. The
feature will allow users to sort files and chats around particular
topics. Projects can be pinned for easy access. There is a 10-file
limit, but paying users may receive a higher ceiling.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO VERIFYING CODE AT SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI trained an agentic code reviewer for Codex since noisy safety
tools are inevitably bypassed. The system now handles 100k+ external
PRs daily, providing repo-wide context and execution access.
Internally, it has caught launch-blocking bugs and protected
high-stakes experiments. 

 THE END OF THE TRAIN-TEST SPLIT (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Models don't know what is 'out of distribution' for themselves.
Engineers will always be required in the loop until this problem is
solved. It will never be easy to check the accuracy of models.
Researchers need to look at their data, make sure it's clean, and
label it correctly. 

 HOW CAN INTERPRETABILITY RESEARCHERS HELP AGI GO WELL? (32 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The Google DeepMind mechanistic interpretability team has pivoted to
a pragmatic approach to interpretability over the last year. It is
important to have empirical feedback on goals with good proxy tasks.
Near-complete understanding isn't required for significant impact.
Good focused projects start with a theory of change, and good
exploratory projects start with a robustly useful setting.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 CUT THE COST OF IT COMPLEXITY (SPONSOR) [11] 

 IT complexity can drive costs up across your company. Intelligent IT
automation is key to taming technology chaos. Get the insights you
need from the IBM Institute for Business Value. 👉 Read the IBV
report [12] 

 NVIDIA LAUNCHES VISION LANGUAGE MODEL FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Nvidia introduced Alpamayo-R1, the first open-source vision language
action model designed for autonomous driving, at NeurIPS. Alpamayo-R1
integrates visual and textual reasoning to enhance decision-making in
real-world environments. 

 STARFLOW: SCALABLE TRANSFORMER AUTO-REGRESSIVE FLOW (HUGGING FACE
REPO) [14] 

 STARFlow and STARFlow-V are state-of-the-art transformer
autoregressive flow models for high-quality image and video
generation. STARFlow introduces a novel transformer autoregressive
flow architecture that combines the expressiveness of autoregressive
models with the efficiency of normalizing flows. STARFlow-V is an
end-to-end video generative model with normalizing flows. Examples of
generated videos and comparisons are available. 

 BRIDGE MODELS FOR IMAGE AND VIDEO TRANSLATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 ViBT introduces Vision Bridge Transformers, scaling Brownian Bridge
Models to 20B parameters for efficient conditional generation. The
models use a Transformer architecture and a variance-stabilized
objective for robust performance on image and video editing tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENAI TAKES STAKE IN THRIVE HOLDINGS, A BUYER OF SERVICES FIRMS (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has taken an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings to embed AI
into high-volume business processes, beginning with accounting and IT
services. OpenAI teams will work directly inside Thrive's companies to
improve speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency. 

 BYTEDANCE'S TIKTOK PLAYBOOK IS WINNING CONSUMER AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 ByteDance's Doubao app is now China's most popular mobile AI
platform. It received more than 11.4 million downloads in October.
Doubao's focus on frictionless AI-powered voice, image, and video
experiences sets it apart from competitors. ByteDance keeps its most
advanced technology proprietary, breaking away from China's
open-source approach. This could give it a durable commercial edge.
