 THE MONETIZATION OPERATING MODEL: THE NEW PRICING AND BILLING
PLAYBOOK FOR THE AI ERA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI has broken traditional pricing models. And if you're still
charging for seats, you're NGMI. But very few companies have found an
accurate and sustainable pricing model for AI value.

Metronome's new and highly anticipated whitepaper [4] offers a
practical framework for navigating this shift, based on Metronome's
work with AI leaders including OpenAI, Databricks, and NVIDIA. It
tackles hard questions such as:

 	* Understanding what you're actually metering (agent invocations,
tokens, etc.)
 	* The infrastructure needed to support value-based pricing
 	* What it means to bill for outcomes

This operating model [4] is a must-read for anyone grappling with AI
pricing. Grab your free copy [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI LAUNCHES A SUB $5 CHATGPT PLAN IN INDIA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has launched a new subscription plan in India called ChatGPT
Go. Priced at ₹399 per month ($4.60), the plan increases message,
image generation, and file upload limits by 10 times over the free
tier. It also enables better memory retention for more personalized
responses. The plan is geo-restricted to India - OpenAI plans to
expand the plan to more regions. 

 GRAMMARLY SAYS ITS AI AGENT CAN PREDICT AN A PAPER (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Grammarly released a suite of new AI tools today, including a grader
agent that uses course details and publicly available instructor
information to predict grades. Other agents handle citation
generation, plagiarism detection, and reader reaction predictions. 

 AI-POWERED FORMULA IN EXCEL (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The COPILOT function for Excel on Windows and Mac allows users to
enter natural language prompts directly in cells to perform tasks like
summarizing, categorizing, or generating data.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GPT-5 GOES HARD ON REAL-WORLD PROGRAMMING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GPT-5 appears to be incredibly adept at writing code that solves
issues end-to-end. This post looks at how GPT-5 solved the problem of
writing a parser for a complex binary format. The resulting code is
usable and very performant. GPT-5 produces minimal, viable edits, and
it is more steerable than previous models. 

 THE NVIDIA AI GPU BLACK MARKET (3.5 HOUR VIDEO) [9] 

 This documentary features direct interviews with smugglers, dealers,
and manufacturers across Hong Kong and Shenzhen, documenting how
export-controlled chips flow from US Facebook Marketplace sales to
Chinese warehouses. Reporters filmed transactions with smugglers
buying RTX 4090s for $2,000 and buying modified cards from underground
shops to turbocharge GPUs beyond what Nvidia offers. NVIDIA dismissed
the smuggling evidence as "tall tales."

 GOOGLE GEMINI URL CONTEXT (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The url_context tool in the Gemini API allows models to request the
content of URLs as part of a reply to a prompt. Pages accessed with
the tool will receive a request from a Google IP that appears to feed
the original raw HTML to the model without executing JavaScript on the
page. 

 APIS DON'T MAKE GOOD MCP TOOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 MCP has become the de facto standard for giving large language models
access to tools that someone else wrote. However, writing tools for a
new MCP server is hard, so people often propose auto-converting
existing APIs into MCP tools. This doesn't work well because agents
don't do well with large numbers of tools, APIs can blow through
context windows quickly, and APIs don't make the most of agents'
unique capabilities. Agents can just call APIs if they need to do
that. They do best when given tools that are designed for their unique
capabilities and limitations. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT GPUS (79 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article looks at how Nvidia GPUs work, how they're networked
together, and what that means for large language models, especially
compared to TPUs. A modern machine learning GPU is basically a bunch
of compute cores that specialize in matrix multiplication connected to
a stick of fast memory. TPUs are dedicated matrix multiplication
machines that are cheap, predictable, and great if used as intended.
Networking is one of the areas where GPUs and TPUs differ the most -
TPUs are connected in 2D or 3D tori, where each TPU is only connected
to its neighbors, while GPUs use a more tree-based switching network.

 THE GREAT COGNITIVE HANDOFF: HOW AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT IS REWIRING
CIVILIZATION (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The old model, where humans think and computers execute, is obsolete.
Now, humans steer while AI thinks. Soon, we'll see IDEs that dream,
code that evolves, collective coding consciousness, and
intention-based programming. We're no longer building software, we're
building consciousness infrastructure.
