 HOW AI IS CHANGING SEARCH, FROM BACK- TO FRONT-END (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Search has long been a the most important piece of the online
shopping experience — and in recent years, AI has turned that
experience on its head.

Generative AI is changing how developers approach the architecture and
capabilities [4] of user-facing systems like search, and how data are
indexed and retrieved in the back-end.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AWS IS LAUNCHING AN AI AGENT MARKETPLACE NEXT WEEK WITH ANTHROPIC AS
A PARTNER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AWS will launch an AI agent marketplace next week at the AWS Summit
in New York City, with Anthropic as a partner. The platform will
enable startups to offer AI agents directly to AWS customers,
potentially boosting Anthropic's reach and revenue. This move follows
similar initiatives by Google Cloud and Microsoft, aiming to
streamline AI agent distribution. 

 AMAZON CONSIDERS ANOTHER MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN ANTHROPIC
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Amazon is considering another multibillion-dollar investment in AI
firm Anthropic to strengthen their strategic partnership. It already
committed $8 billion in November last year. Amazon is one of
Anthropic's largest shareholders. Google, another shareholder, has
invested over $3 billion. 

 DEVSTRAL MODELS FOR CODE AGENTS (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mistral AI and All Hands AI released Devstral Medium and upgraded
Devstral Small 1.1, optimized for agentic coding tasks. Devstral Small
1.1 is open-source under Apache 2.0 and outperforms all other open
models for code agents.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE ARCHITECTURE BEHIND LOVABLE AND BOLT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The success of a coding app depends on context engineering and
software architecture, not raw model capabilities. Both platforms
share four core components: typed prompts with test-driven
development, MCP servers for sandboxed execution, agent loops for
state management, and real-time frontend coordination. 

 AI IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AT GOOGLE: PROGRESS AND THE PATH AHEAD (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There is widespread enthusiasm among Google software engineers about
how AI is helping write code. This blog post looks at the company's
newest AI-powered improvements and presents a method for building AI
products that deliver value. Google monitors developer productivity
and satisfaction carefully - the improvements covered in the post
directly impact these. Google prioritizes by technical feasibility and
impact, iterates quickly and extracts lessons learned, and extensively
monitors productivity and satisfaction metrics to measure
effectiveness. 

 AI TOOLS MAKE EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS SLOWER, METR STUDY FINDS (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A randomized controlled trial of 16 experienced open-source
developers found AI tools decreased task completion time by 19%,
despite developers self-reporting a 24% speedup.

 BATCH MODE IN THE GEMINI API: PROCESS MORE FOR LESS (4 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The Gemini API now has an asynchronous endpoint designed for
high-throughput, non-latency-critical workloads. The Gemini API Batch
Mode allows users to submit large jobs, offload the scheduling and
processing, and retrieve results within 24 hours, with a 50% discount
compared to the synchronous APIs. It is the perfect tool for when
users have data ready upfront and don't need an immediate response. 

 ASYNCMCP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 asyncmcp is a regular MCP that works over queues. A lot of context is
not always readily available, and it takes time for applications to
process it. asyncmcp uses an async transport layer, so it doesn't have
to immediately respond to any requests - it chooses to direct them to
internal queues for processing and the client doesn't have to stick
around for the response. 

 T5GEMMA: ENCODER-DECODER MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google's T5Gemma is a suite of encoder-decoder LLMs adapted from
decoder-only Gemma 2 models. Designed for tasks like summarization and
translation, T5Gemma includes pretrained and instruction-tuned
variants in sizes ranging from 2B to XL. 

 FLEXOLMO: LLM TRAINING WITHOUT SHARING RAW DATA (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The first of its kind, this architecture allows data contributors to
activate or deactivate their contributions in real-time without
retraining the entire model, enabling instant modification. The system
trains separate expert modules on private datasets using a frozen
public model as an anchor point, then merges them via domain-informed
routing without requiring joint training.

 THE ONLY SAAS FEATURE YOU SHOULD BE BUILDING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Before companies can get to a future where real work happens through
AI agents that interact with both data and people, companies have to
solve the action interface for human operators. The action interface
matters because most operators aren't prompt engineers - their job is
to keep the world moving. Operators need a clean interface that lets
them react to and confirm actions and a way to proactively ask the
system to take actions. This article discusses a new paradigm for
building interfaces that creates a seamless experience for operators. 

 IMAGE-TO-VIDEO GENERATION IN GOOGLE'S VEO 3 (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google has added speech generation to Flow, its AI video tool,
allowing users to transform images into talking clips using Veo 3.
Alongside this, Flow and Google AI Ultra are now available in over 140
countries, expanding access to advanced video and AI features
worldwide.
