HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

CHROMA‚ÄôS $18M SEED FUNDING (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.trychroma.com/blog/seed?utm_source=tldrai] 

Another big funding announcement for an open source tool for AI. This
time the fast growing embeddings database company raises cash.
They‚Äôre hoping that folks will use their tools to add state and
memory to different LLM applications. The goal is for this to reduce
hallucinations and increase factuality. They‚Äôre growing quickly,
it‚Äôll be interesting to see how all the different LLMOps tools come
together.

HOW DOES TRAINING A MODEL WITH RLHF ACTUALLY WORK? (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/stackllama?utm_source=tldrai] 

Training a model on an unsupervised dataset is so last year. Using
human feedback data is all the rage and while it sounds easy in theory
- it turns out to be tricky in practice. The HuggingFace folks have
written another great blog showcasing StackLLaMA which answers
StackExchange-like questions. 

VISION TRANSFORMERS WITH MIXED-RESOLUTION TOKENIZATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00287?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes a new approach to Vision Transformers by
introducing a mixed-resolution sequence of tokens to replace the
standard uniform grid, where each token represents a patch of
arbitrary size. This approach uses the Quadtree algorithm and a novel
saliency scorer to construct a patch mosaic that processes important
image regions with higher resolution while routing low-saliency areas
in low resolution, resulting in significant accuracy gains on image
classification while controlling for the computational budget.

VIDEOCRAFTER: A TOOLKIT FOR TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION AND EDITING
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/VideoCrafter/VideoCrafter?utm_source=tldrai] 

VideoCrafter is an open-source video generation and editing toolbox
for crafting video content, which contains three models: Generic
Text-to-video Generation, Personalized Text-to-Video Generation with
LoRA, and Video Generation with More Condition Controls 

TM2D: BIMODALITY DRIVEN 3D DANCE GENERATION VIA MUSIC-TEXT INTEGRATION
(GITHUB REPO) [https://garfield-kh.github.io/TM2D/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes a new task that utilizes both music and text for 3D
dance generation, which can guide humans to perform richer movements.
To tackle the challenge of the existing datasets containing paired
motion with a single modality, the authors utilize a 3D human motion
VQ-VAE to project the motions of the two datasets into a latent space,
and propose a cross-modal transformer architecture to integrate text
instructions. The approach generates realistic and coherent dance
motion conditioned on both music and text, while keeping comparable
performance conditioned on two single modalities. 

E2B (GITHUB REPO) [https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b?utm_source=tldrai] 

E2b is an open-source IDE powered by AI agents that do the work for
you.
