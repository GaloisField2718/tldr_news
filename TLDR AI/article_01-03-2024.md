HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 FIGURE RAISES $675M FOR ROBOTICS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figure, a robotics company, has raised $675M from several large
investors, including OpenAI, to continue building humanoid robotics. 

 MODULAR MAX DEVELOPERS EDITION (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modular created a toolkit, MAX, to dramatically simplify and speed up
AI deployments. It is now available. 

 GENIE: GENERATIVE INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google DeepMind's Genie is a foundation world model trained on
Internet videos that can generate an endless variety of playable
(action-controllable) worlds from synthetic images, photographs, and
even sketches. 

üß† 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VIDEO SEGMENTATION WITH A UNIFIED ARCHITECTURE (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UniVS is a unified architecture for video segmentation that tackles
the challenges of various segmentation tasks with a novel prompt-based
approach. By leveraging prompt features as queries and introducing a
target-wise prompt cross-attention layer, UniVS eliminates the need
for heuristic inter-frame matching, seamlessly adapting to different
video segmentation scenarios. 

 IMAGE SYNTHESIS WITH COARSE-TO-FINE LATENT DIFFUSION (14 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method introduces a new
approach to Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis that overcomes the
limitations of existing models by avoiding overfitting through a deep
semantic understanding of images. 

 LLM QUANTIZATION: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Post-training quantization can make large language models like OPT
and LLaMA2 more memory- and compute-efficient.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 PRIVACY PRESERVING SYNTHETIC DATA FOR LLMS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Create synthetic data from your existing unstructured data to train
models without exposing your sensitive data to LLMs. With Tonic
Textual [12], you can automatically identify, redact, and synthesize
named entities and sensitive data [12] so that you can leverage the
power of LLMs without compromising privacy. Start free [12] 

 3D MAPPING WITH LIGHTWEIGHT NEURAL NETWORKS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This project introduces a new approach to 3D mapping and localization
that uses a lightweight neural network to process both point and line
features, significantly enhancing pose accuracy with less memory and
computational demand. 

 LEARNING TO GENERATE INSTRUCTION TUNING DATASETS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Bonito is an open-source model designed to convert unannotated text
into tailored training datasets, enhancing the adaptability of large
language models to specialized tasks without requiring pre-existing
annotations. 

 EXPLORING VIDEO UNDERSTANDING WITH LLMA (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This repository contains a collection of useful resources focused on
video understanding using large language models. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 MIST TEXT TO SPEECH (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Rime has launched a new text-to-speech model with powerful
conversational abilities. Unlike previous models, this one can include
‚Äúums‚Äù and realistic pauses. 

 THE PARADOX OF DIFFUSION DISTILLATION (30 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Diffusion models break down hard problems, like image generation,
into many smaller problems, like removing a tiny amount of noise from
an image. A lot of effort has been put into single step diffusion
generation, which seems to defeat the point. This post explores the
paradox of diffusion distillation and outlines the many research
directions available. 

 ADD YOUR OWN OLLAMA MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Instructions on how to add your own models to the Ollama repository
for use.
