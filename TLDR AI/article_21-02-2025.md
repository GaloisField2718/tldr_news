 AI IS TRANSFORMING SAAS PRICING—ARE YOU READY? A DISCUSSION WITH
METRONOME AND KYLE POYAR (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The shift from seat-based pricing models to usage-based pricing (UBP)
has been going on for a while — but AI is pushing companies to
evolve their pricing models further and faster.

Kyle Poyar is an expert on SaaS pricing and on February 26th, he will
be joining Metronome's new pricing webinar series [4], where they'll
discuss:

 	* UBP and aligning pricing with customer value
 	* New trends such as AI-driven pricing and outcome-based models [4]
 	* 2025 pricing predictions and how to stay competitive

 QWEN 2.5 VL TECHNICAL REPORT (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Report for the strongest open weights vision language model from the
Qwen team. 

 END TO END DRIVING RL MODEL TRAINED WITH GAUSSIAN SPLATS (25 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Interesting proof of concept paper that uses Photorealistic
environments rendered with 3D Gaussian splats. It achieves a 3x lower
collision rate overall. 

 MODEL-GUIDANCE FOR DIFFUSION MODELS (14 MINUTE READ) [10]

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EFFICIENT WEB CRAWLING FOR LLM PRE-TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Most data from web crawls gets thrown away due to poor text
extraction performance. This work dramatically improves how many
documents get saved and uses that to train stronger models on a
fraction of the crawled data. 

 OPEN REASONER ZERO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Open replication of the zero reasoning paradigm. It is fully open
source with training data, scripts, and weights. 

 EVALUATING FACTUALITY IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LLM-Oasis is a large-scale dataset designed to train and evaluate
systems for assessing factuality in outputs from LLMs.

 AN AI ALCHEMIST AND HIS DEEPSEEK JOURNEY (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Wenfeng Liang, a hedge fund manager, launched DeepSeek, a self-funded
open-source AI platform that has rapidly gained global attention for
its innovative LLMs like DeepSeek-R1, comparable to OpenAI's models.
Using more cost-effective training methods and consumer-grade hardware
compatibility, DeepSeek has sparked interest among both major tech
companies and small institutions. Liang's focus on open-source AI
development, backed by his success with Magic Square Quantitative,
emphasizes collaboration and technological progress over commercial
pressures. 

 FLEX 1 IMAGE GENERATION MODEL (HUGGING FACE HUB) [15] 

 An interesting side project from the community. This was a model
fine-tuned from Flux Schnell, which means it is Apache licensed. It is
designed to be fine-tuned at 8B parameters and runs quite quickly
while not sacrificing performance. 

 PYTORCH COMPILER ROADMAP (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Development roadmap for the next year for the PyTorch compilation
team.
