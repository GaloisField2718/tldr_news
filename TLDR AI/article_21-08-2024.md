HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 FINE-TUNING NOW AVAILABLE FOR GPT-4O (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has launched fine-tuning for GPT-4o, allowing developers to
customize the model for specific use cases with their own datasets. It
is offering 1 million free training tokens per day through September
23. 

 OPENAI STRIKES SEARCH DEAL WITH CONDE NAST (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has entered a multi-year licensing agreement with Cond√© Nast,
allowing it to display content from the publisher's brands, such as
Vogue and The New Yorker, within its products, including ChatGPT and
SearchGPT. 

 META'S SELF-TAUGHT EVALUATOR ENABLES LLMS TO CREATE THEIR OWN
TRAINING DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta FAIR researchers have introduced the Self-Taught Evaluator, a
method to train evaluative LLMs without human annotations, potentially
enhancing the efficiency and scalability of LLM assessment. Using the
LLM-as-a-Judge concept, it iteratively generates and refines responses
to create a training dataset, demonstrating improved performance on
benchmarks like RewardBench. This technique could enable enterprises
to leverage unlabeled data for LLM tuning while acknowledging the
importance of a well-aligned seed model and the limitations of
benchmarks.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MESHFORMER3D (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A fast, cheap, and state-of-the-art 3D mesh generation model that can
be conditioned on images or text. Specifically, it uses signed
distance function supervision and a cascade of steps such as a normal
map generator that offloads different tasks to various submodels. 

 SHORTCIRCUIT: ALPHAZERO-DRIVEN CIRCUIT DESIGN (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Automating and optimizing chip design with AI can reduce costs and
meet demand for stronger chips. This method was tested on many
circuits, generating compact and efficient designs with a success rate
of 84.6% using an Alpha Zero based approach. 

 AUTOMATED DESIGN OF AGENTIC SYSTEMS (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This is a great paper that discusses how brittle modern agent systems
are and what the path forward could be to design learned systems. Its
authors use programming languages as a test bed where agents can be
designed and run unsupervised.

 HIGH-EFFICIENCY OPTICAL FLOW ESTIMATION ON EDGE DEVICES (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 Extremely fast and efficient optical flow code that can be run on low
power devices such as phones and some security camera systems. 

 X-RAY REPORT GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A new framework was developed for generating X-ray medical reports
that enhances performance while reducing computational complexity. 

 CONTROLLABLE TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION USING MOUSE TRAJECTORIES
(GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 TraDiffusion is a new method for guiding text-to-image generation
using mouse trajectories instead of traditional box or mask controls.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY DIFFUSION COULD HELP LLMS REASON (26 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Current language models predict one word at a time, which gives very
little room for planning and reasoning. There are ways around this
such as Chain of Thought prompting. However, potentially using
diffusion models, which can spend more diffusion steps per token,
could be a way to improve model reasoning. 

 AI COMPANIES ARE PIVOTING FROM CREATING GODS TO BUILDING PRODUCTS (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI companies have overestimated the readiness of generative AI for
widespread commercial use, leading to costly missteps in product
development and market integration. As they try to correct course,
they must overcome five key challenges: ensuring cost-effectiveness,
improving reliability, safeguarding privacy, enhancing safety and
security, and refining user interfaces. These obstacles highlight the
gap between AI's potential capabilities and the practical realities of
deploying AI systems that meet consumer expectations and integrate
seamlessly into existing workflows. The path to widespread adoption
will likely unfold over a decade or more, rather than the rapid
timeline some have predicted.
