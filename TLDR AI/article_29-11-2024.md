HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ALIBABA CHALLENGING OPENAI'S O1 WITH A NEW MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Alibaba has released QwQ-32B-Preview, an ‘open' challenger to
OpenAI's o1 reasoning model. 

 AI2 RELEASES NEW LANGUAGE MODELS COMPETITIVE WITH META'S LLAMA (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ai2 has released OLMo 2, an open-source language model series with
models containing 7 and 13 billion parameters. OLMo 2 is developed
with publicly accessible training data and code. Aiming to boost
open-source AI innovation, Ai2 claims these models outperform similar
open models like Meta's Llama 3.1. The models are available under the
Apache 2.0 license for commercial use. 

 XAI COULD SOON HAVE ITS OWN APP (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk's xAI plans to launch a standalone app for its Grok chatbot
by December, competing directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Grok is
currently accessible through X for subscribers only. This move
positions xAI to more directly challenge established chatbot apps from
OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THUNDERKITTENS FOR APPLE SILICON (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hazy Research has been critical in improving hardware utilization for
AI workloads. It has extended its amazing ThunderKittens Kernel
writing framework to work on Apple Silicon. 

 DIFFUSIONDRIVE: TRUNCATED DIFFUSION MODEL FOR END-TO-END AUTONOMOUS
DRIVING (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Diffusion models for End-to-End driving of autonomous vehicles which
can operate at 45 FPS on a 4090 chip. 

 SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH LOW-BIT QUANTIZATION (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PassionSR introduces an approach that makes diffusion-based image
super-resolution (SR) models more hardware-friendly. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 OPEN INSTRUCT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The Allen AI Institute has released extremely useful post training
code for instruction tuning. 

 STAR ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Up to 11x speed improvement for long context token processing and
generation. It is slightly better than ring attention, but still worse
than full attention. 

 FINE-GRAINED IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [13]

 IT'S SURPRISINGLY EASY TO JAILBREAK LLM-DRIVEN ROBOTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 RoboPAIR is an algorithm that successfully jailbreaks robots powered
by LLMs, bypassing all safety guardrails. Experiments showed a 100%
success rate in hacking systems like Go2, a self-driving simulator,
and robot dogs. These findings reveal significant security
vulnerabilities, stressing the need for better defenses against
LLM-based robot hacking. 

 WORLD'S MOST FLEXIBLE SOUND MACHINE DEBUTS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Fugatto, a new generative AI model, allows users to control audio
creation and transformation using text prompts. It can generate music,
modify voices, and create unique sounds, showcasing capabilities
through tasks like music production and video game development.
Developed by NVIDIA researchers, Fugatto uses 2.5 billion parameters
and was trained on a vast dataset to handle multilingual audio tasks
and unsupervised learning. 

 THE NEW AI SCALING LAW SHELL GAME (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Recent shifts in AI scaling laws reveal limitations in predictability
and effectiveness, with new models not meeting earlier expectations.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella highlights "inference time compute" as a
potential area of focus, but concerns about cost and reliability
persist. Innovation beyond scaling is needed. LLMs should be part of a
broader AI strategy.
