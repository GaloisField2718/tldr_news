HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPEN MATH OLYMPIAD MODEL RELEASED (HUGGING FACE HUB) [4] 

 The Hugging Face team has released an extremely powerful and strong
math model. 

 CLAUDE ADDS A PROMPT PLAYGROUND TO QUICKLY IMPROVE YOUR AI APPS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's new features in Claude allow developers to automate
prompt engineering, improving AI application development by
generating, testing, and refining prompts with quick feedback. 

 MICROSOFT, APPLE GIVE UP OBSERVER SEATS ON OPENAI'S BOARD (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Microsoft and Apple have opted not to join OpenAI's board due to
regulatory scrutiny, with Microsoft stepping down from its observer
role and Apple reversing plans to become an observer.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ADDING IMAGE GENERATION BACK TO CHAMELEON (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anole is an open autoregressive multimodal model built on Meta's
Chameleon model. This work adds image generation capabilities back
into the model with targeted fine-tuning. 

 PERSONALIZED TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers introduce a new reinforcement learning framework to
improve personalized text-to-image generation. 

 3D DATA GENERATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PerlDiff is a method that improves the precision of street view image
generation by integrating 3D geometric information.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 PAINTS UNDO GENERATIVE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 From the creator of ControlNet, IC-Light, and many other image
generation systems, Paints UNDO is a system where a model creates
strokes that are used to recreate an image. Interestingly, unlike
previous stroke systems, this model can undo strokes and often
rethinks its approach entirely part way through - very similarly to a
human artist. 

 MINRF (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Scalable Rectified Flow Transformers are used, in part, for Stable
Diffusion 3. This repository is a minimal implementation of this that
also includes muP hyperparameter sweeps. 

 ROUTELLM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A framework for serving and evaluating LLM routers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ADVANCING 3D PERCEPTION IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (38 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SuperFlow is a new framework that enhances 3D perception in
autonomous driving by using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs for
spatiotemporal pretraining. 

 A DEEP DIVE ON AI INFERENCE STARTUPS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 One popular area of VC investing is building the ‚Äúpicks and
shovels‚Äù for AI (e.g. model fine-tuning, observability, and
inference). VCs are betting that companies will not want to build
things in-house as they add AI to their products. The TAM for AI
inference is quite constrained. VCs need to believe in massive TAM
expansion for their investments to pay off. While AI inference
platforms are a boon for startups in the short term, they are
detrimental to startups over longer periods. 

 CYCLISTS CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO FEAR OR LOVE SELF-DRIVING CARS (8
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cyclists in San Francisco have reported close encounters and safety
concerns with Waymo's and Cruise's autonomous vehicles. Nearly 200
complaints have been made to the California DMV highlighting erratic
driving and near-misses involving these self-driving cars. While the
companies claim their vehicles have enhanced safety features, the
incidents raise questions about their readiness for broader deployment
amidst increased regulatory scrutiny.
