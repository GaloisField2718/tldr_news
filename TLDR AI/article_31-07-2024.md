RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THEIA: DISTILLING DIVERSE VISION FOUNDATION MODELS FOR ROBOT LEARNING
(28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper introduces Theia, a vision foundation model for robot
learning that integrates multiple existing vision models. Theia offers
rich visual representations, enhancing robot learning with less
training data and smaller model sizes. Experiments show that Theia
outperforms its predecessors, and the authors suggest that higher
entropy in feature norms improves performance. The code and models are
available for public use. 

 SAULLM-54B & SAULLM-141B: SCALING UP DOMAIN ADAPTATION FOR THE LEGAL
DOMAIN (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B, two large language
models designed for the legal sector that feature 54 billion and 141
billion parameters. Using the Mixtral architecture, the researchers
employed large-scale domain adaptation through continued pre-training
with a vast legal corpus, a specialized legal instruction-following
protocol, aligning outputs with human legal interpretations. The
models outperform previous open-source models on LegalBench-Instruct
and offer state-of-the-art performance. Base, instruct, and aligned
versions of these models have been released under the MIT License for
reuse and collaborative research. 

 RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH GRAPH CONVOLUTIONS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LightGODE is a new approach to improve the efficiency and scalability
of recommender systems. It bypasses intensive computations during
training by focusing on post-training graph convolution and utilizing
a continuous graph ODE.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WRITER SETS A NEW BAR FOR FINANCIAL LLMS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Today, Writer welcomed Palmyra-Fin to their family of enterprise
LLMs. The model brings unparalleled accuracy to financial generative
AI applications ‚Äî outperforming leading frontier models in a
head-to-head test. In a first for finance, Palmyra-Fin even passed the
CFA Level III exam [12].

Palmyra-Fin is now live¬† on the Writer full-stack generative AI
platform [11] ‚Äî allowing developers to build with their APIs,
open-source Python framework, or no-code builder.

 FACE IMAGE RESOLUTION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Researchers have developed a wavelet-based feature enhancement
network to improve face super-resolution. The method enhances facial
details without introducing distortions by decomposing input features
into high and low-frequency components and using a full domain
Transformer. 

 CHART QUESTION ANSWERING WITH MULTIMODAL MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project proposes a new method to improve chart question
answering using multimodal large language models. 

 TRAJECTORY PREDICTION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 DGFNet is a new approach for predicting the trajectories of multiple
traffic participants in autonomous driving. It enhances predictions by
considering the difficulty differences among agents, capturing rich
spatio-temporal features, and using a difficulty-guided decoder.

 AI IS A SERVICES REVOLUTION (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article discusses the impact of LLMs on the service economy,
particularly on knowledge work sectors such as legal, healthcare, and
education. While rapid AI advancements suggest significant automation
potential, the adoption by enterprises is slow, with many still in the
experimentation phase. Actual deployment is expected to be gradual.
Specialized AI startups that leverage LLMs to improve
industry-specific workflows will have a competitive advantage in the
evolving market. 

 THE AI JOB INTERVIEWER WILL SEE YOU NOW (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI-powered job interviews, which leverage large language models for
automation and potential bias reduction, are being increasingly
adopted by firms globally. Companies like Meituan and multinationals
are using AI avatars to conduct initial interviews, perceiving them as
efficient despite concerns over potential embedded biases and
transparency in decision-making. Skeptics advocate for clear reporting
on AI tools' construction and bias mitigation. Some candidates are
using AI to formulate responses, highlighting the evolving competition
between AI systems and job applicants. 

 WHY BIG TECH WANTS TO MAKE AI COST NOTHING (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Meta has open-sourced Llama 3.1, an LLM rivaling OpenAI's ChatGPT,
allowing almost all companies to incorporate it freely. This strategy
may commoditize LLMs and drive demand for corresponding complements
like server space. As big tech releases similar models, AI startups
might face challenges, with industry giants potentially outpacing
smaller competitors in AI advancements.
