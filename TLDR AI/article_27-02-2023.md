HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

PLANNING FOR AGI AND BEYOND (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI outlines steps they have taken and plan to take in their
ultimate goal to create AGI. They outline a fairly ambitious future
and explain that future releases of these models might be slower and
more cautious. They hint that they believe ChatGPT to be a stepping
stone towards AGI. Examples of efforts they have undertaken are
included in the article. 

META RELEASES LLAMA, A STATE-OF-THE-ART FOUNDATIONAL LARGE LANGUAGE
MODEL (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


Meta has publicly released a new large language model called LLaMA,
which is designed to help researchers advance their work in the AI
subfield of natural language processing (NLP). LLaMA is available in
various sizes and is a foundational model that can be fine-tuned for
different tasks. By releasing LLaMA, Meta hopes to democratize access
to large language models, allowing more researchers to study and test
new approaches in this field. 

UIZARD AUTODESIGNER: TEXT TO DESIGN, AUTOMATED BY AI (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://uizard.io/autodesigner/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Autodesigner is the latest AI design feature from Uizard that enables
users to generate multi screen mockups by typing out project ideas in
plain English. Autodesigner is pretty much like ChatGPT but for UI/UX
design! Joining Uizard's library of AI-powered features, Autodesigner
will help bring your vision to life in seconds; simply enter a few
simple phrases and let AI bring your app vision to life in a matter of
seconds.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ALIGNING TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS USING HUMAN FEEDBACK (34 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12192?utm_source=tldrai] 

In this work we see additional evidence that alignment improves
capabilities. Previous research seems to have mostly been focused on
capabilities that are weakly aligned to human preference (e.g.,
improving FID or SOTA on a benchmark). Now, however, we find that if
we train a reward model on human feedback data, our models become
significantly more useful. They outline a ‚Äúreward weighted
likelihood maximization‚Äù scheme. Their experiments are constrained
to categories of count, color, and background. 

NEW ‚ÄúOPEN‚Äù FOUNDATION MODELS FROM META (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/?utm_source=tldrai]


Meta has trained 4 powerful language models on a Trillion tokens. They
find that many of the modern advances such as pre-layernorm, SwiGLU,
and Rotary embeddings improve their model‚Äôs performance.
Additionally, they outline the training mix and compute power used to
train these models. They used 2048 A100 GPUs for 5 months over the
course of this project, with the largest model taking 21 days to train
on their whole cluster.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

CIVITAI (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/civitai/civitai?utm_source=tldrai] 

The goal of Civitai is to create a platform where people can share
their stable diffusion models (textual inversions, hypernetworks,
aesthetic gradients, VAEs, and any other crazy stuff people do to
customize their AI generations), collaborate with others to improve
them, and learn from each other's work. The platform allows users to
create an account, upload their models, and browse models that have
been shared by others. Users can also leave comments and feedback on
each other's models to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing.


COMPOSER: A LARGE CONTROLLABLE DIFFUSION MODEL FOR INFINITE IMAGE
GENERATION AND MANIPULATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/damo-vilab/composer?utm_source=tldrai] 

Composer is a large (5 billion parameters) controllable diffusion
model trained on billions of (text, image) pairs. It can exponentially
expand the control space through composition, leading to an enormous
number of ways to generate and manipulate images, i.e., making the
infinite use of finite means. 

EXPANDING THE CAPABILITIES OF DIFFUSION MODELS FOR CROSS-DOMAIN
COMPOSITING TASKS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/cross-domain-compositing/cross-domain-compositing?utm_source=tldrai]


The paper discusses how off-the-shelf diffusion models can be used for
various cross-domain compositing tasks, such as image blending, object
immersion, texture replacement, and CG2Real translation or
stylization. The proposed method uses a localized, iterative
refinement scheme that infuses the inserted objects with contextual
information from the background scene, providing control over the
types and degrees of change.

BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY CHIEFS QUESTION CHATGPT‚ÄôS READINESS FOR THE
ENTERPRISE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/ZwVMu?utm_source=tldrai] 

The generative AI chatbot can be spectacularly wrong, executives say,
and is mostly good for rote tasks at present. Nonetheless, they say
CIOs who fail to explore the technology‚Äôs possibility risk their
companies falling behind. 

EVERYDAY ROBOTICS LAYOFFS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-layoffs-hit-trash-sorting-robots/?utm_source=tldrai]


Another unfortunate casualty from recent layoffs, everyday robotics
which developed industry leading cleaning and trash sorting robots is
disbanded. One of the ‚Äúother bets‚Äù that lost $6B last year,
Everyday Robotics was a graduate from Alphabet‚Äôs X ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù
program. Some of the research will be continued inside of Google
robotics.

AI text-to-image generator Midjourney has temporarily banned words
related to the reproductive system in an effort to stop users from
creating porn.
