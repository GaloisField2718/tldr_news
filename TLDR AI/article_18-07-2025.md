HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT AGENT: BRIDGING RESEARCH AND ACTION (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 ChatGPT Agent combines Operator's web browsing with Deep Research's
analysis capabilities, using its own virtual computer to handle
multi-step tasks like calendar management, competitive analysis, and
slideshow creation. 

 ANTHROPIC TIGHTENS USAGE LIMITS FOR CLAUDE CODE – WITHOUT TELLING
USERS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Claude Code users have been hit with unexpectedly restrictive usage
limits since Monday morning, particularly among heavy users of the
service. There was no announcement about any change in limits, so many
users have concluded that their subscription was downgraded or their
usage is being inaccurately tracked. Anthropic has acknowledged the
issue but declined to elaborate further. Anthropic's pricing system
sets tiered limits without ever guaranteeing a set level of access,
leaving users unable to plan around usage limits.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SHOPIFY'S INTERNAL AI ADOPTION STRATEGY: UNLIMITED SPEND AND "MCP
EVERYTHING" (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Shopify bought 3,000 Cursor licenses with unlimited token spending
after getting legal teams to default to "yes" on AI tools, then built
an internal LLM proxy with MCPs connecting every data source.
Non-technical sales reps now build performance auditing tools in
Cursor, while a sales engineer runs his entire workflow through a
dashboard that pulls real-time context from Salesforce, Slack, and
GSuite without opening those apps. 

 HIDDEN TECHNICAL DEBT IN AI (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI systems, including LLMs, require extensive infrastructure, data
management, and operational complexity, contrary to their initial
promise of simplicity. To manage costs and complexity, deterministic
software and ML models become necessary for tasks like tool selection
and system monitoring. This parallels earlier ML systems, revealing
hidden technical debt and the complexity beneath the "AI magic box." 

 HOW TO EVALUATE AI AGENTS TO PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS (14 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Hugging Face's FutureBench is a benchmark for testing AI agents on
their ability to predict future events across domains like science,
geopolitics, and technology.

 THE AI CLOUD: A UNIFIED PLATFORM FOR AI WORKLOADS (11 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Vercel has launched the AI Cloud, a platform designed to simplify AI
app development by integrating AI-first tools like AI SDK and AI
Gateway for flexible and secure execution. Fluid compute optimizes AI
workloads by managing idle times and bursts efficiently, reducing
costs significantly. The platform also introduces Vercel BotID for
securing critical routes and Vercel Sandbox for safely running
untrusted code, driving the shift into the agentic era of web
development. 

 SCALING CONTEXT REQUIRES RETHINKING ATTENTION (29 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new implementation of attention (“Power” attention) allows
independent control of state size through a hyperparameter p, solving
the challenge of balancing computational costs for long-context
training. This mechanism outperforms standard attention on long
sequences and allows custom GPU kernels that are 8.6x faster than
Flash Attention at 64k context. 

 THE WEIGHTED PERPLEXITY BENCHMARK: TOKENIZER-NORMALIZED EVALUATION
FOR LANGUAGE MODEL COMPARISON (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Weighted Perplexity Benchmark offers a tokenizer-normalized
evaluation method to compare language models effectively. It adjusts
perplexity scores, considering differences in tokenization, to provide
a fairer comparison across models. This approach enhances the accuracy
of assessing NLP performance.

 PERPLEXITY SEES INDIA AS A SHORTCUT IN ITS RACE AGAINST OPENAI (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Perplexity is quietly expanding into India to compete in the next
phase of AI adoption. It is rapidly adding millions of users in the
world's second-largest internet and smartphone market. Perplexity has
partnered with Airtel, India's second-largest telecom operator, to
offer a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription to all 360 million
subscribers. While the company has seen major growth in the country,
monetizing its large user base remains a challenge. 

 META HAS POACHED TWO MORE HEAVYWEIGHTS FROM APPLE'S AI TEAM (1 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Meta has acquired Mark Lee and Tom Gunter from the Apple Foundation
Models team. Lee was Ruoming Pang's first hire at Apple, and Gunter
was a distinguished engineer at Apple with an eight-year tenure. Meta
recently poached Pang with a $200 million sign-on bonus. The company
has been on an aggressive hiring spree, pulling top AI talent from
across the industry.
