ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HIGH-PERFORMANCE AI NEEDS HIGH-PERFORMANCE STORAGE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If you're running data-intensive AI and ML workloads, you can't
compromise on performance. Sycomp Storage Fueled by IBM Storage Scale
[11] is a high-performance, software-defined storage system that works
across clouds and on-premises. It delivers >500 GB/s read speeds,
auto-tiers data to reduce costs, and is quick to deploy. Learn more

 TENCENT HUNYUAN3D-1.0: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR TEXT-TO-3D AND
IMAGE-TO-3D GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Hunyuan3D-1.0 is a strong new generative 3D model with powerful
multi-view synthesis capabilities. The output models still aren't
production ready, but they are a great starting point for artists
looking to generate assets. 

 ANDROID LAB (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Benchmark for autonomous agents on the Android mobile operating
system. 

 AI'S SOCIAL SKILLS TO HELP HUMANS (6 MINUTE READ) [14]

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW THE NEW YORK TIMES IS USING GENERATIVE AI AS A REPORTING TOOL (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 New York Times reporters used AI tools, particularly LLMs, to
transcribe and analyze over 400 hours of audio for an investigation.
Automated transcription significantly sped up the process, with LLMs
identifying key themes and topics with improved accuracy. Human
reporters were used to ensure the accurate interpretation and
contextual understanding of the data, showing the importance of
human-AI collaboration. 

 WRITING AS A WAY OF THINKING (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article discusses the impact of AI on writing and thinking,
questioning the notion that writing is the only form of thinking. AI,
such as ChatGPT, can enhance thinking through conversation. AI tools
can augment rather than eliminate various thought processes. AI will
change writing by automating mundane aspects, allowing for more
creative and thought-provoking content. 

 WAYMO EXPLORES USING GOOGLE'S GEMINI TO TRAIN ITS ROBOTAXIS (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Waymo is leveraging Google's MLLM Gemini to develop an end-to-end
multimodal model for autonomous driving called EMMA. The project aims
to enhance decision-making in the company's robotaxis. EMMA will
integrate sensor data for better trajectory prediction and object
detection, indicating a shift towards using LLMs beyond common
applications. Further research is required to refine and scale these
models for autonomous driving tasks.
