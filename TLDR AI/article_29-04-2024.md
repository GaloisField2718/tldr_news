 THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH IN E-COMMERCE (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 The Adevinta team spent the last six months building an LLM-powered
search tool [4] for their French marketplace. They've summarized their
learnings into a new blog post that covers:

	* An overview and reference architecture [4] of the developed system
	* Details of the LLM interaction - models used, system prompts, fine
tuning, [4] and more
	* Inferring a user's intended product category to refine search
results

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LET'S THINK DOT BY DOT (23 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper shows that chain-of-thought (CoT) thinking can be
obfuscated with ‚Äò...' tokens. This requires training the model but
shows that interpreting the CoT steps may not be possible and thinking
can be hidden by the model. 

 VIDEO-LANGUAGE MODELS WITH PLLAVA (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have introduced a new model called PLLaVA, which stands
out by adapting image-language AI models for video tasks using a
unique pooling strategy. 

 TRACKGPT: OBJECT TRACKING WITH INSTRUCTION-BASED TECHNIQUE (15 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 TrackGPT integrates Large Vision-Language Model capabilities to
transform object tracking. It understands implicit instructions for
