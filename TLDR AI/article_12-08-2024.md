HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 UBER HIGHLIGHTS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE EFFORTS NOW THAT TESLA'S IN ITS
REARVIEW MIRROR (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Uber's Q2 results emphasized its growing AV segment, highlighting a
6x rise in autonomous trips year-over-year and partnerships with AV
leaders like Waymo and Alphabet. CEO Khosrowshahi expressed confidence
in Uber's global AV acquisition strategy, distancing from a
winner-take-all approach. The presentation also hinted at future AV
developments, including a collaboration with BYD on autonomous-capable
EVs. 

 MISTRAL: BUILD, TWEAK, REPEAT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 La Plateforme introduces customizations for LLMs, including Mistral
Large 2 and Codestral, offering developers the ability to fine-tune
models with specific domain knowledge. An alpha release of 'Agents'
provides layered, complex workflows integrated with Mistral Large 2
capabilities. Mistralai SDK has hit a stable 1.0 release for Python
and Typescript, improving usability and consistency. 

 ZICO KOLTER JOINS OPENAI'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Zico Kolter, a Professor at Carnegie Mellon University and expert in

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TREE ATTENTION (28 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This is an extension of Ring Attention, which allows for extremely
long context by scaling across multiple GPUs. The researchers derive
an energy function to inform how models should be sharded. 

 REDUCING BIAS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bias-aware low-rank adaptation (BA-LoRA) is a new technique for
fine-tuning LLMs that addresses bias propagation from pre-training
data. 

 TEMPORAL EVENT FORECASTING WITH MULTIMODAL LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers explore the potential of images in improving temporal
event forecasting using LLMs. Their proposed framework, MM-Forecast,
identifies two crucial roles of images ‚Äî highlighting and
complementing textual data.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SQLITE-VEC (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A vector database built on top of the powerful SQLite technology. It
can handle millions of queries and has a nice API for vectors. 

 PUFFERLIB (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PufferLib is a wrapper and accelerator for reinforcement learning
libraries to unify the interface. It is extremely fast and contains a
number of useful baselines. 

 LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Trans-tokenization is a cross-lingual strategy that enhances language
models for low and mid-resource languages by leveraging high-resource
language data.

MISCELLANEOUS

 DON'T PIVOT INTO AI RESEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Scale has become the predominant driver of performance in the field
of AI and machine learning. The substantial capital required has led
to market consolidation, with only a few suppliers capable of
employing productive ML researchers. This dynamic mirrors the
historical consolidation seen in chip design, suggesting a future
downturn in the prestige and salaries for ML roles as supply outstrips
demand. Aspiring ML professionals should carefully assess their career
motivations in light of these industry trends. 

 SONOVA'S AI HEARING AIDS OFFER CRYSTAL-CLEAR SPEECH IN NOISY PLACES
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sonova has introduced Phonak Aud√©o Sphere, a hearing aid featuring
AI and dual-chip technology that promises a 53x boost in speech
understanding in noisy environments. Developed over years, the
platform combats the key challenge for hearing aid users ‚Äî clarity
in noise ‚Äî using the DEEPSONIC chip with advanced DNN capabilities.
With this leap in tech, Sonova aims to significantly improve the
quality of life for the hearing impaired. 

 APPLE INTELLIGENCE MAY COME TO EU AFTER ALL (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apple's AI features in the upcoming macOS Sequoia will be available
for Mac users in the EU, unlike on iOS and iPadOS 18, per the latest
beta release notes. The EU exclusion, which is due to Digital Markets
Act compliance issues, does not apply to Macs. Mac users will likely
be able to access Apple Intelligence if they set their system to U.S.
English.
