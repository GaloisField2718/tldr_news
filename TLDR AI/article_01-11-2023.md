HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ISOMORPHIC TEASES THE NEXT VERSION OF ALPHAFOLD (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AlphaFold is an amazing model for science. The new work by Isomorphic
Labs (a spin off from Google) extends it beyond just proteins and
improves overall performance. 

 ARTISTS LOSE FIRST ROUND OF COPYRIGHT CASE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A federal judge dismissed most claims in a landmark lawsuit where
artists accused generative AI art generators of unauthorized image
use, pinpointing deficiencies in copyright infringement accusations
against Midjourney and DeviantArt. 

 OPENAI'S ILYA SUTSKEVER ON PREVENTING ROGUE SUPERINTELLIGENCE (15
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has shifted
his focus from building the next model like GPT to figuring out how to
avoid future artificial superintelligence from behaving undesirably.
He believes the reality of AI surpassing human intelligence is
imminent and anticipates technologies that will allow humans and AI to
merge. Sutskever and his team at OpenAI are actively working on
"superalignment", a set of procedures to control future AI technology.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMPROVING THE RELIABILITY OF DIFFUSION MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have found ways to use diffusion models to make long-term
plans, but these plans aren't always realistic or safe. This study
introduces a method to fix those unreliable plans, using a tool called
the "restoration gap". 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO MEDICAL VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING (22 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The study assesses how well GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) answers
questions related to medical images from various sources, such as
X-rays and CT scans. 

 A MASK PROPAGATION TECHNIQUE FOR VIDEO SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION (19
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The study introduces MPVSS, a method for segmenting video content
that reduces computational load by focusing on key frames and then
predicting masks for other frames based on these key ones. 

üßë‚Äçüíª 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EFFICIENT VIDEO UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This project introduces TESTA, a method designed to speed up the
process of understanding long videos by combining similar frames and
patches. Using TESTA, researchers managed to greatly reduce the
computational load and improve performance in matching paragraphs to
videos and answering questions about long videos. 

 IMPROVING MULTI-MODAL LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Researchers dived deep into the visual encoders used in Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and discovered that certain features
from CLIP and DINO models are especially effective for detailed visual
tasks. They then introduced COMM, a strategy that combines the
strengths of both models. 

 A NEW IMAGE DENOISING APPROACH (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The study introduces PUCA, a new self-supervised denoising approach
that maintains J-invariance, a critical aspect for effective
denoising.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HACKERS ARE WEAPONIZING AI TO IMPROVE PHISHING (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI is poised to dramatically improve the success of phishing attacks,
which is already used in 90% of cyberattacks. 

 SEISMIC WAVES OF GEN Z BEHAVIOR (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article discusses the influence of Gen Z on various industries
and how their behavior is causing seismic waves in the market. The
author emphasizes the importance of understanding Gen Z's habits,
preferences, and values, as this generation drives significant changes
in consumer behavior. By examining the social, technological, and
economic aspects of Gen Z's lives, businesses can better anticipate
their needs and adapt their offerings to cater to this influential
demographic. 

 DEATH OF A FLYWHEEL (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Death of a Flywheel discusses the decline of business flywheels,
which represent self-sustaining momentum that drives company growth,
due to factors including market saturation, evolving customer
preferences, competitive threats, regulatory changes, and misaligned
incentives. The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing and
addressing these threats to ensure the continued health of a company's
flywheel.
