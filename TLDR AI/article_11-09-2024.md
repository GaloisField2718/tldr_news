HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-FABRICATED SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ON GOOGLE SCHOLAR (20 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are increasingly producing
fraudulent research papers, infiltrating databases like Google Scholar
alongside legitimate studies. These papers, often on controversial
topics like health and the environment, pose significant risks to
scientific integrity and public trust. Enhanced vigilance and more
robust filtering in academic search engines are essential to curb this
growing issue. 

 APPLE ANNOUNCES ITS NEW A18 AND A18 PRO IPHONE CHIPS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Apple unveiled the A18 and A18 Pro chips at its ‚ÄúGlowtime‚Äù event,
promising significant CPU and GPU improvements over the A16 Bionic.
The A18 Pro boasts enhanced memory bandwidth and upgraded
image-processing capabilities. Both chips support advanced AI
features, with the A18 Pro notably improving on-device model
performance and thermal design for better gaming experiences. 

 AMD ANNOUNCES UNIFIED UDNA GPU ARCHITECTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AMD announced at IFA 2024 that it will unify its RDNA and CDNA
architectures into a combined UDNA microarchitecture, aiming to better
compete with Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem. This strategic move seeks to
streamline development and bolster AMD's position in AI and HPC
markets. The transition to UDNA is a pivotal step, with full-scale
implementation expected beyond the upcoming RDNA 4 generation.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CAN LLMS GENERATE NOVEL RESEARCH IDEAS? (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This longitudinal study assessed 100 NLP researchers' abilities to
write novel ideas and then review those ideas. It found that LLMs can
generate more novel ideas, but these ideas were slightly less feasible
than the ones produced by human research scientists. 

 SUPERHUMAN AUTOMATED FORECASTING (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Safe AI Institute has released research on a system that can
outperform human experts at forecasting. 

 ADEMAMIX OPTIMIZER (32 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper from Apple proposes an alternative to traditional
exponential moving average optimization that uses contributions from
older gradients to dramatically improve learning convergence.

 üìÉ¬†GENAI IS HELPING BUSINESSES WIN THE WAR AGAINST UNSTRUCTURED
DATA (SPONSOR) [11] 

 For data-intensive business, the most exciting use case for GenAI
isn't chatbots: it's taking unstructured sources‚Äî PDFs, images,
emails, audio, video‚Äîand turning them into structured and actionable
data. Join the webinar [11] to see how Restructured, an AI-powered
data platform, allows anyone to wrangle insights from the messiest of
data. Save your spot! [11] 

 OPTIMIZING INFERENCE PROXIES FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Optillm helps to optimize prompts based on a number of proven
research algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search, Z3 solvers, and Self
Consistency. 

 3D SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Researchers addressed the challenge of source-free unsupervised
domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation by introducing
regularization techniques and a novel criterion. 

 MEMORY-EFFICIENT OPTICAL FLOW (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 HCVFlow is a new memory-efficient optical flow method that tackles
the high computational cost of all-pairs cost volumes in
high-resolution images.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CONCEPT SLIDERS (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Concept Sliders are a powerful way to control the output of diffusion
models. Work has been done to make them work with the new Flux suite
of models. 

 MINIFYING HTML FOR GPT-4O: REMOVE ALL THE HTML TAGS (6 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Stripping HTML to plain text reduces costs with minimal performance
loss in GPT-4o for data extraction tasks. Tests on the Mercury Prize
dataset showed that GPT-4o performs well without HTML structure and
that GPT-4o mini is a cost-effective choice for unstructured
questions. For structured extraction tasks, consider testing both
versions to balance cost and accuracy. 

 WAYMO GIVING 100,000 ROBOTAXI RIDES PER WEEK BUT NOT MAKING ANY MONEY
(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Waymo is providing over 100,000 paid autonomous rides weekly in San
Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, doubling its May numbers. Despite
its growth, Waymo remains unprofitable, with Google's experimental
division incurring a $2 billion operating loss. High costs for
vehicles and city mapping, combined with public hesitancy, continue to
challenge its path to profitability.
