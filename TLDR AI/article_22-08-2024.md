HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 IDEOGRAM 2.0 (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ideogram has launched a new model which has superior text rendering
and image generation capabilities. 

 INTRODUCING ZED (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Zed AI is a hosted service that integrates AI-powered coding into the
Zed text editor, letting developers use LLMs while maintaining full
control over their code. Zed has partnered with Anthropic to allow
fast editing with Claude. 

 NVIDIA'S AI NPCS WILL DEBUT IN A MULTIPLAYER MECH BATTLE GAME NEXT
YEAR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia's AI system ACE will power in-game character interactions in
Mecha Break, a mech battle game launching in 2025. It uses GPT-4o and
a mix of on-device and cloud-based AI for natural language processing
and vocal generation. Initial demonstrations reveal lackluster NPC
engagement, with concerns over response delays and uninspiring
dialogue.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TRANSFUSION (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazing new model from Meta that does both next token prediction and
diffusion on interleaved text and images. It matches benchmark
performance on text and images with previous generation models like
Dalle 2 and Llama 2. 

 TO CODE OR NOT TO CODE (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It is an industry secret that pretraining models on code helps them
generalize in other tasks that require reasoning. This paper from
Cohere thoroughly studies that problem and confirms that code is
broadly useful as a building block of reasoning. 

 10X-70X SPEEDUP IN OPTICAL FLOW ESTIMATION (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a new optical flow estimation method that
achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing computational
costs.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AI IS ABOUT TO DISRUPT‚Ä¶ ICE CREAM? (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Advancements in AI and robotics open a new horizon for the $81.8BN
ice cream industry. Dice Cream [10] is building the world's first
autonomous ice cream parlor [10] - serving 144 combinations of ice
cream at nearly 1 scoop per second. If you act quickly, you can get an
equity stake [10] in Dice Cream at the current valuation. 

 TORCHPRUNING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Repository of state-of-the-art methods for pruning language models
that is well maintained with many supported algorithms. 

 MISINFORMATION DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Researchers have introduced a new approach to detecting visual
misinformation that focuses on the original meta-context of images, a
crucial aspect often overlooked in automated methods. 

 PATHOLOGY IMAGE UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PA-LLaVA is a domain-specific language-vision assistant designed for
pathology image analysis.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PHI 3.5 FAMILY (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An in-depth read into the new Phi 3.5 models recently launched by
Microsoft, including the MoE and vision model. 

 THE TOP 100 GEN AI CONSUMER APPS - 3RD EDITION (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Andreessen Horowitz's latest consumer AI report ranks the top 100
generative AI apps, dividing them into the top 50 AI web products and
the top 50 AI mobile apps based on consumer patterns of engagement.
The report provides detailed insights into emerging categories, new
industry challengers, and trends. 

 THESE 'LIVING COMPUTERS' ARE MADE FROM HUMAN NEURONS AND YOU CAN RENT
ONE FOR $500 A MONTH (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 FinalSpark's "Neuroplatform" integrates human-brain organoids into
computing, offering a rentable biocomputing platform aimed at reducing
AI's energy usage. Challenges include standardizing production and
extending organoid lifespan beyond 100 days. Alternatives like
cellular computing and fungal networks are also explored for tasks
beyond silicon-based systems' capabilities.

 SEVEN BASIC RULES FOR CAUSAL INFERENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This detailed blog post presents seven fundamental rules of causal
inference that encompass the relationship between causal mechanisms
and observed correlations, explained via causal graphs, logic terms,
and R code simulations. 

 MARKOV CHAINS ARE FUNNIER THAN LLMS (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article discusses the predictability of LLMs and their
limitations in creating humor, arguing that while LLMs excel in
generating contextually appropriate text, their predictive nature
makes them ill-suited for comedic writing, which relies on
unexpectedness. 

 AI AT WORK IS HERE. NOW COMES THE HARD PART (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Global use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the past six
months, with 75% of knowledge workers now utilizing it.
