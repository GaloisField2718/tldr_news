 BUILDING AN AI CODE REVIEWER GROUNDED IN PRODUCTION TELEMETRY
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If AI code reviewers are supposed to save time, why am I triaging 40
comments about trailing whitespace, "consider using an f-string," and
"line exceeds 100 characters" on a 10-line change?

In this technical deep dive [4], Sentry breaks down how it built an AI
code reviewer that uses production telemetry to predict actual errors
— not just static style feedback. If you want to understand the
architecture, pipeline, and filtering logic [4] Sentry built, this is
for you.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GMAIL IS ENTERING THE GEMINI ERA (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Gmail is adding AI Overviews using Gemini technology, summarizing
email threads and allowing users to query their inbox with natural
language. Its new features, Help Me Write, Suggested Replies, and
Proofread, improve email drafting, while AI Inbox filters prioritize
key messages. These updates, available for free, are rolling out now
in the US. 

 OPENAI TO ACQUIRE THE TEAM BEHIND EXECUTIVE COACHING AI TOOL CONVOGO
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software
platform that automates and improves leadership assessments and
feedback reporting. The startup will not acquire Convogo's IP or
technology. Convogo's team will join OpenAI to work on its AI cloud
efforts. Its product will be wound down.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 LORD OF WAR, MEET LORD OF TOKENS: TORTURE-TESTING IMAGE MODELS ON
DESIGN-AGENCY GRADE WORK (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The poster for 'Lord of War', which depicts an image of Nicholas Cage
comprised of bullets, is a masterclass in compositing. A team of
designers likely had to manually source images of bullets, match the
lighting of the individual bullets with the shadows on the face, and
arrange thousands of shell casings to form a recognizable human face.
That level of skill was rare in 2005. This article explores whether AI
can redesign a similar 'Lord of Tokens' image with GPU dies and
silicon wafers constituting Jensen Huang's face. 

 CONTEXT PERSONALIZATION (34 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post demonstrates how to implement long-term memory and stateful
personalization in AI agents using OpenAI's Agents SDK. Structured
memory objects and context-injection patterns enable agents to recall
preferences, consolidate user notes, and evolve over time. 

 EIGHT SOFTWARE MARKETS AI THAT WILL TRANSFORM DIFFERENTLY (20 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Increased efficiency in resource use can lead to higher total
consumption, but only when demand is elastic. Cheaper production just
changes who captures the surplus when demand is constrained by
something other than production cost. AI coding will change how things
are built without changing how much gets built or at what quality for
a huge amount of economically significant software. This post looks at
eight markets to see what impact AI coding will have.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 94% OF AI LEADERS DON'T BELIEVE THEIR DATA INFRASTRUCTURE IS READY
FOR AI (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Why is AI stuck in pilot mode? It's constrained by data
infrastructure and enterprise context. CData surveyed 200+ data & AI
experts [10] on what's working (and breaking) in AI data connectivity.
The key finding? IF YOUR DATA ISN'T LIVE, CONTEXTUAL, AND
GOVERNED, YOUR AI WON'T DELIVER. Read the 2026 State of AI Data
Connectivity Report. [10] 

 WARP SPECIALIZATION IN TRITON: DESIGN AND ROADMAP (20 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Warp specialization is a popular technique that improves kernel
performance on GPUs out of the box. The key idea is to have
specialized code paths for each warp instead of the same code. This
reduces performance hits due to control flow divergence, improves
latency hiding, and makes better use of hardware units on the GPU.
This post outlines the current design of warp specialization in
Triton, a compiler that aims to generate performance-portable code and
runtime across hardware for AI kernels. 

 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO BUILDING AGENTS WITH THE CLAUDE AGENT SDK (22
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This guide walks readers through the process of building a code
review agent from scratch that can read files, run commands, edit
code, and figure out the steps to accomplish a task. The resulting
agent can analyze a code base, find bugs and security issues, and
return structured feedback. The guide aims to help readers understand
how the Claude Code SDK works so they can build whatever they actually
need. 

 SCALE AI'S AGENTIC RUBRICS FOR SOFTWARE AGENT VERIFICATION (28 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Agentic Rubrics enable test-free verification of code changes by
creating checklist-style evaluations from expert agents that interact
with codebases. They outperform baseline methods on SWE-Bench Verified
and offer a scalable, interpretable signal for reinforcement learning
and inference-time feedback.

 AI ISN'T “JUST PREDICTING THE NEXT WORD” ANYMORE (23 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Modern AI systems have evolved past simply predicting the next word
and now demonstrate enhanced capabilities, such as solving complex
problems and reasoning. Systems like OpenAI and Google DeepMind have
achieved impressive feats, including outperforming top mathematicians
in competitions, reflecting significant advancements in cognitive
tasks beyond autocomplete. 

 AMONG THE AGENTS (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Coding agents like Gemini 3 Pro and Claude Opus 4.5 have automated
tasks ranging from invoice creation to predicting US corn yields.
These agents exhibit capabilities close to artificial general
intelligence but require human understanding and oversight to avoid
errors and maximize their potential. The rise of these tools signals a
shift towards enabling individuals to independently explore complex
software projects. They demonstrate the importance of foundational
technical knowledge and creating opportunities and challenges for both
new and incumbent firms.
