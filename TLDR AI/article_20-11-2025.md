 YOUR AI CODE REVIEWER DOESN'T KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY BREAKS. SENTRY'S
DOES. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Generic AI code review catches typos, style issues, and things that
_might_ be a problem. Sentry's AI code reviewer (AKA Seer) [4] knows
exactly which changes will cause issues based on what's broken before,
in your actual environment.

Like most things AI, the secret is better context...

→ Sentry already monitors your production errors and performance.

→ Seer AI Code Review uses Sentry's data + your code + commit
history to review your PRs.

→ Seer can even auto-generate unit tests for your PRs [4]. Because
tested code breaks less!

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 BUILDING MORE WITH GPT-5.1-CODEX-MAX (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GPT-5.1-Codex-Max is trained to operate across multiple context
windows through "compaction", allowing it to work over millions of
tokens and complete tasks spanning 24+ hours. The model achieves 77.9%
on SWE-bench Verified while using 30% fewer thinking tokens than its
predecessor. 

 ELON MUSK'S XAI IS IN ADVANCED TALKS TO RAISE $15 BILLION, LIFTING
VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 xAI is in advanced talks to raise $15 billion in new equity at a $230
billion valuation. The startup has raised billions of dollars to
compete with OpenAI and expand the capabilities of its chatbot, Grok.
The startup recently lost several senior executives. It was previously
valued at $113 billion in March after it acquired social media site X.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GOOGLE HAS YOUR DATA. GEMINI BARELY USES IT (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google is dramatically under-capitalizing on the strongest context
position in the industry. Gemini hides its workspace connector in its
settings, treating it as an optional enhancement, not the center of
the product. This is almost certainly because Google is trying to play
it safe. The company has an opportunity to turn its dormant context
advantage into experiences that would be impossible anywhere else. 

 MY GPT-5.1 PRO REVIEW (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GPT-5.1 Pro is a slow, heavy-weight reasoning model that feels
intelligent and can handle tough problems. It follows instructions
well without going off the rails, making it feel like a contract
engineer working from a spec rather than an assistant. Its biggest
weakness is its interface, as is lives in ChatGPT, not in the IDE.
Gemini 3 is still better for most day-to-day work. However,
GPT-5.1-Pro wins in deep thought, planning, and research. 

 HOW EVALS DRIVE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN AI FOR BUSINESSES (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 OpenAI published a framework arguing that evaluation systems
("evals") are bridge between AI's probabilistic nature and business
outcomes that breakdown into three phases: 1) experts defining
success, 2) stress-test systems with real-world edge cases, and 3)
continuous monitoring to build proprietary datasets that compound into
competitive moats. 

 GEMINI 3 PROMPTING: BEST PRACTICES FOR GENERAL USAGE (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Gemini 3 Pro responds best to direct, structured prompts with
behavioral constraints placed at the top rather than scattered
throughout. Unlike previous versions, it defaults to concise responses
unless explicitly asked to be conversational. The model handles long
contexts better when instructions appear after data rather than before
and treats multimodal inputs as equal-class data requiring explicit
cross-modal instructions. It benefits from explicit planning steps
with self-critique loops using XML or Markdown formatting.

 THERE'S A HIDDEN PRODUCTIVITY CRISIS IN IT - AND AI MIGHT ME MAKING
IT WORSE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Miro's new _Momentum at Work_ [11] report shows 69% of IT leaders
report workflow disruption from employees toggling between core tools
and AI apps. Worse: 33% see AI actually increasing organizational
silos. Get the full report [11] or read key takeways and insights from
IT leaders at GitHub, AWS, and Red Hat on the Miro blog. [12] 

 SCIENTIFIC ML IN PYTORCH (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 PINA, a new open-source library for Scientific Machine Learning, is
now part of the PyTorch ecosystem. It offers a modular, scalable
workflow for modeling scientific systems, including PDE solvers and
physical simulations. 

 META OPEN-SOURCES SAM 3 FOR SMARTER SEGMENTATION (15 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Meta open-sourced SAM 3 with major updates to its segmentation model,
including support for text and visual prompts. It can now track and
segment objects across video, enabling more flexible media workflows. 

 THE SECRET BEHIND GEMINI 3 (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The secret behind Gemini 3 is improved pre-training and post
training. The pre-training team delivered a massive jump using
scaling. Post-training is still a total greenfield. There is a lot of
room for algorithm progress and improvement.

 “WE'RE IN AN LLM BUBBLE,” HUGGING FACE CEO SAYS—BUT NOT AN AI
ONE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, says that the LLM bubble may be
bursting next year. However, that doesn't mean that 'AI' will collapse
- LLMs are just a subset of AI technology. We are still at the very
beginning of AI, and we'll see much more in the next few years. It is
more likely that we will end up with a multitude of models that can
solve many different problems rather than one type of model that will
solve all problems for all companies. 

 ALPHAXIV RAISES $7M IN FUNDING TO BECOME THE GITHUB OF AI RESEARCH (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 alphaXiv has raised $7 million in seed funding in a round co-led by
Menlo Ventures and Haystack. The startup aims to help engineers
transform the latest academic discoveries into cutting-edge AI
features by streamlining their paths from research to production. Its
platform allows researchers to publish their latest papers, connecting
them to engineers who use the knowledge to create new AI features.
alphaXiv aims to become the de facto global workspace for AI
researchers.
