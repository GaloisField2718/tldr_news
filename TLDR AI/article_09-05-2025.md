HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL MEDIUM 3 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mistral Medium 3 was introduced to deliver strong enterprise
performance at significantly lower cost. It is optimized for
deployment flexibility and coding tasks. 

 FIDJI SIMO JOINS OPENAI AS CEO OF APPLICATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has appointed Fidji Simo to lead its Applications division,
reinforcing its focus on scaling product and operations as it expands
beyond research into global deployment and infrastructure. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES WEB SEARCH API FOR CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic launched a new Web Search API for its Claude models. This
API allows Claude to access and use real-time information from the
web. The capability enhances Claude's ability to provide current and
accurate responses.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 IS THERE A HALF-LIFE FOR THE SUCCESS RATES OF AI AGENTS? (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 AI performance on long tasks follows a simple model with a constant
failure rate, creating an exponential decline in success. Each AI
agent can be characterized by a "half-life" that estimates success
over varying task lengths. This model suggests failures arise from
complex sets of subtasks. 

 SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION: HERE'S HOW AI IS TRANSFORMING
CYBERCRIME (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI in cybersecurity primarily enhances existing techniques rather
than creating new threats and lowers entry barriers for
cybercriminals. At the recent RSA Conference, experts highlighted AI's
role in automating tasks and facilitating advanced cybercrime models
like AI-as-a-Service. Future defenses will require AI-driven
strategies and international collaboration to effectively combat
evolving threats. 

 THE LEADERBOARD ILLUSION (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Chatbot Arena's benchmarking exhibits bias due to undisclosed private
testing and selective data access. Providers like Google and OpenAI
dominate data access, while open-source models receive significantly
less. These dynamics lead to overfitting rather than genuine model
improvement.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 OSMOSIS SELF-IMPROVEMENT VIA REAL-TIME REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Osmosis is a platform for AI self-improvement via real-time
reinforcement learning. The team has open sourced a lightweight model
that works as well as SOTA for MCP. It can be run locally. 

 ACTOR-CRITIC LEARNING WITH OFFLINE DATA (29 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new actor-critic RL algorithm has achieved near-optimal sample
efficiency using offline data and targeted exploration, addressing
long-standing challenges in hybrid RL settings. 

 AMIE GAINS VISION: A RESEARCH AI AGENT FOR MULTIMODAL DIAGNOSTIC
DIALOGUE (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google Research and DeepMind collaborated on this research, with
contributions from many experts across various teams.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES 'IMPLICIT CACHING' TO MAKE ACCESSING ITS LATEST AI
MODELS CHEAPER (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's new "implicit caching" feature in its Gemini API reportedly
offers 75% cost savings on repetitive context for its Gemini 2.5
models. Unlike the previous manual explicit caching method, this
automatic feature could ease developer concerns about unexpected API
costs. However, developers should monitor its effectiveness, as Google
hasn't provided third-party verification for the cost savings claims. 

 AI-GENERATED CODE COULD BE A DISASTER FOR THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN.
HERE'S WHY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI-generated code often includes non-existent library references,
exposing systems to supply-chain attacks via dependency confusion. A
study found 19.7% of dependencies from tested LLMs were fabricated,
creating security risks. Open-source LLMs hallucinate more frequently
than commercial ones, with JavaScript showing higher error rates than
Python. 

 HUGGING FACE RELEASES A FREE OPERATOR-LIKE AGENTIC AI TOOL (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Hugging Face's Open Computer Agent is a cloud-hosted AI agent capable
of basic tasks but struggles with complex requests like flight
searches. Despite limitations and queue times, it showcases the
potential of open AI models powering workflows and is part of a
growing trend in agentic technology investments. A KPMG survey shows
65% of companies are experimenting with AI agents. The market is
expected to grow significantly.
