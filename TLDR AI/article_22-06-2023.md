INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE‚ÄôS URGENT PUSH TO REGULATE AI (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/20/politics/joe-biden-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=tldrai]


AI policy has become a top priority at the White House following the
rise of ChatGPT, with senior officials meeting multiple times weekly
to advance AI work on fronts like misinformation, cybersecurity, and
economic transformation. The administration plans to unveil several
policy actions this summer, including executive orders, to regulate
and harness the technology. Among other measures, tech giants like
Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are set to announce privacy and safety
commitments. 

PIXAR USED AI TO STOKE ELEMENTAL'S FLAME (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/b9cSU?utm_source=tldrai] 

Pixar turned to AI to solve a unique animation challenge for its new
movie 'Elemental', using AI to animate a character made of fire. Paul
Kanyuk, a technical supervisor at Pixar, applied Neural Style Transfer
(NST) technology to animate the fiery character, Ember. Despite the
hefty computational demand, the team achieved a 20X speed-up by
leveraging GPUs, heralding a new intersection of art and technology in
animation. 

CHINA'S UNDERGROUND MARKET FOR NVIDIA AI CHIPS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-chinas-underground-market-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-2023-06-19?utm_source=tldrai]


Despite U.S. sanctions, Nvidia's high-end A100 and H100 AI chips are
being sold on the underground market in China. This is due to strong
demand from app developers, startups, researchers, and gamers, with
prices reaching double the usual cost.

SYNTHETIC DATA AND NEXT LEVEL CURATION GIVE BIG HUMANEVAL BOOST (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644?utm_source=tldrai] 

Textbooks may be all you need for extreme AI performance. By using a
highly curated set of data and synthetic textbooks with exercises, a
1.3B parameter model achieves 50+ on HumanEval, a challenging code
benchmark. For context, this rivals ChatGPT and far surpasses the
original 12B Codex model. This paper follows the Tiny Stories line of
work and has lots of nice tidbits. 

SEQUENCEMATCH OBJECTIVE REDUCES ‚ÄúIMITATION LEARNING‚Äù HALLUCINATION
IN LANGUAGE MODELS (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05426?utm_source=tldrai] 

Language models often hallucinate/confabulate information. This is
likely because they are trained to imitate expert sequences which in
turn causes them to treat their own (potentially wrong) generations as
ground truth. Therefore, as sequence lengths grow, models are more
likely to make stuff up. However, if you treat it as a Reinforcement
Learning problem and find the next most probable action - while
including a backspace action - you can dramatically reduce these
hallucination issues.

HIGH THROUGHPUT AND MEMORY EFFICIENT TRANSFORMERS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm?utm_source=tldrai] 

As Transformers have started to gain more and more traction, they are
being served far more often than trained. This can be quite slow and
expensive, but with some clever optimizations around memory layout on
GPU, they get many multiples faster. 

WANDA: A NEW PRUNING METHOD FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/locuslab/wanda?utm_source=tldrai] 

The repo presents Wanda, a unique method for reducing the complexity
of large language models by selectively dropping less significant
network weights. Unlike other methods, Wanda doesn't require
retraining or intensive computation, providing effective model pruning
while maintaining performance. 

STANDARDIZING SPATIO-TEMPORAL PREDICTIVE LEARNING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/chengtan9907/OpenSTL?utm_source=tldrai] 

This repo introduces OpenSTL, a benchmark for models that predict
future patterns based on past frames. It categorizes approaches and
evaluates them on various datasets.

[https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses the unseen labor force that is responsible for
training artificial intelligence. These workers, known as data
labelers, are responsible for labeling data that is used to train AI
models. The work is often repetitive and low-paying, but it is
essential for the development of AI. 

ANT IS DEVELOPING AN LLM (1 MINUTE READ)

The opening credits of the Marvel Cinematic Universe series Secret
Invasion were created using AI. The AI was used to create a morphing
effect that represents the shapeshifting abilities of the Skrulls, the
alien race that is the focus of the series. The director of the
series, Ali Selim, said that he was "blown away" by AI's ability to
create the desired effect.
