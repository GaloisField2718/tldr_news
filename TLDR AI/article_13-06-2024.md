HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABLE DIFFUSION 3 OPEN WEIGHTS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Stability AI has released SD 3 weights for non-commercial use, with
commercial use available on request. 

 SHUTTERSTOCK IMAGEAI, POWERED BY DATABRICKS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Databricks has partnered with Shutterstock to build a
Shutterstock-branded AI image generation model. 

 OPENAI ANNUALIZED REVENUE DOUBLES (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has more than doubled its annualized revenue to hit $3.4B.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BERTS ARE IN-CONTEXT GENERATIVE LEARNERS (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In an alternative world, BERT models would have been discovered to be
in-context learners instead of their decoder-only GPT counterparts.
This paper explores when that is true and finds that, unsurprisingly,
BERTs are excellent at information retrieval but struggle with
knowledge acquisition - likely due to the bidirectional attention
mechanism. 

 TEXTGRAD: AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION WITH TEXT (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper explores the idea of treating a language model that can
update text as a backpropagation system. The researchers find
substantial improvements in benchmark performance, not compute
matched, against baseline models. 

 IMPROVE MATHEMATICAL REASONING WITH AUTOMATIC PROCESS SUPERVISION (24
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepMind discovered an excellent extension to the human
labor-intensive process supervision process. It found that it could
automate much of the process with strong base models, leading to
substantial mathematical reasoning performance on Gemini Pro tuned
models.

 AUTOREGRESSIVE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR IMAGE SYNTHESIS (GITHUB REPO) [12]


 Llama Gen is an autoregressive model that scales better than
diffusion alternatives for image generation. Its researchers trained a
class-conditioned model on ImageNet and achieved a new
state-of-the-art for FID. 

 DEEPMIND TORAX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Google's DeepMind has open-sourced its differentiable fusion tokamak
simulator written in Python-Jax. The simulator has strong auto-diff
capabilities and covers a number of extremely powerful PDEs. 

 SPEEDING UP DIFFUSION MODELS WITH ASYNCDIFF (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AsyncDiff is a new acceleration scheme that enables parallel
computation in diffusion models. It significantly reduces latency
without compromising quality by dividing the noise prediction model
into multiple components and running them on separate devices.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EFFICIENT LLMS WITH SPECULATIVE DECODING (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers have tackled the efficiency issues in autoregressive
large language models by exploring linear attention methods combined
with speculative decoding. This study introduces an augmentation
technique for linear attention, making it compatible with speculative
decoding and improving both training and performance. 

 MAINTAINING LARGE-SCALE AI CAPACITY AT META (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta is upgrading its global data centers to support AI demands. It
is planning to scale to 600,000 GPUs for AI training jobs. This
involves innovative maintenance strategies and tools like OpsPlanner
to ensure minimal disruptions and consistent performance while
enabling rapid infrastructure scaling.
