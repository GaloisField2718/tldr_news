HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 HUGGING FACE AND GCP PARTNERSHIP (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hugging Face has partnered with Google Cloud to give easy access to
models and compute for customers of both platforms. 

 NEW GPT-4 TURBO AND EMBEDDING MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI released a new embeddings model, a better and cheaper GPT-3.5
Turbo, and a less lazy GPT-4 Turbo preview. It has improved pricing
and tried to improve the GPT-4 Turbo preview model to prevent the
laziness issue in code generation. 

 QDRANT RAISES $28M SERIES A (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The vector database company that powers portions of ChatGPT and X's
‚ÄúMore like this‚Äù has raised money to improve its Rust-based vector
store and expand its enterprise offerings.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DITTOGYM: LEARNING TO CONTROL SOFT SHAPE-SHIFTING ROBOTS (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Soft robotics is a challenge due to the large control space. This
work introduces a simulator with various tasks for manipulating soft
‚Äúditto‚Äù like objects. It contains utilities, visualization, and
some strong baselines. 

 SCENE GRAPH GENERATION WITH TRANSFORMERS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed a new method for creating scene graphs,
making the process faster and more efficient. Their transformer-based
technique focuses on improving the way the model understands and
connects different elements in an image, leading to better performance
on challenging tasks. 

 SPEECH GENERATION WITH SPEECHGPT-GEN (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 SpeechGPT-Gen is a new speech synthesis model that efficiently
handles the complexities of language and voice characteristics.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 POWER BI ON MICROSOFT FABRIC: MARKETING OR A REAL SEMANTIC LAYER
SOLUTION? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Microsoft is marketing its Fabric Lakehouse architecture as an ideal
way to manage Power BI semantic models. This tech talk [12] will
examine these claims in light of AtScale‚Äôs TPC-DS benchmark [13],
measuring Power BI performance on Microsoft Fabric on 100GB, 1TB, and
10TB of data. Tune in for the results ‚Üó [13] 

 LLM STEER - LIBRARY FOR CONTROLLING GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 LLM Steer is a library for controlling language model generation with
sentiment vectors. This means you can embed a concept like
‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù and make the generation more thoughtful. It tends to
work better than prompting in general, but more study is needed. 

 ROTATION MANIPULATION IN PYTORCH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 RoMa is a library for PyTorch for dealing with tricky rotations. It
is reasonably efficient and can be used to help with any project that
uses 3D data. 

 EVALUATION BOARD OF MULTI-TURN LLM (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AgentBoard is a benchmark designed for multi-turn LLM agents,
complemented by an analytical evaluation board for detailed model
assessment beyond final success rates. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 IMPLEMENT A SPARSE MIXTURE OF EXPERTS LANGUAGE MODEL FROM SCRATCH (22
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A walkthrough with code on writing a sparse Mixture of Experts model
from scratch in Pytorch. There are diagrams and explanations for each
step. The explanation of top-k routing is particularly insightful. 

 AI TODAY AND TRENDS FOR AN AI FUTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A survey of experts on how early adopters are using AI today and
where AI is going in 2024. 

 BETTER IMAGE SIMILARITY METRIC (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Image similarity systems give a score based on how similar two images
are. This work improves upon previous methods, primarily by relying on
synthetic data and human preferences.

 3D MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 SegMamba is a model designed for 3D medical image segmentation. It
offers a more efficient alternative to the Transformer architecture. 

 SPARKSOCIAL (PRODUCT) [21] 

 Track keywords across social media to convert leads with AI-generated
auto-replies. 

 IMPROVING SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION WITH A NEW METHOD (GITHUB REPO) [22] 

 Researchers have developed a Shared Feature Calibration (SFC) method
to enhance semantic segmentation.
