HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 HOW BIG TECH IS SWALLOWING THE AI INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Amazon has hired most of Adept's team, another aspiring OpenAI
competitor, and licensed its technology, following a pattern that
mirrors Microsoft's acquisition approach with Inflection. This move
reflects a trend where big tech companies absorb AI talent and
innovations without formal acquisitions to navigate antitrust
scrutiny. Such strategies may become commonplace as the AI industry
faces consolidation and high development costs. 

 INTEL SHOWS OFF FIRST FULLY INTEGRATED OPTICAL COMPUTE INTERCONNECT,
DESIGNED TO SCALE UP AI WORKLOADS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Intel has presented the industry's first fully integrated optical
compute interconnect (OCI) chiplet designed to significantly boost
high-bandwidth data interconnect performance. Essential for growing AI
demands, the milestone represents a step forward in silicon photonics,
combining integrated circuits with lasers to enhance data transfer
rates and support AI infrastructure scaling. The OCI chiplet aims to
overcome the limitations of current electrical I/O interconnects by
enabling higher bandwidth and longer-distance data transmission. 

 LLM101N: LET'S BUILD A STORYTELLER (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Andrej Karpathy announced a new course that guides learners in
building a Storyteller AI Large Language Model from scratch. It covers
the fundamentals of web app implementation using Python, C, and CUDA.
The content spans language modeling, deep learning frameworks, and AI
deployment including multimodal applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MAGIC INSERT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Method from Google to insert semantic objects into images with
diffusion. Dataset and demo available. 

 CTR PREDICTIONS WITH A NEW TOKENIZATION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UIST is a novel approach that drastically improves click-through rate
predictions by converting dense embeddings into compact, discrete
tokens for user and item representations. 

 ENHANCED CAUSALITY UNDERSTANDING (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CELLO is a new dataset with 14,094 causal questions to improve AI's
grasp of causality beyond commonsense reasoning. 

üßë‚Äçüíª 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 CAMERA TRACKING WITH MULTI-SESSION SLAM (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Multi-Session SLAM is a new system that innovatively tracks camera
movements across several unconnected video sequences under one
universal frame of reference. 

 OPENSTREETVIEW-5M: A GLOBAL DATASET FOR LOCALIZING IMAGES (GITHUB
REPO) [11] 

 OpenStreetView-5M is a significant open-access dataset with over 5
million geo-tagged street images from 225 countries designed to push
the limits of computer vision by testing image localization
capabilities. 

 MAKING SAM MORE PRACTICAL WITH POST-TRAINING QUANTIZATION (GITHUB
REPO) [12] 

 PTQ4SAM is a new framework designed to reduce the memory and
computation demands of the large-scale Segment Anything Model (SAM). 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 CONTRA ACEMOGLU ON AI (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Economist Daron Acemoglu's working paper on AI suggests a modest
0.06% annual increase in TFP growth, challenging more optimistic
forecasts. He distinguishes AI's productivity impact through four
channels but discounts deepening of automation and creation of new
labor-intensive products, arguably underestimating AI's full economic
potential. Critics find his approach overly narrow, potentially
misrepresenting the broader macroeconomic implications of AI
advancements. 

 BOOSTING SMARTPHONE CAMERA CLARITY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project introduces a method for enhancing image resolution on
smartphones using a self-supervised learning model that improves
reference-based super-resolution (RefSR). 

 SPEECH ENHANCEMENT WITH SEMAMBA (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SEMamba is a new speech enhancement system that leverages the Mamba
state-space model to improve the clarity of speech signals.
