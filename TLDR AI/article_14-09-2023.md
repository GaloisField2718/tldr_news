DO LANGUAGE MODELS REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WORLD? (19 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05936v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers looked into how well pretrained language models understand
the basic building blocks and rules of the world, like 'a dog is an
animal' or 'an apple is a fruit.' They found that these programs are
decent at remembering some of this foundational knowledge, but aren't
perfect at reasoning with it.
