AMAZON TELLS EMPLOYEES IT ISN‚ÄôT FALLING BEHIND ON AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/InH0y?utm_source=tldrai] 

Despite Amazon's absence in the generative AI race, executives
maintain that the company is actively involved in the AI space. Swami
Sivasubramanian, Amazon's VP of database, analytics, and machine
learning, said that Amazon's 100,000+ machine learning customers are
interested in using the company's technology for personalization,
search engine results, and call center automation. While Amazon Web
Services has partnered with AI companies like Stability AI and Hugging
Face, the company has not launched a consumer-facing generative AI
product, leading to speculation that it may be lagging behind its
competitors. 

CHATSPOT 3, NOW WITH GPT-4 (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.chatspot.ai/yipee-its-chatspot-3-alpha?utm_source=tldrai]


ChatSpot has launched its Alpha 3 version, which features numerous
improvements and now uses GPT-4 for better responses. The application
can process up to 32,000 tokens and offers a new Prompt Library for
sample prompts. Additionally, ChatSpot can now generate summaries of
publicly accessible articles, support HubSpot ops/admin prompts,
provide enhanced company research features, and perform deeper
research on domain registrations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

AGENTS ARE THE NEW PARADIGM (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442?utm_source=tldrai] 

What happens if you use language models to simulate an entire town?
They ask each other out on Valentine's dates. This paper explores what
happens if you give language models open-ended tasks and shows that
you can observe remarkable human-like social capabilities from these
agents, such as keeping schedules, planning activities, and
reminiscing about previous interactions. This is one step in a broader
trend of language models moving more towards agent-like paradigms,
which dramatically changes the safety considerations for true model
alignment. 

A TUTORIAL INTRODUCTION TO REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00803?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper provides a brief survey of Reinforcement Learning (RL), with
a focus on Stochastic Approximation (SA) as a unifying theme. The
scope includes Markov Reward Processes, Markov Decision Processes,
Stochastic Approximation algorithms, and widely used algorithms like
Temporal Difference Learning and Q-learning. 

LLMMAPS - A VISUAL METAPHOR FOR STRATIFIED EVALUATION OF LLMS (13
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00457?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper introduces LLMMaps, a visualization technique that allows
for the stratified evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
Q&A datasets, providing detailed insights into their knowledge
capabilities and enabling comparative analysis of multiple LLMs. The
approach was tested on state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluated through
user feedback.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

SEGMENT ANYTHING CHROME EXTENSION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/kevmo314/magic-copy?utm_source=tldrai] 

Since the Segment Anything Model from Meta is so lightweight, it can
run directly in the browser. As a result, we can copy items from
images directly to the clipboard - in the wild. It works just like the
demo from Meta, but instead of displaying the segmented object, that
object is copied to the system clipboard for you to paste as needed. 

OPENPLAYGROUND (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/nat/openplayground?utm_source=tldrai] 

Openplayground is an LLM playground you can run on your laptop. 

UPTRAIN (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?utm_source=tldrai] 

UpTrain is an open-source framework to observe ML applications built
for engineers.

GO SMALL OR GO HOME (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.harmdevries.com/post/model-size-vs-compute-overhead/?utm_source=tldrai]


Language models used to generate text follow natural scaling laws.
This means we can predict performance of the model given model size,
data amount, compute spent. A lot of papers such as Chinchilla or the
original Kaplan paper are interested in the compute optimal
configuration. It turns out that if you train a smaller model for much
longer, while it is not compute optimal it often has better
performance than its larger counterparts. This post explores the
trade-off between model size and compute overhead, and gives some nice
heuristics that you can use depending on your language model use case.
