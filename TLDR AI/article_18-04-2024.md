 STABILITY AI MAKES THE STABLE DIFFUSION API AVAILABLE (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Stability AI has made its latest text-to-image AI model, Stable
Diffusion 3, available to some developers via API and its new content
creation platform called Stable Assistant Beta. The model is still in
preview and not yet available to the general public. 

 EUROPEAN CAR MANUFACTURER WILL PILOT SANCTUARY AI'S HUMANOID ROBOT (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sanctuary AI will deliver its humanoid robot, Phoenix, to a Magna
auto manufacturing facility, following Magna's 2021 investment in the
company. Phoenix is notable for its walking capability and dexterous
hands aimed at enhancing manufacturing efficiency. The specifics of
the pilot, including the number of robots and deployment details,
remain undisclosed.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MISTRAL 8X22B REPORT AND INSTRUCTION MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The new base Mistral report was released today. Additionally, their
own instruction tuned model was released under a similar permissive
license. They report a strong MMLU and HumanEval performance along
with incredible multilingual English, French, Italian, German, and
Spanish performance, function calling, and 64k native context length. 

 HOW TO IMPROVE 24 POINTS IN MMLU WITH OLMO (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The latest completely open 7B language model had an upgrade with a
much-improved reasoning score on MMLU. Its development team found that
changing the data mixture had a substantial effect on performance.
They have provided the exact statistics of new data sources and
percentages that led to this improvement. 

 STABLE AUDIO PAPER (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This paper describes Stability AI's diffusion transformer model for
audio synthesis.

 THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING ML MODELS TO PRODUCTION (37 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 A deep dive interview from industry experts on the challenges and
solutions of getting AI models into production and where MLOps differs
from traditional engineering. They discuss why so few ML projects make
it to production and how to focus as an organization to actually
launch. 

 EFFORT (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Effort library allows for real-time adjustment of the number of
calculations performed during inference of an LLM model, resulting in
significant speed improvements while retaining most of the quality.
Despite some implementation overhead, initial results suggest that the
Effort library has the potential to significantly improve LLM
inference speed while maintaining quality. The author encourages
others to test the 0.0.1B version and provide feedback to further
improve the library. 

 IMAGE CAPTIONING WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This study revisits using diffusion models for image-to-text
generation. It introduces the LaDiC architecture, which enhances
diffusion models' performance in image captioning tasks.

 DRIVING WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Wayve's Lingo-2 is a VLM train in simulation for autonomous driving
tasks. It performs driving actions based on video input. Lingo-2
includes descriptions of reasoning for the driving actions it takes
based on the scene. 

 IS ATTENTION ALL YOU NEED? (29 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers are developing alternative architectures to address the
limitations of Transformers in long-context learning, generation, and
inference speed, showing competitive quality at smaller scales but
uncertain scalability. The rapid progress in this subfield suggests
that the Pareto frontier will continue to expand, enabling longer
context modeling and greater inference throughput, ultimately
increasing the number of use cases for AI. 

 THE SHIFTING DYNAMICS AND META-MOATS OF AI (14 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Building a successful AI company requires navigating complex short,
mid, and long-term dynamics and maintaining elite speed and execution,
owning more of the stack, gathering unique data, and leveraging
synthetic data generation. As the AI industry matures, companies must
adapt to shifting talent dynamics and understand the machine they are
building and the axes of competition they are predicated on to create
lasting moats and stand out amidst the noise.
