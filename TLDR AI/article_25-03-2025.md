 DEMONSTRATE TRUSTWORTHY AI PRACTICES: GET THE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're building an AI business, achieving ISO 42001 compliance [4]
shows your customers that you are taking the necessary steps to ensure
responsible usage and development of AI. But this can cost you real
time and  money.

With Vanta, achieving compliance can be done in a fraction of the
time. 95% of required document templates [4] are pre-built,
accelerating the work — and helping you build trust and scale. 

Start with the ISO 42001 checklist [4], which gives a breakdown of the
compliance process.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING TOGETHER CHAT: USE DEEPSEEK R1 FOR FREE, HOSTED IN NORTH
AMERICA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Together Chat has launched a free consumer app that offers seamless
interaction with top open-source models, including the new DeepSeek R1
for advanced reasoning. It supports web crawling, code generation with
Qwen Coder 32B, and image creation using Flux Schnell, all accessible
via a Progressive Web App. 

 ROBLOX'S NEW AI MODEL CAN GENERATE 3D OBJECTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Roblox has open-sourced Cube 3D, an AI model that can generate 3D
objects from text prompts, to enhance creation efficiency. Cube 3D
uses tokenization techniques and is trained with licensed and publicly
available datasets, plus Roblox experience data. Future iterations
will incorporate multimodal inputs like images and videos. 

 NEW REVE IMAGE GENERATOR BEATS AI ART HEAVYWEIGHTS MIDJOURNEY AND
FLUX AT A PENNY PER IMAGE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reve Image 1.0, an AI image generator, offers competitive pricing and
impressive prompt adherence, realism, and versatility, potentially
outperforming rivals like Midjourney and Ideogram. At $5 for 500
credits, it allows affordable generation of high-quality images but
lacks an edit feature and mobile app, which may deter advanced users.
Despite limited transparency about its team and technology, Reve
remains a strong cost-effective choice for users seeking high-quality
outputs without extensive technical know-how. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLAVA-MORE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LLaVA-MORE systematically evaluates different language models and
visual backbones in multimodal LLMs, providing a reproducible
framework for comparing architectures. 

 SKELETON-BASED ACTION SEGMENTATION (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TRG-Net enhances action segmentation using text-derived relational
graphs for improved spatial-temporal modeling and supervision. 

 HIERARCHICAL DOCUMENT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS (49 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UniHDSA is a unified relation prediction approach for hierarchical
document structure analysis, enabling a single module to handle
multiple tasks simultaneously. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SINGLE IMAGE PERSONALIZATION WITHOUT TRAINING (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 SISO enables training-free personalization for image generation and
editing by optimizing similarity loss iteratively. 

 AWESOME MRI RECONSTRUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A curated collection of articles about deep learning in MRI
reconstruction. 

 OPEN-SOURCE OMNI-MODAL FOUNDATION MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Baichuan Omni 1.5 model supports text, image, video, and audio
inputs as well as text and audio outputs. This means it is another
example of an any-to-any style model, sometimes referred to as
natively multimodal. The model, like many, uses an interleaved
multimodal tokens approach where different types of tokens are routed
to different encoders/decoders that all get processed by some main
auto-regressive model.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MCP (MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL): SIMPLY EXPLAINED IN 5 MINUTES (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT
integrate with your everyday apps—turning them from isolated
chatbots into powerful assistants with real-world capabilities.
Instead of copying error logs into your AI, MCP lets you simply say
"read my browser console and fix this bug" and the AI can directly
access those tools. Behind the scenes, MCP works through a standard
interface where providers like Slack, GitHub, and Sentry can create
"adapters" that translate AI requests into API calls. 

 FINE-TUNE GEMMA 3 FOR FREE (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Unsloth team has figured out some of the quirks with the new open
weights model from DeepMind. By integrating with their toolkit, one
can train the model on a free Colab instance. 

 OPENAI'S O1-PRO IS THE COMPANY'S MOST EXPENSIVE AI MODEL YET (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's o1-pro, a more computing-intensive version of its o1
reasoning AI, is now available in its developer API for select users
at a premium cost. Priced at $150 per million input tokens and $600
per million output tokens, it offers better performance but has
received mixed early reviews as it struggles with certain tasks.
Despite improvements, internal benchmarks show only slight performance
gains over the standard o1 model in coding and math.
