 DELVE GOES VIRAL ON X FOR PULLING ALL-NIGHTERS TO SHIP AUTOPILOT FOR
SOC 2 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Delve officially launched Computer Use Agents that allow founders and
GRC teams to go auto-capture all screenshots for SOC 2.

And customers are using it to achieve incredible results:

	* Lovable got fully SOC 2 compliant in less than 20 hours
	* 11x ditched their old compliance platform, saved 143 hours on SOC 2
[5], and unlocked $1.2M ARR
 	* Bland AI got SOC 2 and unlocked $500k ARR within 7 days

If you want to ditch your old platform, they'll even migrate you off
for FREE.

Book a demo here [6] for $2000 off compliance in April!

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI GPT-4.1 (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has launched three new models in its API: GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1
mini, and GPT‑4.1 nano. These models outperform GPT‑4o and
GPT‑4o mini across the board, with major gains in coding and
instruction following. They also have larger context
windows—supporting up to 1 million tokens of context—and are able
to better use that context with improved long-context comprehension.
They feature a refreshed knowledge cutoff of June 2024. 

 HUGGING FACE ACQUIRES POLLEN ROBOTICS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hugging Face, the center of the open source AI community, has long
stated its goal is to be a decentralized DeepMind. While this isn't
exactly the case, adding in an open source robotics platform via
Pollen moves it closer to that goal. 

 DOLPHINGEMMA (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepMind has announced DolphinGemma, a large language model developed
by Google that helps scientists study how dolphins communicate — and
hopefully find out what they're saying, too. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SEAWEED-7B: COST-EFFECTIVE TRAINING OF VIDEO GENERATION FOUNDATION
MODEL (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The ByteDance team has released a paper showing how to train a
competitive 7B parameter video generation model on a “modest”
compute budget of 655k H100 hours. It has strong performance on a
number of temporally difficult tasks. 

 PIXELFLOW: PIXEL-SPACE GENERATIVE MODELS WITH FLOW (30 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Most generative models on continuous signals operate in latent space
due to computational constraints. This work introduces a series of
cascades that allow the generation to happen directly in pixel space.
This eliminates the need for a pretrained VAE. 

 INTERACTVLM: 3D INTERACTION REASONING FROM 2D FOUNDATIONAL MODELS (24
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 New VLM that can reason about contacts between humans in 3D and
objects. It does so by leveraging a strong base model and lifting its
reasoning into 3D with clever multi-view rendering. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 3B PARAMETER TOKENIZER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Scaling up image tokenizers is challenging because they tend to
collapse. This work introduces GigaTok, which is a massive tokenizer
with superior reconstruction performance. Decoder scaling and
regularization helped with stability and overall quality. 

 IMPROVED MOE WITH C3PO (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 C3PO introduces a new test-time optimization technique that improves
accuracy in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs by re-mixing expert weights based
on similar reference samples. 

 VISUAL REASONING WITH LESS DATA (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using MCTS to quantify sample difficulty, ThinkLite-VL improves
reasoning in VLMs with just 11k training samples and no distillation. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 BROWSECOMP BENCHMARK FOR HARD-TO-FIND KNOWLEDGE (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's BrowseComp is a new benchmark of 1,266 problems designed to
evaluate AI agents' browsing skills in gathering complex,
hard-to-locate information online. 

 BUSINESS LEADERS' THOUGHTS ON AI POSSIBILITIES (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Executives from nine companies share how they're leveraging Google
Cloud's AI tools to drive innovation across sectors, with over 600
real-world use cases highlighted. 

 6 HIGHLIGHTS FROM GOOGLE CLOUD NEXT 25 (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Vertex AI introduces updates to video, image, speech, and music
generation models, enhancing creative workflows for businesses. Google
AI is enabling specialized AI agents for companies, improving
productivity and security. A new Agent2Agent Protocol allows different
AI agents to securely communicate across platforms.

 DEEPSEEK TO OPEN SOURCE ITS INFERENCE ENGINE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 DeepSeek's inference engine is built on VLLM, although it is now
heavily modified. 

 NVIDIA TO MANUFACTURE AI SUPERCOMPUTERS IN THE U.S. (12 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 NVIDIA is localizing AI hardware production by building factories in
Texas and Arizona, aiming to produce Blackwell chips and AI
supercomputers entirely within the U.S. 

 GEMINI ADDS QUESTION GENERATION TO GOOGLE CLASSROOM (1 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 Educators can now use Gemini to generate questions or quizzes from
selected text in Google Classroom, enhancing lesson interactivity and
streamlining content creation.
