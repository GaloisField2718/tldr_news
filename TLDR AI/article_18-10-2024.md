RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 META RELEASING “MOVIE GEN BENCH” (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 “Movie Gen Bench” is an evaluation benchmark for assessing both
video (Video Bench) and audio (Audio Bench) performance. It consists
of 1,003 prompts that cover all the different testing
aspects/concepts. 

 META DECISION TRANSFORMER (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT) is designed to improve
generalization in reinforcement learning by combining
transformer-based sequential modeling with robust task representation
learning. 

 ENHANCING TEXT-TO-IMAGE ALIGNMENT FOR LONG TEXTS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 LongAlign improves text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models' ability to
handle long text inputs by introducing segment-level encoding and
decomposed preference optimization. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AUTO-REGRESSIVE MODEL FOR IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 DiGIT is an auto-regressive generative model that predicts tokens in
a latent space using self-supervised learning. It is a discrete
tokenizer that improves image generation on ImageNet by clustering
hidden states from DINOv2. 

 EFFICIENT FEDERATED LEARNING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The FedPart method addresses the layer mismatch issue in federated
learning by restricting model updates to specific layers during each
training round. 

 DISTRIBUTED TRAINING GUIDE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This is a comprehensive guide on best practices for distributed
training, diagnosing errors, and fully utilizing all resources
available.

 WHERE'S THE GENERATIVE AI ROI? START WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Generative AI is transforming supply chain operations by efficiently
processing unstructured documents, leading to significant time and
cost savings. Flexport, a supply chain tech company, has successfully
integrated AI to automate and streamline document handling, reducing
processing time by 80%. This application of AI demonstrates its value
in practical, revenue-generating tasks rather than more speculative AI
advancements. 

 FOLLOW THE QUIET VOICES TO FIND AI'S TRUTHS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI discourse is polarized, with opposing pro-AI and anti-AI factions
dominating the conversation. Synthetical thinkers, who approach AI
with nuanced perspectives beyond binary viewpoints, are currently
missing from this debate. These truth-seekers may eventually return
when AI becomes less controversial and more integrated into everyday
life. 

 INVISIBLE TEXT THAT AI CHATBOTS UNDERSTAND AND HUMANS CAN'T? YEP,
IT'S A THING (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Recent research highlights vulnerabilities in LLMs like prompt
injection and ASCII smuggling, which allow attackers to hide
instructions or data that are invisible to users but readable by the
models. Invisible Unicode characters can be used in AI chatbots like
Claude and Copilot to embed and extract malicious payloads and
sensitive data. This poses a significant security risk. While some AI
platforms like OpenAI and Microsoft have implemented mitigations, the
broader issue of AI processing data imperceptible to humans continues
to challenge security protocols.
