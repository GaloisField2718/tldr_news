HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STACK OVERFLOW AND OPENAI PARTNERSHIP (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stack Overflow, a popular programming website, and OpenAI are
partnering to provide a data API for OpenAI customers to retrieve real
time and vetted data. 

 ELON MUSK'S PLAN FOR AI NEWS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk plans to enhance X's AI, Grok, to merge live news with
social media commentary to provide updates and citations in real time.
Grok will generate news summaries from user discussions on X, focusing
on engagement and accuracy. The project faces challenges with proper
citation and legal concerns.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 UNSLOTH.AI: EASILY FINETUNE & TRAIN LLMS (58 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Video from the founder of Unsloth on how its team uses PyTorch,
writes their kernels, and designs their API surface. Unsloth's
framework and library are extremely powerful and easy to use. 

 IMPROVING HETEROGENEOUS GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SlotGAT is a new approach that improves heterogeneous graph neural
networks by addressing the semantic mixing issue in traditional
message passing. 

 DEEPFAKE DETECTION USING MASKED IMAGE MODELING (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This new method detects deepfakes by focusing on masked image
modeling, especially in the frequency domain. The approach differs
from traditional methods and shows significant improvement in
identifying synthetic images, even from new AI generative techniques.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HUGGING FACE ROBOTICS LIBRARY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 The team at Hugging Face has released a new project that nicely
packages common tools needed for robotics development. 

 ENHANCING VISUAL ABILITIES WITH MORPH-TOKENS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Researchers have developed "Morph-Tokens" to improve AI's visual
understanding and image generation capabilities. These tokens
transform abstract concepts used for comprehension into detailed
visuals for image creation, leveraging the advanced processing power
of the MLLM framework. 

 MEET VIBE-EVAL: EVALUATING MULTIMODAL CHAT MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Vibe-Eval is a newly launched benchmark designed to test multimodal
chat models with 269 visual understanding prompts, including 100
particularly challenging ones. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEPSEEK-V2 (HUGGING FACE HUB) [13] 

 DeepSeek has released a 200B+ parameter model with 21B active
parameters. It performs extremely well on code and reasoning. It's not
clear if it is overall better than Llama 3 70B, but it is a welcome
addition to the open model ecosystem. 

 AI PROMPT ENGINEERING IS DEAD (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Automating prompt optimization for AI models suggests a future where
manual prompt engineering may become obsolete, pointing towards more
efficient, model-driven methods of generating effective prompts. 

 LIMITS OF VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS IN VISUAL REASONING (GITHUB REPO)
[15] 

 Vision-Language Models like GPT-4V are advancing rapidly in
understanding and interacting with images and text. A recent study
uncovers their significant limitations in visual deductive reasoning.
Researchers tested these models using complex visual puzzles, like
those found in IQ tests, and discovered that they struggle with
multi-step reasoning and recognizing abstract patterns.
