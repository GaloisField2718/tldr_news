HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

INSTAGRAM FOUNDERS LAUNCH PERSONALIZED NEWS APP (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/22/instagrams-co-founders-personalized-news-app-artifact-launches-to-the-public-with-new-features?utm_source=tldrai]


Artifact, the personalized news reader built by Instagram‚Äôs
co-founders, is now open to the public, no sign-up required. At the
core of Artifact is algorithms and machine learning technology that is
used to create a curated set of news articles for each user based on
how they engage with the app‚Äôs content. The founders hint at using
Transformers as the core piece of technology behind their AI. 

TOME RAISES $43M SERIES B FOR AI POWERED STORY TELLING (3 MINUTE READ)
[http://bit.ly/3IqAIGw] 

A mix between powerpoint, figma, and docs - Tome is a creative tool
powered by generative technologies. It has been growing quickly and
looks like a potentially interesting combination of several ideas that
have been in the community for the past several months. This brings
their total money raised to just over $75m. 

APIS ARE THE FUTURE OF CHATBOTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/next-up-for-ai-chatbots-its-all-about?utm_source=tldrai]


The use of chatbots as demos to sell generative AI tools is gaining
momentum. Companies are now preparing APIs for developers to build
their own generative AI platforms. Early applications of the
technology include customer service, gaming, and marketing. OpenAI has
partnered with Bain, and Coca-Cola plans to use the technology for
marketing. The race to enable the future of generative AI is now
underway, and companies that enable successful AI applications stand
to benefit tremendously.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LATENT VIDEO DIFFUSION MODELS (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07685?utm_source=tldrai] 

One of the main bottlenecks of generative video work is the inability
of current methods to scale to the massive number of frames or
maintain temporal consistency in generation. This work tries to solve
both problems at the same time by working in a projective latent
space. They obtain impressive FID scores on standard benchmarks and
have fun videos on their project page. 

NEW (THEORETICALLY MOTIVATED) SAMPLER FOR DIFFUSION MODELS
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVES QUALITY (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11552?utm_source=tldrai] 

By building on the fascinating ‚Äúscore based‚Äù interpretation of
diffusion models, this work investigates why diffusion models fail at
various tasks that require composition. They determine that the
sampler, and not the underlying model, must be the source of error.
They then propose a new energy-based parameterization and
Metropolis-corrected sampler. They show strong improvement on a
variety of tough tasks. Also, as a smaller win, they have a nice
background section on all these topics! 

MODULAR DEEP LEARNING: A SOLUTION TO DEVELOPING MODELS FOR MULTIPLE
TASKS (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11529?utm_source=tldrai] 

Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution for
developing models that specialize in multiple tasks without incurring
negative interference and that generalize systematically to
non-identically distributed tasks. This article provides a survey of
modular architectures, explores various additional purposes of
modularity, and reports various concrete applications where modularity
has been successfully deployed. 

A STUDY OF PROMPT TUNING, IN-CONTEXT LEARNING, AND INSTRUCTION PROMPT
TUNING (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11521?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses the use of parameter-efficient adaptation
methods such as prompt tuning (PT), in-context learning (ICL), and
instruction prompt tuning (IPT) for fine-tuning large language models.
The paper empirically studies when and how in-context examples improve
prompt tuning, and observes that IPT does not always outperform PT, PT
is unstable, and prompts learned for a specific source task via PT
exhibit positive transfer when paired with in-context examples of a
different target task.

PAPERS ON THE UX OF AI PROGRAMMING ASSISTANTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://austinhenley.com/blog/uxaicoding.html?utm_source=tldrai] 

It could be argued that in addition to the powerful model,
co-pilot‚Äôs success is because of the innovative user experience. In
any case, this page provides a list of papers that study the
effectiveness of different choices on users of programming assistant
tools. 

VID2AVATAR: LEARNING HUMAN AVATARS FROM MONOCULAR IN-THE-WILD VIDEOS
(4 MINUTE READ)
[https://moygcc.github.io/vid2avatar/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article presents a method called Vid2Avatar, which learns human
avatars from monocular in-the-wild videos without the need for ground
truth supervision, external segmentation modules, or priors extracted
from large datasets. The method solves the task of surface
reconstruction and scene decomposition by jointly modeling the human
and background in the scene using two separate neural fields. 

MOCHIDIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/godly-devotion/MochiDiffusion?utm_source=tldrai] 

This app brings stable diffusion to Macs. This app uses Apple's Core
ML Stable Diffusion implementation to achieve maximum performance and
speed on Apple Silicon based Macs while reducing memory requirements.
It also runs on Intel based Macs too.

HOW NVIDIA DOMINATED AI - AND PLANS TO KEEP IT THAT WAY (8 MINUTE
READ)
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-nvidia-dominated-ai-and-plans-to-keep-it-that-way-as-generative-ai-explodes/?utm_source=tldrai]


Since the creation of AlexNet in 2012, GPUs have been the primary work
horse for AI. Nvidia has made many savvy strategic moves in both
hardware and software that have positioned them to be one of the
biggest winners in the recent generative AI boom. Their chips power a
large majority of all exciting AI applications today with little signs
of slowing down. This article is a nice history of some of the key
players and decisions they made that lead to their current (and
hopefully future) success. 

INTRO TO DATA-CENTRIC AI (ONLINE COURSE)
[https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This is the first-ever course that merges the intersection between
data science and AI/ML. Data-Centric AI (DCAI) is an emerging science
that studies techniques to improve datasets, which is often the best
way to improve performance in practical ML applications. While good
data scientists have long practiced this manually via ad hoc
trial/error and intuition, DCAI considers the improvement of data as a
systematic engineering discipline. 

HOW I BROKE INTO A BANK ACCOUNT WITH AN AI-GENERATED VOICE (5 MINUTE

AI-CREATED IMAGES LOSE U.S. COPYRIGHTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/ZpytV?utm_source=tldrai] 

The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that images in a graphic novel
created by AI should not have been granted copyright protections, one
of the first decisions by a U.S. Court or Agency on the topic of AI
art and copyrights.
