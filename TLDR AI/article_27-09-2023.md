RESEARCH & INNOVATION

MAKING BETTER VIRTUAL VIEWS OF IMAGES (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13039v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are great for creating virtual views but
struggle with shiny or see-through objects. This new method, called
refractive-reflective field, fixes this by better handling light
changes and producing clearer images of such tricky objects. 

A MORE CONSISTENT IMAGE EDITING (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adundar/projects/DivSem/?utm_source=tldrai]

Most current tools for semantic image editing, where images are
changed based on their meaning, struggle with blending new objects
smoothly into scenes. This new method improves this by smartly
understanding both fully seen and partially hidden objects. 

A NEW TOOL TO FIX BROKEN VIDEOS (19 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13890v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Over the last ten years, there have been big improvements in fixing
damaged videos using special technologies. However, many of these
tools aren't perfect at fixing common video issues seen in things like
live streaming. This study created BSCV, a new collection of tools and
videos to help fix these problems even better.
