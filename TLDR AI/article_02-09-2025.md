 OPENAI PLANS INDIA DATA CENTER IN MAJOR STARGATE EXPANSION (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI plans to build a massive new data center in India. It is
currently scouting for local partners to help it set up the data
center, which will have at least 1-gigawatt capacity. The exact
location and timeline of the project are unclear. OpenAI is set to
open an office in New Delhi and is hiring to expand its local team. It
has committed to work with the government on its $1.2 billion IndiaAI
Mission, which seeks to build large and small language models for the
country.

 INSIDE VLLM: ANATOMY OF A HIGH-THROUGHPUT LLM INFERENCE SYSTEM (30
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This is a technical breakdown of the core components and advanced
features of modern high-throughput LLM inference systems, from
PagedAttention's memory management breakthrough to the distributed
serving architectures that enable the efficiency behind large-scale AI
deployment. 

 AI AND JOBS, AGAIN (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 If AI truly reduced labor demand in software development and customer
service, why would companies simultaneously avoid hiring 22-year-olds
while rushing to hire middle-aged workers in the same
occupations—and why haven't wages declined alongside employment?
Recent studies about AI's labor impact are overstated and the result
of cherry-picked data. 

 THE SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS OF AI (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI vendor revenue outpaces traditional software, doubling in new
bookings and impacting MongoDB's Atlas, which saw a resurgence with
29% growth. AI-native companies increasingly choose Atlas for its
scalable vector search capabilities, adding over 5,000 customers in
the last two quarters. This AI-driven demand shift not only boosts
MongoDB but also significantly affects broader software distribution
channels.

 HOW TO TURN YOUR AI EXPERIMENTS INTO CORE BUSINESS PROCESSES
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Everyone's using AI - but for most, it's still in the siloed
tinkering stage. Effectively integrating AI [11] into business
processes in ways that drive productivity (and ROI) can be your
competitive advantage. Learn how to get it right in Camunda's Ultimate
Guide to AI-Powered Process Orchestration & Automation [11]. 

 A SURVEY OF FRONTIERS IN LLM REASONING: INFERENCE SCALING, LEARNING
TO REASON, AND AGENTIC SYSTEMS (65 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LLM reasoning methods fit into two dimensions: regimes
(inference-time vs. training-based) and architectures (standalone vs.
agentic systems). There's been a shift from inference scaling like the
original o1 to learning-to-reason approaches like DeepSeek-R1 as part
of the transition to agentic workflows. 

 R-4B: BI-MODE MULTIMODAL LLM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 R-4B is a multimodal LLM that adaptively switches between
step-by-step reasoning and direct answers using a bi-mode training
framework.

 COMPILING DINNER (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Seeing the world through a compiler's lens makes everyday systems
feel less like mysteries and more like programmable environments.
Traditionally, building a compiler required deep expertise and a lot
of patience. Large language models change that. It's now possible to
describe rules in plain English and have models sketch out the code to
tokenize, parse, and execute them. Compilers were previously a niche
reserved for specialists. Now, anyone can sketch out one for their
domain of interest and immediately see the connections between intent
and execution. 

 HOW SHEER LUCK MADE THIS TINY CARIBBEAN ISLAND MILLIONS FROM ITS WEB
ADDRESS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anguilla stumbled into a windfall when it received the .ai domain in
the 80s. The 16,000-person Caribbean territory now earns $39 million
annually, nearly a quarter of government revenues, from companies
paying $700,000 for domains, like you.ai, across over 850,000 .ai
domains.
