HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI CO-FOUNDER JOHN SCHULMAN LEAVES ANTHROPIC (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 John Schulman, a key figure behind ChatGPT, has left Anthropic after
just five months. While his reasons remain unclear, the departure
marks a significant shift in the AI research landscape. 

 LYFT AND ANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIP (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lyft is collaborating with Anthropic to integrate Claude-powered AI
solutions, reducing customer service resolution times by 87% and
enhancing the overall rideshare experience through AI-driven
automation and engineering improvements. 

 DOES AI NEED ALL THAT MONEY? (TECH GIANTS SAY YES) (8 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 DeepSeek's claim of training a top-performing AI model for $5.6m
shook the US market, impacting Nvidia's valuation and raising
questions about hefty AI infrastructure investments from the likes of
Meta and Microsoft. Despite skepticism, leading tech firms including
OpenAI remain committed to major spending on AI advancements.
Meanwhile, OpenAI plans a new, free ChatGPT version, maintaining high
spending levels alongside ambitious AI projects like Stargate.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 HIGH-FIDELITY SIMULTANEOUS SPEECH-TO-SPEECH TRANSLATION (30 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Kyutai has released an amazing audio system which is a real time,
audio to audio, translation system. It is built on a powerful multi
stream transformer and boasts expressive voice ability. 

 INTERACTION PROCESSING UNITS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article explores the development of computer hardware based on
Interaction Nets, a computational model that represents calculations
as interacting graph nodes. While current implementations like HVM
show promise for parallel processing, traditional hardware isn't
optimized for graph-based operations. The author proposes that custom
hardware architecture could better utilize Interaction Nets' inherent
parallelism and local memory access patterns, particularly benefiting
algorithms with non-homogeneous parallelism like optimization problems
and graph processing. 

 MLLM'S FACE UNDERSTANDING BENCHMARK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FaceXBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs face
understanding across 14 tasks in 6 key categories. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DEEPSEEK RELEASES VL2, A SERIES OF MOE VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB
REPO) [10] 

 DeepSeek-VL2 introduces a new series of Mixture-of-Experts
Vision-Language models with up to 4.5B activated parameters that excel
in tasks like OCR, visual grounding, and chart understanding. 

 COLQWEN 2 (HUGGING FACE HUB) [11] 

 A new vision based retrieval model based on Qwen that blew away state
of the art for later interaction document retrieval. 

 CONTROLLING GENERATED LENGTH IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The "Ruler" method helps LLMs generate responses of a specific
length. It improves models' ability to follow length constraints in
user instructions using Meta Length Tokens. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 CONTROLLING AI'S GROWING ENERGY NEEDS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI model training requires significant energy, with LLMs like GPT-3
consuming vast amounts. Alternatives such as neuromorphic and optical
computing are being explored to reduce this footprint. Meanwhile,
smaller fine-tuned models are emerging as an energy-efficient option
for specific applications. 

 AI MEMORY AND CONTEXT: OPEN SOURCE, DEEPSEEK, META, AND MODEL
RESEARCH (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Yann LeCun emphasizes that true AI intelligence requires a system of
interconnected components rather than a single powerful model,
highlighting the need for persistent memory and context. He calls for
new AI architecture, possibly through "world models," to better mimic
human cognition. LeCun also advocates for open-source AI development
to advance the field. 

 AI HATERS BUILD TARPITS TO TRAP AND TRICK AI SCRAPERS THAT IGNORE
ROBOTS.TXT (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nepenthes, a malicious AI tarpit inspired by anti-spam techniques,
was created to trap and poison AI crawlers ignoring robots.txt,
raising operational costs for AI companies. Developer Aaron's tool
disrupts AI training by feeding bots gibberish, with only OpenAI's
systems reportedly escaping its grasp. While some criticize its
efficacy, Nepenthes symbolizes resistance against unchecked AI
scraping, sparking similar tools like Iocaine designed to protect
online content.

 COPYRIGHT OFFICE OFFERS ASSURANCES ON AI FILMMAKING TOOLS (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The U.S. Copyright Office clarified that AI-assisted creations can
still qualify for copyright protection, provided they involve human
authorship. 

 CUSTOMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR AI FEATURE (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Research by Irrational Labs found labeling products as "AI" doesn't
increase trust, justify higher prices, or improve performance
expectations. 

 OPENAI INKS DEAL WITH LOS ALAMOS LAB TO CRAM O1 INTO VENADO (3 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 OpenAI partnered with Los Alamos National Laboratory to deploy its o1
LLM on the Venado supercomputer for nuclear security and scientific
advancements.
