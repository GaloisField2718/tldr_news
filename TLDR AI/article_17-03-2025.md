HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE ASSISTANT IS REPLACED BY GEMINI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google Assistant is transitioning into Gemini, a more personalized
and AI-driven assistant designed to integrate with apps and services
while leveraging generative AI. 

 GOOGLE'S RESPONSE TO U.S. AI POLICY (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google outlines its vision for U.S. AI policy, advocating for
investments in AI infrastructure, streamlined government adoption, and
international pro-innovation standards to maintain leadership in the
AI space. 

 SAKANA CLAIMS ITS AI-GENERATED PAPER PASSED PEER REVIEW (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Japanese AI startup Sakana used its AI Scientist-v2 to generate a
paper accepted at an ICLR workshop but withdrew its post-initial
review due to transparency concerns. Though Sakana highlights AI's
potential, critics argue that human judgment was crucial and
acceptance was facilitated by higher workshop acceptance rates.
Skeptics remain wary, emphasizing AI's technical flaws and the need
for established norms to prevent degrading the scientific review
process.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TRANSFORMERS WITHOUT NORMALIZATION (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most Transformer models are normalized with a layer norm. This can be
seen as equivalent to normalizing the model to a sphere. However, if
you use carefully placed tanh functions, you can eliminate layer norm
while maintaining stability. This is now equivalent to normalizing to
a hypercube. 

 SCALING LAWS FOR DILOCO (35 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepMind has released a paper detailing scaling laws for the powerful
cross data center training algorithm DiLoCo. These show how stable
model training can be even with gradients synchronized across
continents. 

 SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION WITH WHISPER (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 WSI repurposes the Whisper ASR encoder for multilingual speaker
identification using joint loss optimization. It outperforms Pyannote,
ECAPA TDNN, and Xvector in recognizing speakers across diverse
languages and environments.

 LUMA'S NEW PRE-TRAINING METHOD FOR MULTI-MODAL MODELS (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Luma Chief Scientist Jiaming Song, who created the earliest
accelerated algorithm for diffusion models, has unveiled Inductive
Moment Matching (IMM)—a new multi-modal pre-training method that
surpasses diffusion models with superior sample quality and 10x
greater efficiency. 

 THUNDERKITTENS ON BLACKWELL (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ThunderKittens is a powerful and simple abstraction for writing
efficient and performance CUDA kernels. This post explores how to use
the framework for the newest Blackwell series of GPUs from Nvidia. The
main difference is thinking in terms of data flow. 

 ARE OPEN MODELS REALLY OPEN? (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Many AI models labeled as "open" come with restrictive licensing
terms. Google's new Gemma 3 models and similar releases from Meta
raise concerns about commercial limitations, potentially impacting
smaller companies relying on these technologies.
