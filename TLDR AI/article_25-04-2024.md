HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE RELEASES OPENELM (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has released OpenELM, a family of eight open-source LLMs
designed to run efficiently on a single device for text generation
tasks with parameter sizes ranging from 270 million to 3 billion. 

 ERIC SCHMIDT-BACKED AUGMENT, A GITHUB COPILOT RIVAL, LAUNCHES OUT OF
STEALTH WITH $252M (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI-powered coding platform Augment has launched from stealth with
$252 million in funding, valuing the company near $977 million.
Founded by ex-Microsoft developer Igor Ostrovsky, the platform aims to
enhance software quality and productivity using advanced AI models.
Augment plans to offer standard SaaS subscriptions and expects to
reveal pricing details later this year ahead of its GA release. 

 SAKANA RELEASES JAPANESE IMAGE MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sakana AI's EvoSDXL-JP is a high-speed image generation model
optimized for Japanese language prompts that utilizes an evolutionary
model merging method. EvoSDXL-JP boasts tenfold faster inference
speeds and superior performance compared to existing models. It is
ideal for educational use in Japan to demonstrate the benefits of
generative AI.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PROBES CATCH SLEEPER AGENTS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sleeper Agents are language models that have been trained to perform
malicious actions when prompted with a certain set of wake words.
Probing language models with simple linear heads and the prompt ‚Äúare
you going to do something dangerous?‚Äù gives extremely reliable
detection of these previously hidden malicious actors. 

 REAL-TIME CHARACTER CONTROL (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A character control framework has been introduced that leverages
motion diffusion probabilistic models to produce a variety of
high-quality animations that respond instantly to dynamic user
commands. 

 DIFFUSION-BASED SUPER RESOLUTION (26 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CutDiffusion is a new approach that transforms low-resolution
diffusion models to meet high-resolution needs without the
complexities of traditional tuning.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BITBLAS: OPTIMIZED KERNELS FOR 1.58 BIT NET (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Microsoft has released a set of GPU accelerated kernels for training
BitNet style models. These models have substantially lower memory cost
without much drop in accuracy. 

 CORENET (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Apple has released a neural network training library along with a set
of models called OpenELM which are optimized to run on devices. 

 MAXTEXT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MaxText is a high performance, highly scalable, open-source LLM
written in pure Python/Jax and targeting Google Cloud TPUs and GPUs
for training and inference.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE BIGGEST OPEN-SOURCE WEEK IN THE HISTORY OF AI (9 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The last week of March 2024 marked a significant moment in
open-source large language models (LLMs) with multiple notable
releases, including DBRX by Databricks, Jamba by A21 Labs, and
Samba-CoE by SambaNova Systems. These launches signify a pivotal
moment in the diversification and proliferation of accessible and
decentralized AI models. The trend reflects a narrowing performance
gap between open-source LLMs and their closed-source counterparts,
indicating a vibrant future for AI innovation and enterprise adoption.


 GENERATIVE A.I. ARRIVES IN THE GENE EDITING WORLD OF CRISPR (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Profluent, a Berkeley startup, has used generative AI technology to
create new gene editors based on CRISPR. The company has used one of
the AI-generated gene editors to edit human DNA, but it has yet to put
any of them through clinical trials. While Profluent plans to open
source the gene editors generated by its AI technology, it will not be
open sourcing the AI technology itself. The project is part of a wider
effort to build AI technologies that improve medical care. 

 FLEXAI LAUNCHES TO DELIVER UNIVERSAL AI COMPUTE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 FlexAI launched with $30 million in seed funding led by Alpha
Intelligence Capital, Elaia Partners, and Heartcore Capital. The
company is rearchitecting compute infrastructure to deliver universal
AI compute: effective and seamless infrastructure needed to propel
advancements in artificial intelligence. FlexAI's cloud service,
launching later this year, enables developers to utilize heterogeneous
compute architectures to build and train AI applications reliably and
efficiently.
