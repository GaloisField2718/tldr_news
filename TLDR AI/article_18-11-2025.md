HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK 4.1 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grok 4.1 is the top model on LMArena. xAI touted its large-scale
post-training infrastructure as responsible for targeted improvements
to emotional intelligence and creative writing, which suggests it is
pursuing consumer-focused AI companion use cases currently dominated
by ChatGPT. 

 ARM CUSTOM CHIPS GET A BOOST WITH NVIDIA PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Arm-based Neoverse CPUs can now be paired with Nvidia's GPUs using
Nvidia's NVLink Fusion technology. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are
all developing or deploying Arm-based CPUs in their clouds. The
partnership will make it easier for customers of both companies to
pair hardware together. The announcement signals that Nvidia has
decided to open up its NVLink platform instead of forcing customers to
use its CPUs.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CUDA, SHMUDA: RUNNING ALPHAFOLD ON A MACBOOK AIR (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple's MLX framework is great for science workloads because it was
designed from the ground up to take advantage of Apple's unified
memory architecture. Models like AlphaFold are memory-intensive, and
almost all protein software is heavily optimized for CUDA. This post
shows how a developer got AlphaFold to run on an Apple M chip machine.
ARM chips like the Apple M are extremely fast and use only a fraction
of the wattage that a single CUDA card needs, and getting a Mac device
is a lot easier than getting a Blackwell GPU. 

 ROADMAP FOR VIDEO-BASED WORLD MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This roadmap outlines the progression of video generation systems
into full-fledged simulators that combine internal physics-aware world
models with visual rendering. It defines four developmental stages
toward interactive and stochastic virtual environments. 

 RL IS EVEN MORE INFORMATION INEFFICIENT THAN YOU THOUGHT (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 It takes way more FLOPs to get a single sample in RL than it does in
supervised learning. RL requires unrolling a whole thinking trajectory
tens of thousands of tokens long to get a single reward signal at the
end. In pretraining, you get a signal on every single token you train
on. For most of training, the information density per sample is way
lower for RL compared to supervised learning. 

 THE AGENT LABS THESIS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Agent Labs primarily research and sell agents. They put product first
and use outcome-based pricing, as opposed to Model Labs, which put
models first and price per token. Agent Labs have better cashflow
economics, but it might take longer to see exit valuations. The Model
Lab mission may be shifting, at least until the next big algorithm
shift.

 WEATHERNEXT 2: OUR MOST ADVANCED WEATHER FORECASTING MODEL (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 WeatherNext 2 is an AI model that delivers efficient, accurate, and
high-resolution global weather predictions. It can generate forecasts
with a resolution of up to an hour. The model's forecast data has been
released. WeatherNext 2 will be integrated to help power weather
information in Google Maps in the coming weeks. 

 BUILD A GPT-5.1 CODING AGENT (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This guide walks through building a coding agent using GPT-5.1 and
the Agents SDK, leveraging tools like shell execution, patch editing,
web search, and Context7 MCP for live documentation access. 

 INTELLIGENCE PER WATT: MEASURING INTELLIGENCE EFFICIENCY OF LOCAL AI
(30 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Frontier models today are served through massive, centralized cloud
computing services that are straining electric grids. The performance
gap between these large models and much smaller models, the kind that
can run on a phone or laptop, is shrinking.

 AA-OMNISCIENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AA-Omniscience is a benchmark for knowledge and hallucination across
more than 40 topics. It punishes hallucinations by deducting points
when models guess rather than admitting they do not know the answer.
The benchmark complements the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index
by incorporating the measurement of knowledge and probability of
hallucination. This thread contains the benchmark results from testing
cutting-edge models against AA-Omniscience. 

 REPLICATE IS JOINING CLOUDFLARE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Replicate, a platform for running AI models, is joining Cloudflare.
Existing Replicate users will be able to continue work without
interruption. Existing Workers AI users will soon receive a massive
expansion of the model catalog and the new ability to run fine-tunes
and custom models directly. Cloudflare's AI Gateway will provide users
with a single control plane for observability, prompt management, A/B
testing, and cost analytics across all of their models, whether
they're running on Cloudflare, Replicate, or any other provider.
