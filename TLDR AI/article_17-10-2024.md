 SLOW MODELS = DEAD PRODUCTS ☠️ GET FASTER INFERENCE WITH BASETEN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 15 years ago, Amazon found that every 100 milliseconds of latency
cost 1% of revenue. Today, 100 ms kills entire products.

That's why startups building real AI-native applications (not GPT
wrappers) turn to Baseten for applied performance research,
distributed GPU infrastructure, and hands-on support.

phone calls while scaling usage over 50x
 	* Find out how Writer serves custom 70B parameter LLMs [6] at 60%
higher tokens per second and 35% lower cost per million tokens
 	* Try Baseten for yourself [4] with free model inference credits and
on-demand H100 access

✅ Descript, Patreon, and Rime chose Baseten for mission-critical AI
inference workloads.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL INTRODUCES ADVANCED EDGE MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mistral introduced two new cutting-edge models for on-device and edge
computing - Ministral 3B and Ministral 8B - on the first anniversary
of Mistral 7B. These models excel in knowledge, reasoning, and
efficiency for sub-10B tasks. They support up to 128k context length
and feature faster inference. 

 META AI'S NEW TRACKING MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CoTracker is a new tracking model that addresses the performance gap
between synthetic and real video data by using semi-supervised
training. 

 FORMER PALANTIR CISO DANE STUCKEY JOINS OPENAI TO LEAD SECURITY (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI hired former Palantir CISO Dane Stuckey to strengthen its
security operations. The company seeks to enhance its AI security
infrastructure and has been working with the Pentagon on
cybersecurity-related projects. OpenAI aims to build secure AI systems
while exploring government partnerships including with the U.S.
Department of Defense. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CONTINUOUS-TIME CONSISTENCY MODELS (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This study proposes a unified framework to improve training stability
in continuous-time consistency models to significantly advance
generative model performance. 

 ENHANCED POINT CLOUD REGISTRATION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Researchers introduce a new consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer
for more efficient and accurate point cloud registration. 

 BRAIN SIGNALS DECODING (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DARNet is a novel model for auditory attention detection (AAD) that
enhances the decoding of brain signals like EEG by incorporating
spatiotemporal and dual attention mechanisms. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TURN IDEAS INTO FLASK APPS WITH NO-CODE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Ditto is a no-code tool that transforms natural language descriptions
into multi-file Flask applications. It automates much of the coding
process using a simple LLM loop, helping users create functional web
apps from their ideas. 

 TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYSTEM (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 F5-TTS is a non-autoregressive, zero-shot text-to-speech system that
uses a flow-matching mel spectrogram generator and a diffusion
transformer. Built on the MLX framework, F5 improves on previous
systems like E2 TTS by using ConvNeXT v2 blocks for better text
alignment, producing high-quality speech in around 11 seconds on
modern hardware. 

 LONG-CONTEXT HANDLING FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 DuoAttention is a framework designed to reduce memory and latency in
long-context LLMs by selectively applying full KV caching to only
essential attention heads.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN AI REALLY COMPETE WITH HUMAN DATA SCIENTISTS? OPENAI'S NEW
BENCHMARK PUTS IT TO THE TEST (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's MLE-bench tests AI capabilities in machine learning
engineering through 75 Kaggle-style competitions. The benchmark
highlights AI progress but also its limitations in creative
problem-solving compared to humans. Open-sourcing MLE-bench could
standardize AI evaluation and impact the role of data scientists. 

 SB 1047: OUR SIDE OF THE STORY (21 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 California's proposed SB 1047 aimed to mandate AI companies to
mitigate existential risks but was vetoed by Governor Newsom, who
cited inadequate regulation of smaller, potentially dangerous models.
The bill had significant backing from AI safety advocates like Dan
Hendrycks and garnered support from notable figures such as Elon Musk,
yet faced opposition from major AI corporations including OpenAI and
Google. Newsom's veto has stirred debates among AI professionals about
future regulatory frameworks and potential alliances with broader
political groups to address AI safety comprehensively. 

 OVERVIEW OF STRONG HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AMPLIFICATION METHODS (15
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI advancements hinge on creating humans with enhanced cognitive
capabilities to navigate AGI development effectively. Methods include
brain emulation, genomic approaches, adult brain gene editing, and
brain-brain interfaces, each with unique challenges and risks. These
efforts aim to solve philosophical problems, amplify human
intelligence to unprecedented levels, and address potential AGI
threats.
