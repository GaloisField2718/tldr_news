 HOW ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE TURNED CARSALES' AI AMBITIONS INTO
PRODUCTION REALITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI projects fail not because of the algorithms, but because of
engineering practices. carsales discovered this when building their AI
Model Finder - a vehicle recommendation tool that suggests cars based
on lifestyle needs and preferences.

Working with Thoughtworks [4], they transformed their development
processes first: implementing Test-Driven Development, refining team
dynamics, and establishing clear deployment pipelines. As a result,
their AI initiative delivered faster time-to-market, reduced risk, and
higher ROI.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE CODE AND ADMIN CONTROLS FOR ENTERPRISE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has expanded its enterprise offering with Claude Code,
bundled under premium seats for business plans. 

 GEMINI LIVE: A MORE HELPFUL, NATURAL, AND VISUAL ASSISTANT (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google added real-time visual guidance to Gemini Live that highlights
objects on-screen when using the camera along with deeper integration
across the Google Suite. The update includes more expressive speech
patterns that can adapt tone based on context and take direction on
pace or accent, closing the gap between Google's voice capabilities
and fast-growing voice AI startups. 

 CHARACTER.AI EXPLORES SALE OR NEW FUNDING AMID RISING COSTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Character.AI has been holding discussions with possible buyers,
banks, and staff over the past few weeks about raising a few hundred
million dollars at a valuation of more than $1 billion. The startup's
founders left the company last September to join Google, leaving
employees to take over ownership. If sold, the buyer would get
Character.AI's app and website, which hosts chatbots that resemble
anime characters, celebrities, and historical figures. Character.AI
makes most of its revenue by charging for premium features with its
chatbots. It expects to reach $50 million in annualized revenue by the
end of the year.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CHEAP RL TASKS WILL WASTE COMPUTE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI labs will soon favor quality over quantity when procuring RL
environments and spend a surprisingly large amount of money on
procurement per RL task. Procuring RL tasks cheaply results in lower
quality training runs, and the compute cost per RL run soon becomes
very high. AI labs will increasingly move away from training on
procedurally generated RL tasks and tasks produced cheaply by massive
numbers of low-paid contractors toward a more labor-intensive build
process that relies on full-time domain experts who spend months
developing sustained context and crafting individualized tasks. The
winners will be those who deliver the highest-quality, context-rich
tasks, ship them rapidly, and price them efficiently given compute
tasks. 

 WITHOUT AI, US CAPEX WOULD BE IN A SLUMP (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Data center construction contributed as much to GDP growth as
consumer spending in the first half of 2025, a historic shift given
that consumer spending typically represents 70% of economic activity.
AI infrastructure spending masked what would have been a -1.5% GDP
contraction in Q1. AI-sensitive sectors have driven 53% investment
growth since 2019 compared to flat performance elsewhere. 

 BEST PRACTICES FOR BUILDING AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS: WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS
IN PRODUCTION (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UserJot's founder argues for a strict two-tier architecture with
stateless subagents that act as pure functions: no memory, no
conversation history, just task-in-result-out. MapReduce patterns
handle large-scale work through parallel execution, which keeps
individual agent tasks under 30 seconds and prevents the debugging
nightmares that plague complex hierarchies and shared state systems.

 SCRIPT TYPE="TEXT/LLMS.TXT" (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Most systems rely on external documentation or pre-configured
knowledge to instruct AI agents when they hit protected pages, but it
would be simpler to have the instructions right there in the HTML
response. llms.txt is an emerging standard for making content such as
docs available for direct consumption by agents. This post proposes a
convention to include such content directly in HTML responses. It is
designed to fit right in with llms.txt, which has found adoption for
publishing LLM-targeted content in a discoverable fashion on the web. 

 HEALTHCHAIN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 HealthChain connects AI models to any healthcare system with just a
few lines of Python. It makes integrating AI with electronic health
records automatic, fast, and easy. The HealthChain API provides a
secure integration layer that coordinates multiple healthcare systems
in a single application. Developers can use it to build pipelines for
NLP and ML tasks that easily integrate with complex healthcare
systems. 

 TIKTOK PARENT COMPANY BYTEDANCE RELEASES NEW OPEN SOURCE SEED-OSS-36B
MODEL WITH 512K TOKEN CONTEXT (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ByteDance's Seed Team of AI researchers today released Seed-OSS-36B
on Hugging Face. Seed-OSS-36B is a new line of open source, large
language models designed for advanced reasoning with both synthetic-
and non-synthetic-data variants and an instruct model. The
synthetic-data variant is intended as a higher-performing
general-purpose option, while the non-synthetic model avoids potential
bias or distortion introduced by synthetic instruction data. The
instruct model is post-trained with instruction data to prioritize
task execution and instruction following. The models were released
under the Apache-2.0 license, which allows free use, modification, and
redistribution by researchers and developers working for enterprises.

 Google Photos will soon support natural language photo editing,
starting with Pixel 10 users in the US. Users can describe edits via
voice or text, and see AI-powered changes applied automatically. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH CLAUDE AND HUGGING FACE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hugging Face now enables users to generate images with Claude by
integrating with Spaces and recently released models. This guide
explains how to set up the workflow and highlights models tuned for
natural scenes and text-rich visuals.
