HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

STABLEVIDEO: EDIT VIDEOS USING DIFFUSION METHODS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/rese1f/stablevideo?utm_source=tldrai]

While diffusion methods are great for creating images and videos, they
have a hard time editing videos without changing how objects look over
time. StableVideo uses a special technique to make sure edited objects
look consistent throughout a video. 

SNAP IS LAUNCHING A NEW GENERATIVE AI FEATURE, DREAMS (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/snapchat-is-expanding-further-into-generative-ai-with-dreams/?utm_source=tldrai]

Snap is launching Dreams, a way to place pictures of you in
fantastical places and scenarios using selfies and AI. 

EARLY DAYS OF AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.eladgil.com/p/early-days-of-ai?utm_source=tldrai]

This current era of LLMs, Transformers, and diffusion models is
completely different from any prior AI period.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

TOWARDS CREATIVE CHESS WITH ALPHAZERO (31 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09175?utm_source=tldrai]

Another cool games paper from Deepmind. The researchers try to improve
their AlphaZero chess playing agent to reduce hallucination and
improve broad creativity. They find that the types of moves it plays
are more diverse and can solve really challenging positional puzzles.
Interesting to see how it works out long term. 

ENHANCING CHATBOTS' ROLE-PLAYING ABILITIES (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09597v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Chatbots that act like fictional characters are gaining popularity,
but current methods need refining for better imitation. This study
presents a new algorithm using improved prompts and character memories
from scripts.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

INTRODUCING RLIPV2: A BETTER LANGUAGE-VISION MODEL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jacobyuan7/rlipv2?utm_source=tldrai]

RLIPv1 is a method that helps computers connect what they see in
images to descriptive words, but it has some problems, especially with
being slow and lacking data. This new paper introduces RLIPv2, a
faster version that uses a new tool (ALIF) to better merge images and
words. It also has a new way to get more descriptive data from images.


OPENPIPE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenPipe is a flexible playground for comparing and optimizing LLM
prompts. It lets you quickly generate, test, and compare candidate
prompts, and can automatically translate those prompts between models.


MINIMAL ML FRAMEWORK IN RUST (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/huggingface/candle?utm_source=tldrai]

HuggingFace released a neat little ML framework in Rust that is
lightning fast and supports a number of powerful models.

USING AN RNN FOR 2D GAME TILE SYNTHESIS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://voxely.net/blog/using-a-rnn-for-2d-tile-map-synthesis/?utm_source=tldrai]

A fun blog about creating game assets using a classic AI technique.
There are lots of good tidbits here around dataset curation,
hyperparameter optimization, and human based evaluation. Could be cool
to expand this with SDXL pixel LoRAs and truly synthesize maps from
scratch. 

I MADE STABLE DIFFUSION XL SMARTER (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://minimaxir.com/2023/08/stable-diffusion-xl-wrong/?utm_source=tldrai]

In this article, Max Woolf breaks down how he made the newest version
of Stable Diffusion better by training it on bad AI-generated images. 

WHAT CAN FETISH RESEARCH TELL US ABOUT AI? (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/what-can-fetish-research-tell-us?utm_source=tldrai]

There are parallels between human fetish formation and AI alignment
challenges, suggesting that understanding how misinterpretations of
evolutionary cues lead to fetishes might offer insights into AI
generalization problems. The article explores the potential for this
analogy to inform AI training and interpretability, acknowledging the
differences between biological evolution and AI programming.
