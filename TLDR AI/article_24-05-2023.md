ANTHROPIC‚ÄôS $450M SERIES C (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropic-series-c?utm_source=tldrai]


In what feels like the 450 millionth round of funding, Anthropic
closes a similarly sized check. The main use for this funding will be
to bring their products to market. Having gone through the same safety
to product transition as OpenAI, we'll now see if they can continue to
stick to their original mission. 

BING CHAT COMES TO WINDOWS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2023/05/23/bringing-the-power-of-ai-to-windows-11-unlocking-a-new-era-of-productivity-for-customers-and-developers-with-windows-copilot-and-dev-home/?utm_source=tldrai]


Plugins allow AI systems to use tools and interact with digital
systems. This ability is now coming to Windows with first and third
party copilot style plugins. There has yet to be a successful desktop
native copilot, but with the speed of execution we'll get to see this
first push to market.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LONG AWAITED RWKV PAPER (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048?utm_source=tldrai] 

Transformers displaced recurrent neural networks as the primary tool
for most text based tasks. However, these Transformers are expensive
and limited in context due to the architecture. RWKV is an attention
variant (vaguely reminiscent of linear attention) that claims to have
the best of both Transformers and recurrent models. The Discord is
quite active, but there hasn't been a formal write up of this hyped
model. This paper is the first to explain the model in depth. 

ARE SAFETENSORS REALLY SAFE? (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.eleuther.ai/safetensors-security-audit/?utm_source=tldrai]


Safetensors is a library that avoids many of the pitfalls of loading
arbitrary binary files (pkl) from the internet. Specifically, loading
a pretrained model can give attackers access to run arbitrary code.
Thankfully, Safetensors alleviates this issue and allows secure
sharing of tensor style artifacts with unknown actors. 

VIDEOLLM: A TOOL FOR VIDEO ANALYSIS USING LLMS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/cg1177/VideoLLM?utm_source=tldrai] 

Leveraging the power of language processing models, the newly proposed
VideoLLM system converts all video inputs into a type of language that
can be analyzed more efficiently. By successfully testing on multiple
datasets, VideoLLM proves that it can handle various tasks, suggesting
that language model's reasoning abilities can be effectively used for
understanding and analyzing video content.

HOW ROGUE AIS MAY ARISE (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/05/22/how-rogue-ais-may-arise/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article discusses how rogue AIs can arise. The author argues that
the fastest route to a rogue AI system is if a human with the
appropriate technical skills and means intentionally builds it with
the objective of destroying humanity or a part of it set explicitly as
a goal. Still, a broader and less understood set of circumstances
could give rise to potentially rogue AIs, even if the humans making it
did not intend to design a rogue AI.
