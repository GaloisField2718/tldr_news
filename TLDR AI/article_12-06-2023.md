HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

META LEADS OPEN-SOURCE AI WITH NEW TEXT-TO-MUSIC MODEL (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/?utm_source=tldrai]

CEO Mark Zuckerburg recently discussed his goals with open-sourcing
significant expensive AI tools in a podcast. This collection of music
generation code, model weights, and evaluations is an example of just
that. It allows you to generate both melody conditioned and text
conditioned music. The code is fully open sourced, but model weights
are not commercially open. 

STABLE DIFFUSION TAKES STEREOTYPES TO THE EXTREME (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/2rW4q?utm_source=tldrai]

Bloomberg journalists found that Stable Diffusion takes racial and
gender disparities to extremes that are even worse than those found in
the real world, stroking fears that generative AI will perpetuate
biases. 

KHAN ACADEMY KHANMIGO (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/L7jLP?utm_source=tldrai]

Khan Academy has introduced an AI-powered chatbot, Khanmigo, which
aims to provide personalized tutoring to students. Powered by GPT-4,
the bot offers guidance on a broad range of subjects and uses the
Socratic method to encourage learners to solve their problems
independently. While proponents believe such bots could revolutionize
education, concerns about the technology's potential for error and
impact on teachers' roles persist and its effectiveness is currently
being studied ahead of a broader rollout in U.S. schools.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

NEW MULTIMODAL TEXT/VISION MODEL FROM SINGAPORE (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://otter-ntu.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

A lot of new acronyms are introduced in this work. The gist is that
researchers collected a new dataset for visual instruction tuning,
trained a model, and made some algorithmic tweaks along the way. The
demo is really impressive, especially after the AR reveal from Apple.
An exciting peak at what AI assistants might look like in the future. 

MAKING LANGUAGE MODELS MORE TRUTHFUL AT TEST TIME (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03341?utm_source=tldrai]

Language models are well known for confidently confabulating
(sometimes called hallucinating). It turns out that these models have
an internal representation for truthfulness and by tweaking the model
activations you can elicit a truthful response. The researchers found
that by using this technique on the instruction-tuned Alpaca model,
they improved TruthfulQA performance from 32.5% to 65.1%. 

SPQR: A TECHNIQUE FOR HIGH-EFFICIENCY LLM COMPRESSION (19 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03078v1?utm_source=tldrai]

The paper presents Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new
format and technique that allows almost lossless compression of large
language models (LLMs), overcoming the usual accuracy losses from
quantization. SpQR enables powerful LLMs to run on common devices like
laptops and mobile phones without performance degradation, offering
over 4x memory compression gains and faster inference than traditional
methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

MATTE ANYTHING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/hustvl/Matte-Anything?utm_source=tldrai]

Advances in computer vision seemed to slow after autonomous vehicle
research lost some steam, but things are picking up again. This novel
technique uses a hydra of three image models to enhance the
performance of natural image matting. The results are quite
compelling. 

BREAKTHROUGH IN DENSE PIXEL WISE TRACKING, EVEN WITH OCCLUSIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [https://omnimotion.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

In 2015, there was a breakthrough in representing continuous values
with a 6D number. This work rhymes in that they propose representing
videos as a 3D volume. By matching between that representation and
pixel space, they can perform quite long term tracking of arbitrary
pixels in a video. 

LANARKY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ajndkr/lanarky?utm_source=tldrai]

Lanarky is an open-source framework to deploy LLM applications in
production.

LLMS ARE GOOD AT PLAYING YOU (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/llms-are-better-than-you-think-at?utm_source=tldrai]

An exploration into the eerie human-like features of LLMs and how they
hold promise for some fields and trouble for others. 

CONGRESS TO CONSIDER TWO NEW AI BILLS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/7nnwl?utm_source=tldrai]

U.S. senators introduced two separate bipartisan artificial
intelligence bills on Thursday amid growing interest in addressing
issues surrounding the technology. One would require the U.S.
government to be transparent when using AI to interact with people and
the other would establish an office to determine if the United States
is remaining competitive in the latest technologies.

CHATGPT ONLY KNOWS 25 JOKES (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/researchers-discover-that-chatgpt-prefers-repeating-25-jokes-over-and-over/?utm_source=tldrai]

Two German researchers, Sophie Jentzsch and Kristian Kersting,
released a paper that examines the ability of OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 to
understand and generate humor. They discovered that ChatGPT's
knowledge of jokes is fairly limited: During a test run, 90 percent of
1,008 generations were the same 25 jokes. 

HEY, ALEXA, WHAT SHOULD STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT AI? (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/w4oeZ?utm_source=tldrai]

Tech giants, universities, and nonprofits are working to provide
lessons on artificial intelligence to students in schools. There is
currently no national consensus on what should be taught about the
technology. Current curriculums cover a range of topics, from the
basics of AI to how to program Alexa.
