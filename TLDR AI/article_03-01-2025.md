HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S MISSED OPT-OUT TOOL DEADLINE (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI faced criticism for not delivering the promised opt-out tool
by its deadline, raising concerns over user data practices and
transparency. 

 CODE ASSIST, GOOGLE'S ENTERPRISE-FOCUSED CODING ASSISTANT, GETS
THIRD-PARTY TOOLS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google announced third-party tool support for Gemini Code Assist,
enhancing its AI code completion capabilities. The tools, available in
private preview, connect Code Assist to external applications,
increasing productivity and minimizing context switching. Initially,
tools are limited to Google Cloud partners, with offerings from
GitLab, GitHub, and others at launch.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 AN ANALYTIC THEORY OF CREATIVITY IN CONVOLUTIONAL DIFFUSION MODELS
(21 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A fascinating paper that explores closed form equations that can
model generated images from diffusion models. This means that with a
high degree of confidence you can predict the image that will be
generated, in a simpler setting. 

 CENTAUR: A FOUNDATION MODEL OF HUMAN COGNITION (45 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have trained a language-like model that can predict
cognitive reactions in human participants better than an MRI. This can
be used to continue study in behavioral science and neuroscience. 

 PARALLEL GENETIC ALGORITHM (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This study suggests a method for reconstructing the genetic operation
and designing a development framework for efficient parallel
acceleration. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DYNAMIC 3D GAUSSIAN TRACKING FOR GRAPH-BASED NEURAL DYNAMICS MODELING
(GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 This code uses advances in general 3D vision techniques to improve
the niche of robot vision. Specifically, it can predict the dynamics
of objects being manipulated by a robotic arm which then in turn
improves the system's overall manipulation performance. 

 PROCESS REINFORCEMENT THROUGH IMPLICIT REWARDS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 There are very few promising open replications of o1 reasoning. This
work is quite promising in that it uses implicit rewards that don't
require a formal reward method or model, but also rewards the outcome
which is inline with what we know about reasoning models. The code is
in progress, but its developers have released the data and models. 

 SINGLE MODALITY 3D OBJECT DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository contains a 3D object detection framework designed for
single modality inputs, particularly catering to simplified and
efficient scenarios. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 A VIDEO-LANGUAGE ASSISTANT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A conditional diffusion model integrating visual and textual inputs
designed to generate high-quality images conditioned on diverse
text-visual contexts. 

 HUMAN PREFERENCE LEARNING FOR VIDEO GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VisionReward is a fine-grained and multi-dimensional reward model. 

⚡ 

QUICK LINKS

 WONDERFUL MATRICES (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A collection of diverse matrix operations implemented efficiently,
useful for mathematical and scientific computing tasks. 

 CHATTIME (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An interactive chat-based application that integrates time-tracking
features, simplifying task management for teams and individuals. 

 VISION FOUNDATION MODEL FOR REMOTE SENSING (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CrossEarth is the first vision foundation model aimed at generalizing
across diverse remote sensing scenarios.
