HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

OPENAI LAUNCHES SUPERALIGNMENT TEAM (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment?utm_source=tldrai]

How do you align a model much smarter than humans? OpenAI has been
working on this question across teams for some time, but now they're
bringing 20% of the entire org (compute-wise) to bear on this
challenge. They're hiring extensively and many top scientists
internally are working on this problem. 

PLAYGROUND AI RAISES $40M FOR IMAGE EDITING (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-raises-40m-to-advance-the-field-of-computer-graphics/?utm_source=tldrai]

The popular AI powered image editing suite raised money to continue
pushing forward text driven creativity expressed via pixels.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

1 BILLION TOKENS IN CONTEXT (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486?utm_source=tldrai]

It seems like dilated attention now finally works! This is an exciting
advancement if it holds at scale, because it means that we can
essentially treat entire corpi of documents as context. All of the
Python code on GitHub is only a few hundred billion tokens. LongNet is
a linear attention variant, but they seem to have stabilized training,
and it doesn‚Äôt sacrifice performance on shorter sequences. 

ENHANCED VISION-LANGUAGE ZERO-SHOT LEARNING (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00862v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This study presents a technique that improves AI's understanding of
image-text tasks by focusing on fine details and keywords, enhancing
performance, especially when faced with unseen scenarios. 

KOSMOS-2 CHECKPOINTS RELEASED (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/kosmos-2#checkpoints?utm_source=tldrai]

One of the top multimodal models today was developed by the UniLM team
at Microsoft. They have now released demo code, weight checkpoints,
and more for you to play with and integrate into your systems.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

NEW VECTOR DATABASE, WRITTEN WITH METAL SHADERS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/sdan/vlite?utm_source=tldrai]

There's a lot of excitement around using vector databases to augment
the memory of different language models. This vector database has a
simple interface and is primarily used for ChatGPT plugins. It runs
many times faster than competitors while maintaining simplicity. It
doesn't have the bells and whistles of many other offerings, but it
performs the task well for plugins. 

EFFICIENT NIGHTTIME UAV TRACKING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/vision4robotics/sam-da?utm_source=tldrai]

This research introduces SAM-DA, a new system that improves real-time
tracking of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at night. By using the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate detailed training samples
from limited nighttime images, it significantly enhances the tracking
ability while using fewer resources. 

WEBGLM: A COST-EFFECTIVE ONLINE Q&A TOOL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/thudm/webglm?utm_source=tldrai]

WebGLM is a new online tool powered by artificial intelligence
designed to answer questions by searching the web and providing the
most relevant information. It improves upon previous models by
offering increased accuracy and efficiency, and studies show that it
performs as well as, if not better than, more complex systems.

MISCELLANEOUS

LINEAR ATTENTION FOR NLP (40 MINUTE VIDEO)
[https://youtu.be/dKJEpOtVgXc?utm_source=tldrai]

State-space, RWKV, and other non-quadratic methods have emerged
recently as potential replacements for Attention. This video walks
through several of these methods, how they're compared to one another,
and how to reason about the current research direction. 

PLAYING WITH STREAMLIT AND LLMS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://lethain.com/streamlit-llms/?utm_source=tldrai]

If you‚Äôre doing anything with generative AI and playing internally
with your own LLMs, you should check out this post about Streamlit. 

CELEBRITIES USE AI TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN IMAGES (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/nMjbV?utm_source=tldrai]

Celebrities are partnering with brands to create AI-generated
duplicates of themselves that can be used in marketing campaigns. This
gives celebrities more control over their own images and allows brands
to use the stars in ways they never could before.

NANOT5 (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/PiotrNawrot/nanoT5?utm_source=tldrai]

We‚Äôve covered this in previous newsletters, but it just got an
upgrade. Inspired by Andrej‚Äôs great NanoGPT repo, the NanoT5 repo
can train a model to equivalent T5 paper performance 150x faster.
It‚Äôs definitely worth checking out if you care about training models
from scratch. 

THE MANY WAYS THAT DIGITAL MINDS CAN KNOW (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/?utm_source=tldrai]

Ryan Moulton discusses the various methods through which digital minds
can acquire knowledge, such as direct programming, machine learning,
simulation, and training. 

AI WEIGHTS ARE NOT OPEN ‚ÄúSOURCE‚Äù (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-06-27-ai-weights-are-not-open-source/?utm_source=tldrai]

The article explores the issue of AI model weights and their
availability as open-source. It argues that while the source code of
AI models may be open, the weights‚Äîwhich contain the actual learned
knowledge‚Äîare typically not shared openly due to various reasons
such as intellectual property concerns, privacy, and commercial
interests.
