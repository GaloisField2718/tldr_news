 ANTHROPIC'S RED TEAM WARNS OF AI SECURITY RISKS (7 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI models are rapidly advancing in cybersecurity and biology,
approaching expert-level knowledge in some areas. While current risks
remain manageable, the company warns that stronger safeguards will be
needed as capabilities progress. 

 GOOGLE'S AI HEALTH INNOVATIONS ANNOUNCED AT THE CHECK UP 2025 (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google highlighted how AI is driving health advancements globally,
from diagnostic tools to research collaborations, at The Check Up
2025. The company aims to enhance medical accessibility and improve
patient outcomes through AI-driven innovations. 

 INSIDE ZOOM'S AI EVOLUTION: FROM BASIC MEETING TOOLS TO AGENTIC
PRODUCTIVITY PLATFORM POWERED BY LLMS AND SLMS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Zoom is expanding beyond video conferencing by developing an agentic
AI infrastructure that transforms meetings into action-oriented
workflows. This includes AI Companion 2.0, with features like task
management and document creation, and customized AI agents via the new

 A novel approach to integrate knowledge into an LLM without
retraining, enabling online and realtime learning. 

 THE KOLMOGOROV TEST: COMPRESSION BY CODE GENERATION (27 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Meta has introduced a new benchmark for testing a language model's
reasoning and knowledge. The test presents the language model with a
long sequence of data and requires the model to output the shortest
program that regenerates the sequences and halts. This is known as
Kolmogorov compression and is uncomputable in polynomial time. The
test requires strong reasoning abilities. 

 MEASURING AI ABILITY TO COMPLETE LONG TASKS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new “mores law” for agents' task horizon ability shows that the
length of tasks an agent can complete has been doubling every 7
months. This suggests that in the next two years, agents will be able
to complete multi-hour-long tasks with many complicated steps.
