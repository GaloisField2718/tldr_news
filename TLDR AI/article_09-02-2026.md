 WELO DATA: HUMAN JUDGMENT AS AI QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Human judgment breaks down without systems, and AI quality follows.
Welo Data [4] provides the scaffolding that both humans and AI need to
practice robust evaluation at scale. 

That includes continuous quality monitoring, structured QA loops, and
auditability with traceability.

What does it look like in practice [4]?

 	* 150M+ tasks processed annually
 	* 90%+ evaluator consensus
 	* 90%+ audit accuracy
 	* 0 security incidents
 	* 622% throughput scaling without quality loss

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN BUILDING WITH A 2.5X-FASTER VERSION OF CLAUDE
OPUS 4.6 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is making a faster version of Claude Opus 4.6 available as
an early experiment via Claude Code and its API. Fast mode is more
expensive to run, but it is 2.5x faster. It is designed for urgent,
high-stakes projects. A link to the waitlist for the feature is
available in the thread. 

 META AI READIES AVOCADO, MANUS AGENT, AND OPENCLAW INTEGRATION (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta AI is reportedly preparing to release new models named Avocado.
It is also adding MCP support and a Memory section to its settings
menu. Meta AI has revamped its website to include a lot of additional
functionality. The company appears to be working on an AI agent and a
browser agent, and a new feature called Tasks that will allow users to
schedule recurring executions of Meta AI. 

 NVIDIA BECOMES FIRST $5T COMPANY; AI CHIPS FUEL MARKET VALUE (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nvidia achieved a historic milestone by briefly surpassing a $5
trillion market valuation, driven by overwhelming demand for its AI
chips and dominance in data-center accelerators. Its advanced
Blackwell and Rubin GPU platforms power the bulk of large-model
training and inference workloads, underpinning investor confidence in
continued AI infrastructure growth. This valuation reflects Nvidia's
central role in the AI economy and illustrates how hardware leadership
translates to extraordinary market value.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SELF-DRIVING CODEBASES WITH THOUSANDS OF AGENTS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cursor scaled a system where thousands of agents collaboratively
coded a functioning web browser with minimal human input, highlighting
progress toward autonomous software development. 

 OPEN MODELS WILL NEVER CATCH UP (42 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Open models will probably never catch up with closed ones. However,
they don't need to - open models are an engine for exploration in a
way that companies can't really nurture. Open models are the main
place where experimentation still happens. They will be the engine for
the next ten years of AI research. 

 THE LIMIT IN THE LOOP: MEMORY AS A SYSTEM PROBLEM (8 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Weaviate discusses the limitations of current LLM applications rooted
in session-based design, arguing that solving continuity—carrying
context across interactions—requires systemic rather than
model-level changes. 

 WORLD MODELS AND THE DATA PROBLEM IN ROBOTICS (17 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 World models are trained to predict how the world evolves. They
enable generalization that pure action prediction cannot achieve.
Combining world models with robotics could create robots that can do
everything humans can do. However, this will require a lot of data
captured by real people.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 LEARNING FROM CONTEXT IS HARDER THAN WE THOUGHT (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The role of humans in AI systems will shift if context learning
improves significantly. Humans would focus on context engineering
rather than primarily providing training data. Once this is achieved,
we then need to focus on making context persistent. 

 MONTY (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Monty is a minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use
by AI. It lets users safely run Python code written by agents. Monty
completely blocks access to the host environment, and it can only call
functions it has access to. It makes it possible to safely run
LLM-generated code without the complexity of a sandbox or the risk of
running code directly on the host. 

 DFLASH SPEEDS UP SPECULATIVE DECODING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DFlash is a lightweight block diffusion model designed to accelerate
speculative decoding in LLMs that achieves up to 6x speedup for
Qwen3-8B.

 G'S LAST EXAM (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The profession of software engineering has forever changed, but it is
still unknown what role humans will exactly play. This post presents a
list of the most ambitious and creative software accomplishments by
humans. A world in which agents autonomously solve these challenges
would be equal parts humbling, exciting, and unsettling. 

 DO MARKETS BELIEVE IN TRANSFORMATIVE AI? (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Transformative technologies influence interest rates by changing
growth expectations, increasing uncertainty about growth, or raising
concerns about existential risk. There were economically large and
statistically significant movements concentrated at longer maturities
for US bond yields around major AI model releases in 2023 and 2024.
These movements correspond to downward revisions in expected
consumption growth and/or a reduction in the perceived probability of
extreme outcomes. It appears the markets do not believe in
transformative AI. 

 THE ANTHROPIC HIVE MIND (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While every company quickly becomes professional and 'grown up',
Anthropic still hasn't bothered. It isn't run like any other company
of its size. The company's employees describe the company as a hive
mind run entirely on vibes. This article takes a look inside one of
the leading AI labs, examining the company's culture, history, work
style, and more.

QUICK LINKS

 EXPERTS HAVE WORLD MODELS. LLMS HAVE WORD MODELS (18 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 LLMs struggle in adversarial environments because they generate
outputs based on static models rather than adaptive world models. 

 LLMS COULD BE, BUT SHOULDN'T BE COMPILERS (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Large language models can translate a specification into an
executable artifact, but the control relinquished in that translation
layer is significant. 

 THOUGHTS ON CLAUDE'S CONSTITUTION (14 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Claude's Constitution is the foundational framework from which
Claude's character and values emerge. 

 LORA BUT WITH ONLY 13 PARAMETERS?? (6 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Meta researchers say they can boost an LLM's math reasoning by
updating just 13 parameters. 

 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IS UNDERGOING A RENAISSANCE IN FRONT OF OUR EYES
(3 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Adopting AI coding tools requires a deep cultural change that
requires companies to figure out a lot of downstream implications. 

 THE GENTLE OBSOLESCENCE (10 MINUTE READ) [24] 

 AI is becoming more and more capable, and this may make humans
obsolete.
