HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI AND JOURNALISM (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI addressed The New York Times lawsuit by emphasizing
collaboration with news organizations, claiming that AI training with
public content is fair use, committing to eliminating rare content
regurgitation in their models, and expressing surprise over the
lawsuit, given their ongoing efforts to address concerns. 

 GETTY AND NVIDIA BRING GENERATIVE AI TO STOCK PHOTOS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Getty Images and Nvidia have enhanced their AI collaboration with the
launch of Generative AI by iStock, a platform for creating stock
photos tailored for small and medium businesses that uses Nvidia's
Picasso model and trained on Getty and iStock libraries. 

 MICROSOFT IS ADDING A COPILOT KEY TO KEYBOARDS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new Copilot key, the first big change to the Windows PC keyboard
layout in nearly three decades, will ship on a variety of new PCs and
laptops from Microsoft‚Äôs partners, providing quick access to
Microsoft‚Äôs AI-powered Windows Copilot experience straight from a
keyboard button press.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPSEEK PAPER (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the best coding models of last year was the DeepSeek LLM. It
got close to GPT-3.5 on many benchmarks (even if it is likely 3x the
size). Information about model training, token counts, model
architecture, and more has been released in a technical report. 

 DENOISING VISION TRANSFORMERS (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vision Transformers (ViT) have taken over the vision community. They
still sometimes display grid-like artifacts in their embeddings. This
has made the community hesitant to adopt them for downstream tasks.
This work proposes an update to the positional embeddings that
eliminates this issue and gives a 25%+ boost for downstream vision
tasks. 

 4D FACE VIDEO EDITING (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a face video editing architecture that
combines GAN-NeRF technology for 3D consistency and a novel stabilizer
for smooth temporal coherence. This method excels in editing videos by
maintaining consistent views and seamless transitions between frames.

 LLM GATEWAY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Portkey AI recently open sourced its gateway, which allows for
routing between many different language models. 

 ALOHA CODE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The ALOHA robotics system took the internet by storm with its
incredible cooking and household task demonstration. It uses a number
of interesting training techniques (mostly imitation learning). This
repository contains some baseline training algorithms for the ALOHA
system in simulation. 

 CREWAI AUTONOMOUS AGENT ORCHESTRATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 CrewAI is a platform for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI
agents aimed at enhancing collaborative intelligence and enabling
these agents to work together effectively in complex tasks. It
provides a structure for sophisticated multi-agent interactions and is
designed for various applications, including smart assistant platforms
and automated customer service.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INTEGRATING CLIP AND SAM FOR ENHANCED IMAGE SEGMENTATION (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This project introduces the Open-Vocabulary SAM, a framework that
combines the strengths of CLIP and SAM models for improved image
segmentation and recognition. 

 THE NEW YORK TIMES‚ÄôS AI OPPORTUNITY (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft claims that
their AI technologies, including ChatGPT, were trained using millions
of the newspaper's copyrighted articles, leading to AI-generated
outputs that compete directly with the Times' services. The lawsuit
seeks billions in damages and the destruction of AI models and data
that used the Times' content, arguing that this constitutes copyright
infringement and undermines the newspaper's investment in journalism,
raising significant questions about the legalities of AI training
practices and the impact of AI on traditional content creators. 

 DIFFUSING INTO THE FUTURE: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH DIFFUSION
MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 How diffusion models advance RL. This repository categorizes their
applications and points towards future interdisciplinary research
opportunities.
