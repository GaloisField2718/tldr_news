 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION — AGENTS, INTEGRATIONS,
WORKFLOWS, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to become part of your organizational DNA - and that
means enabling every department to build out their own use cases,
without IT gatekeepers standing in the way. But it shouldn't mean an
ungoverned free-for-all.

Airia is the “let's get serious about AI adoption” platform [4].
Rapidly prototype, deploy, and manage AI agents that transform
workflows across your organization - without sacrificing security or
governance.

Connect to dozens of enterprise applications with native integrations.
Build agents quickly with templates and no-code tools [4]. Let
everyone build with AI while maintaining visibility and control.

Plans start at just $49/month. Get a demo [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE HAIKU 4.5 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's new small model delivers Claude Sonnet 4 performance at
one-third the cost and twice the speed. Haiku 4.5 enables new
multi-agent workflows where Sonnet 4.5 orchestrates teams of Haiku
models working in parallel. 

 GOOGLE VEO 3.1 (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has introduced Veo 3.1 with improved audio output, better
prompt adherence, and more realistic video generation. The update
enhances Google's Flow editor with new capabilities like object-level
control, image-to-video blending, and audio-enabled video extensions. 

 NVIDIA, MICROSOFT, XAI, AND BLACKROCK PART OF $40 BILLION DEAL FOR
ALIGNED DATA CENTERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock, and xAI will acquire Aligned Data
Centers for $40 billion, marking the largest global data center deal.
The acquisition is AIP's first investment and aims to support AI
infrastructure expansion. The deal is expected to close late next
year, pending regulatory approvals.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ARTISANAL SHIMS FOR THE BITTER LESSON AGE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most
effective by a large margin. Developers building and working with AI
applications should be aware that the artisanal architecture they are
building may become obsolete with the next model release. They should
make a note of what is not scaling with compute and focus their
artisanal ingenuity there. Custom architectures may be necessary for
many applications, but build them with the knowledge that they may
have to be thrown away when the next frontier model drops. 

 WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A CHATGPT MOMENT YET IN MANUFACTURING (28
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The software that manages the mathematical definitions in CAD
software is called a geometry kernel. Whoever first develops a truly
capable foundational AI model for CAD will control a critical layer of
industry infrastructure. The problem is that this critical
infrastructure layer is currently monopolized by a handful of players
whose business depends on maintaining closed, proprietary systems. If
the US wants to maintain its industrial competitiveness, it must
recognize geometry kernels as strategic infrastructure, not just
commercial software products. The market has had decades to produce an
open alternative and hasn't, so a coordinated public investment may be
justified. 

 PREPARING FOR AI'S ECONOMIC IMPACT: EXPLORING POLICY RESPONSES (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic gathered policy ideas from economists and experts to
prepare for modest to dramatic job losses due to AI. Concrete
proposals include $10,000 annual employer training grants, "token
taxes" on AI-generated content, and sovereign wealth funds that give
citizens stakes in AI revenues. 

 MORE ARTICLES ARE NOW CREATED BY AI THAN HUMANS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Analysis of 65,000 web articles found AI-generated content surpassed
human-written articles in November 2024, growing from near-zero to 39%
within 12 months of ChatGPT's launch before plateauing since May 2024.
The authors speculate the stagnation was due to poor SEO performance,
but they were unable to measure the prevalence of AI-generated,
human-edited articles.

 VERBALIZED SAMPLING: HOW TO MITIGATE MODE COLLAPSE AND UNLOCK LLM
DIVERSITY (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI models collapse into repetitive, generic responses because human
annotators systematically prefer familiar answers during training.
This "typicality bias" explains why ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini all
tell the same coffee joke. The solution is simple: prompt models to
"generate 5 jokes with their corresponding probabilities." This
"verbalized sampling" method increased creative diversity by roughly
2x and improved human evaluation scores by 26% across tasks from story
writing to social simulation.

 ORACLE CO-CEOS DEFEND MASSIVE DATA-CENTER EXPANSION, PLAN TO OFFER AI
ECOSYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Oracle plans to offer computing firepower and a suite of bundled
services that will make artificial intelligence useful for business.
Investors have expressed concerns about how its newest deals rely
heavily on OpenAI, which won't generate a profit until 2029. Oracle's
long-term play is to sell an ecosystem of AI solutions to large
enterprises. The company has taken on debt to finance its AI
infrastructure build-out, further troubling investors. However, the
company has a more varied business than many realize - pretty much all
of the big model providers use its cloud in one form or another. 

 HOW STARCLOUD IS BRINGING DATA CENTERS TO OUTER SPACE (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Starcloud, under NVIDIA Inception, plans to launch AI-equipped
satellites to establish data centers in space, aiming for 10x lower
energy costs and higher sustainability. Its 5-gigawatt orbital center
will leverage solar energy and space's vacuum for cooling, conserving
Earth's resources. This approach offers faster processing for
applications like wildfire detection and Earth observation, utilizing
NVIDIA's advanced GPUs for real-time data inference. 

 META AND ARM TEAM UP ON AI INFRASTRUCTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta is migrating its AI ranking and recommendation systems to Arm's
Neoverse platform as part of a multi-year partnership aimed at scaling
AI infrastructure. The deal focuses on energy-efficient cloud AI
deployments, without involving ownership stakes or shared physical
assets.
