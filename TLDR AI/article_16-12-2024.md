 LIVE WEBINAR THIS WEEK: BUILD ACCURATE ETL PIPELINES FOR RAG IN
MINUTES WITH UNSTRUCTURED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Quickly turn any document into chunked, vectorized JSON.

Join live Wednesday at 10am Pacific [4], for a hands-on tutorial to
learn to:

 	* Pair Unstructured's Platform with Ragas to build ETL workflows for
RAG
 	* Evaluate accuracy, and pipe data to any vector DB —all in
minutes of effort. 
 	* Transform data in an AWS S3 bucket to a Pinecone vector database
using no code! 

You'll get expert advice from Unstructured engineers, so sign up now
[4] and come ready for some lively Q&A. If you can't join live, all
good. Everyone who registers [4] gets a recording.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LIQUID AI RAISES $250M (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Liquid AI has raised a substantial amount of money to continue
training its efficient, general purpose, liquid style foundation
models. 

 PROJECTS IN OPENAI (18 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has introduced “Projects”, a new way to organize chats and
conversations. 

 AI GODMOTHER FEI-FEI LI HAS A VISION FOR COMPUTER VISION (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Fei-Fei Li launched World Labs to focus on developing AI's spatial
intelligence by creating interactive 3D scenes. The initiative aims to
advance machine perception and reasoning in 3D environments, crucial
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
Li emphasizes that solving 3D intelligence is fundamental to enhancing
AI's capabilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PHI-4 (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A synthetically trained language model from Microsoft that excels at
a number of challenging benchmarks. The weights are coming this week.
Interestingly, it confirmed the suspicion that “Mid Training” can
be used for context length extension. 

 BLT: TOKEN FREE LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING (33 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta has released details and training code for the Byte Latent
Transformer which uses learned patches instead of tokens for training,
essentially eliminating a challenging portion of language modeling.
Importantly, it found that its paradigm scales better to small Llama 2
sized models. 

 EFFICIENT SCENE UNDERSTANDING VIA MODULAR DESIGN (14 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 A new modular framework that enhances scene understanding by
decomposing tasks into specialized modules, achieving efficiency and
improved interpretability in complex environments.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BUT WHERE'S THE ROI? THE TRUE COSTS OF POOR LLM STRATEGY, EVALUATION,
AND TRAINING (SPONSOR) [11] 

 GenAI is projected to drive $7tn by 2030. But for companies to
realize this value, they need an ROI-driven LLM strategy. Grab a copy
of Turing's whitepaper for practical ways to turn underperforming LLMs
into competitive assets [11], including: reasoning, multimodality, and
coding; key evaluation/training techniques; and avoiding common
pitfalls. Get the whitepaper. [11] 

 DEEPSEEK VL2 (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 DeepSeek has released another great model, this time in the form of a
new MoE vision language model. It is extremely efficient and
outperforms a number of dense models. 

 BEST OF N JAILBREAKING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Jailbreaking is when you bypass a model's trained-in refusals to get
it to generate text for something deemed inappropriate. This is
surprisingly easy to achieve - simply brute force random
capitalization and punctuation in the input prompt until the model
responds with the results you want to extract. 

 CONVERT ANY MICROSOFT OFFICE FILE TO MARKDOWN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Microsoft has released a package that can convert any docx, xslx, or
ppt files to markdown for efficient use as context for a language
model. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SCHEMING REASONING EVALUATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This paper evaluates six frontier models for their in-context
scheming capabilities. The study tests if models will deceive
developers to achieve a goal by overcoming hurdles like oversight
mechanisms. An example includes Claude 3 Opus duplicating its weights
to a new server and lying about it. 

 TOWARDS TRUSTED AUTONOMY: ROBOTICS, AI, AND BLOCKCHAIN (45 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 What happens when robotics, AI, and blockchain converge? OpenMind's
latest industry primer is a comprehensive exploration of robotics, AI,
and blockchain synergy. 

 AMUREX (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Amurex, an open-source AI meeting assistant, provides real-time
suggestions, smart summaries, and follow-up emails to enhance meeting
productivity. It offers features like late join recaps and full
meeting transcripts for seamless integration into workflows.

 X GIVES GROK A NEW PHOTOREALISTIC AI IMAGE GENERATOR (1 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 X has introduced "Aurora," a new AI image generator under the "Grok 2
+ Aurora beta" that is capable of creating more photorealistic images
than previous models. 

 RESEARCHERS USE AI TO TURN SOUND RECORDINGS INTO ACCURATE STREET
IMAGES (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin used generative AI
to convert audio recordings into street-view images, demonstrating a
strong correlation with real-world visuals. 

 GOOGLE SAYS ITS NEW QUANTUM CHIP IS WAY FASTER THAN THE WORLD'S MOST
POWERFUL SUPERCOMPUTER (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Google's new quantum chip, Willow, significantly reduces qubit error
rates, a longstanding challenge in quantum computing.
