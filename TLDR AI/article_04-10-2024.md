 STATE OF TRUST IN AI: HOW TO PROVE TRUST IN AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In an era where AI is rapidly transforming industries, building trust
with potential buyers and sellers has become paramount. How can AI
companies demonstrate trust and ensure their security practices are
robust, secure, and aligned with the highest standards?

Watch our fireside chat [4] with two AI companies, Factor and
Stravito, where their security leaders discuss how their organizations
leverage security best-practices and compliance with AI frameworks
such as ISO 42001 and NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) [5] to
demonstrate trust in their AI practices.

 OPENAI'S ORIGINAL SIN (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Recent departures of senior executives at OpenAI highlight ongoing
internal conflicts between prioritizing product development and
revenue versus research and safety. These issues stem from the
company's foundational promise to develop AGI for the benefit of all
humanity, which has proven challenging amidst financial and strategic
pressures. OpenAI is negotiating a $6.5 billion funding round with
conditions that could transform it into a for-profit entity. 

 THE ART OF THE OPENAI DEAL (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI's revenue surged to $300M in August. The company is projecting
$3.7B in annual sales for this year and $11.6B for next year, but it
faces a $5B annual loss. Its rapid growth was fueled by the popularity
of ChatGPT, which accounts for most of its revenue. Despite the
growth, OpenAI is seeking more investors due to high operational costs
and to evolve into a profitable entity. 

 WHAT COMES AFTER? (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Californian Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed the state's SB 1047
bill, which aimed to regulate large AI models. He emphasized the need
for evidence-based regulations and warned against overly stringent

science-based guidelines with experts like Dr. Fei-Fei Li.
