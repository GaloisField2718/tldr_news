GOOGLE PARTNERS WITH AI STARTUP REPLIT TO TAKE ON MICROSOFT‚ÄôS GITHUB
(2 MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/Qr11g?utm_source=tldrai] 

Google is teaming up with Replit to combine its AI language models
with Replit's Ghostwriter software, which helps programmers write
code. This collaboration aims to compete with Microsoft's GitHub
Copilot, which uses OpenAI's language-generating AI. Ghostwriter will
use Google's AI to improve code suggestions, program completion, and
answering developer questions. Replit plans to enhance its software by
offering end-to-end support for code writing, testing, deployment, app
review, and collaboration. The partnership will also see Replit expand
its use of Google's cloud services and distribution of its software. 

OPENFLAMINGO (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://laion.ai/blog/open-flamingo/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Last year Deepmind published research on their Flamingo model which is
a powerful multi-modal text and vision model. This model could answer
questions about images while still being a powerful text model. Laion
has now released a framework for training Flamingo models and a 9B
parameter checkpoint trained on 5M samples of the Multimodal C4
dataset and 10M samples from LAION-2B image dataset. The model is not
usable for commercial applications as it uses the 7B Llama checkpoint
from Meta. It also doesn‚Äôt yet match Deepmind‚Äôs Flamingo on
benchmark performance. 

PERPLEXITY AI SERIES A (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.perplexity.ai/blog?utm_source=tldrai] 

One of the startup leaders in AI enabled search has launched an iPhone
app and raised additional funding. They‚Äôre aiming to be the leader
in knowledge discovery. We‚Äôll see which of these services find
differentiation, but the 2 million users in just a few months is
impressive growth.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

CHATGPT IS THE NEW MTURK (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15056?utm_source=tldrai] 

NLP needs data, this data is usually labeled by crowdsourced workers
on various platforms. It turns out, maybe unsurprisingly, that
gpt-3.5-turbo is extremely good at following instructions for labeling
and often outperforms human annotators on relevance, stance, topic,
and other important measures. Even more importantly, it also costs
much less (about 20x) than hiring human annotators. 

EVA-CLIP: IMPROVED TRAINING TECHNIQUES FOR CLIP AT SCALE (7 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15389?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper introduces EVA-CLIP, a set of models that significantly
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CLIP training. EVA-CLIP
achieves superior performance compared to previous models with the
same number of parameters but smaller training costs, and the complete
suite is released for open research. 

UNRAVELING IMAGEN: ZERO-SHOT CLASSIFICATION SHOWDOWN (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15233?utm_source=tldrai] 

Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model, rivals CLIP in zero-shot
classification, outperforming in shape/texture bias tests and
suggesting generative pre-training as a valuable approach in
vision-language tasks.

ANTI-DREAMBOOTH: PROTECTING USERS FROM PERSONALIZED TEXT-TO-IMAGE
SYNTHESIS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/VinAIResearch/Anti-DreamBooth?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper discusses how text-to-image diffusion models, like
DreamBooth, can generate realistic images from simple text inputs, but
can also be misused to produce fake news or disturbing content
targeting individuals. The paper proposes a defense system called
Anti-DreamBooth that adds subtle noise perturbations to user images to
disrupt the generation quality of any DreamBooth model trained on
them, and evaluates its effectiveness against a wide range of
algorithms on various text-to-image model versions. 

TEXT2VIDEO-ZERO, A ZERO-SHOT TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/Text2Video-Zero?utm_source=tldrai]


This paper introduces a low-cost approach for zero-shot text-to-video
generation by modifying existing text-to-image synthesis methods. The
method enriches latent codes with motion dynamics and reprograms
frame-level self-attention to preserve the context, appearance, and
identity of the foreground object, resulting in high-quality and
consistent video generation without additional video data. The
approach is also applicable to other tasks such as conditional and
content-specialized video generation and instruction-guided video
editing.

ANOTHER LLM FINE-TUNING FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.stochastic.ai/blog/introducing-xturing-fast-efficient-and-simple-finetuning-for-llms?utm_source=tldrai]


Fine-tuning large language models on your own data gets easier every
day, but it still is a somewhat challenging systems problem. xTuring
is another approach to simplify the process for people interested in
using some of the ‚Äúopen‚Äù models on your custom data. 

CHATGPT GETS A COMPUTER (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://stratechery.com/2023/chatgpt-learns-computing/?utm_source=tldrai]


In the article, the author discusses the development and capabilities
of AI assistants like ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, and their
differences from traditional deterministic computers. AI assistants,
which are more human-like in their way of thinking and communicating,
are evolving with the addition of plug-ins, such as Wolfram|Alpha, to
provide more accurate and real-time information. The author
acknowledges the potential benefits and risks of AI, emphasizing that
the intentions of the humans who wield AI will ultimately determine
the outcomes, and argues that we should push for positive outcomes
where AI significantly improves life.
