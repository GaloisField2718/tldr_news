SELF TRAINING SURVEY (31 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12040?utm_source=tldrai] 

Semi supervised and self supervised learning is where machine learning
models generate the training signal. This is different from standard
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The objective
function is usually data specific (e.g. masking words or rotating
images). This is a good study on common techniques used and open
problems in the space. 

IMPROVED IMAGE SEARCH USING CLIP AND CAPTIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ABaldrati/CLIP4Cir?utm_source=tldrai] 

This project introduces a method to search for images that look like a
given picture but with changes described in a caption. It used a CLIP
model with added special techniques. The method works better on
popular image search datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR.

BETTER TEXT-TO 3D MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/buaacyw/it3d-text-to-3d?utm_source=tldrai] 

Scientists have found a new way to turn text into 3D using special
techniques, but sometimes the results aren't perfect. IT3D introduces
a smart strategy that uses multiple viewpoints and a special training
system to make 3D creations look more realistic. 

BETTER TRACKING IN VIDEOS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/holmescao/TOPICTrack?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have made a new system called TOPIC that can track
