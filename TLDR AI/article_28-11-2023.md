HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMAZON AND SALESFORCE EXPAND PARTNERSHIP TO ADD NEW AI CAPABILITIES
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Salesforce and Amazon Web Services have significantly expanded their
partnership to make it easier for customers to manage data across both
platforms and integrate generative AI technologies into their
applications and workflows. 

 TESLA STARTS RELEASING TO EMPLOYEES FSD V12 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tesla has started releasing its Full Self-Driving v12 update to
employees. The biggest difference with the update is how vehicle
controls will be taken over by neural nets rather than being
hard-coded by engineers. Tesla may be able to push the update to
customers by the end of the year. Elon Musk has previously said that
he believes that Tesla will achieve true self-driving capability by
the end of the year. 

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE 2.1 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude 2.1, the updated AI model from Claude, now offers a 200K token
context window and a 2x decrease in false statements. The model also
introduces a beta feature, tool use, allowing Claude to integrate with
users' existing processes and APIs. The update seeks to increase
trust, reliability, interoperability, and cost efficiency in AI
applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 STARLING-7B: INCREASING LLM HELPFULNESS & HARMLESSNESS WITH RLAIF (12
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A group of researchers at Berkeley trained a new state-of-the-art 7B
parameter model using synthetic preference data. This blog talks about
the novel challenges of training reward models (e.g., the position of
the example in the list changes its ranking) and how they overcame
them. The resulting model is available along with the trained reward
model. 

 360-DEGREE PANORAMIC IMAGING USING CIRCULAR BLENDING TECHNIQUE
(GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Researchers have devised a unique circular blending method to address
the longstanding challenge of creating seamless 360-degree panoramic
images. This technique is a key feature in their innovative models for
generating panoramic images from text and single images. 

 IMAGE-TO-PAINTING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new technique for transforming images
into paintings that mimic human-like quality and style.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 INSANELY FAST WHISPER WITH SPEAKER DIARIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A somewhat opinionated CLI tool for transcribing audio files. It also
now includes speaker segmentation and diarization (e.g., recognizing
speaker 1 vs speaker 2). The claim is they can transcribe 2.5 hrs of
audio in 100s, even on some of the largest models available. 

 AGENCY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Library designed for developers to explore the potential of LLMs and
other generative AI through a clean, effective, and Go-idiomatic
approach. 

 IMPROVING INSTRUCTION QUALITY BY COACHLM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 CoachLM introduces a novel AI technique to refine instruction
datasets for LLMs. This method uniquely improves datasets by revising
rather than removing low-quality samples, significantly elevating the
effectiveness of instruction-following in LLMs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPLORING THE GROWING CONVERGENCE BETWEEN BLOCKCHAIN AND AI (20
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This report, which polled 600+ IT executives from around the world,
digs into the primary drivers behind the ever-growing appetite for AI,
the most popular use cases, and the primary hurdles hindering broader
adoption. Notably, it also debunks the notion that blockchain and AI
are not complementary technologies. 

 GOD HELP US, LET‚ÄôS TRY TO UNDERSTAND AI MONOSEMANTICITY (11 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Researchers from Anthropic have developed a method to interpret the
complex workings of AI by simulating a larger AI within a smaller one,
revealing that AI neural networks can encode information in a
sophisticated manner, akin to superposition in physics. By applying
this technique to a simple AI, they discovered that it could represent
distinct concepts, like "God", in individual features, and they
speculate that the same approach might reveal deeper insights into
both artificial and biological neural systems, potentially leading to
more efficient and safer AI development. 

 REBUILDING ORGANIZATIONS FOR AI (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The integration of AI in organizations is transforming traditional
work processes, enabling teams to work more efficiently by automating
tasks and decision-making. As AI evolves rapidly, it's crucial for
organizations to adapt by encouraging team experimentation with AI,
preparing for future advancements, and acting swiftly to stay
competitive.
