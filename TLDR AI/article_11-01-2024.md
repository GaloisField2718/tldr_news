paid by building these agents. The company plans to feature GPTs every
week. 

 REGULATORS AREN‚ÄôT CONVINCED THAT MICROSOFT AND OPENAI OPERATE
INDEPENDENTLY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 European Union regulators are scrutinizing Microsoft's investment in
OpenAI under EU Merger Regulations, concerned about potential
antitrust risks and market distortion. Microsoft denies controlling
OpenAI, despite its $13 billion investment and having an observer role
on OpenAI's board. EU and UK authorities, along with the US FTC, are
investigating the implications of such partnerships on competition and
market dynamics.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 UNSLOTH ACCELERATED MODELS IN TRL (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unsloth is a lightweight library for speeding up language model
fine-tuning. It now works easily with TRL on common model
architectures. 

 MASKED AUDIO GENERATION WITH A SINGLE NON-AUTOREGRESSIVE TRANSFORMER
(18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most audio generation techniques use diffusion or an auto-regressive
model to generate sounds. This research doesn't use multi-steps or a
complicated Transformer. Instead, it uses a masked language model over
audio tokens. 

 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH GRAPH CONSTRUCTION WITH TECHGPT-2.0 (14 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 TechGPT-2.0 enhances large language models for specific tasks like
knowledge graph construction. The project, with its focus on named
entity recognition and relationship triple extraction, also marks a
significant stride in the Chinese open-source AI community.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DPO DATASET USING DISTILABEL (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A new method that enables filtering of high-quality pair preferences
for alignment. It improves baseline model performance by a substantial
amount. 

 CHATBOT UI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 An open-source repository that allows anyone to make a chat UI as
part of their application. 

 MAPAI COMPETITION FOR BUILDING SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 MapAI launches an AI competition focused on building segmentation
using aerial and laser data. This challenge, set for fall 2022 and
concluding at the Northern Lights Deep Learning conference, invites
participants to tackle two tasks: one using only aerial images and the
other incorporating LiDAR data.

 AI AND THE FUTURE OF SAAS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI is the juggernaut we all know and love these days. Its impact on
SaaS has yet to be determined, so how do you go about mapping a path
forward with a new or existing venture? Buckle up and give this a read
(or listen). 

 BENCHMARKING GPT-4 TURBO (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 GPT-4 successfully completed 70% of programming tasks, while GPT-4
Turbo trailed slightly at 68.8%. Interestingly, GPT-4 Turbo required
more second attempts, suggesting it might lack GPT-4's memorization
strength. This was confirmed by a subsequent test.
