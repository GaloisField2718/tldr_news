 THIS AI COMPANY IS PROMISING TO REVOLUTIONIZE RETAIL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Between soaring real estate prices, labor shortages, and shoplifting
retail stores struggling, VenHub [4]‚Äîwhich has opened its current
investment round [4] to the public‚Äîis developing a new way to cut
costs and increase efficiency with robotics.

VenHub Smart Stores use AI to operate fully autonomously 24/7 [4], [5]
anticipate inventory, and predict customer needs. They can fit nearly
anywhere and can be opened in just a week.

And with over $240 million in pre-orders [4] and over $2m raised, the
market seems to be more than on board. Are you?

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE'S UPGRADED AI IMAGE GENERATOR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has released Imagen 3, an advanced AI text-to-image generator,
through its AI Test Kitchen and the Vertex AI platform. Imagen 3 is
designed to produce images with enhanced details and lighting while
maintaining content guardrails to prevent the creation of certain
restricted imagery. Despite limitations, users have found ways to
depict characters and logos resembling copyrighted material. 

 RUNWAY'S GEN-3 ALPHA TURBO IS HERE AND CAN MAKE AI VIDEOS FASTER THAN
YOU CAN TYPE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Runway ML's new Gen-3 Alpha Turbo is now available, offering 7x
faster AI video generation at half the price of its predecessor across
various subscription plans, including free trials. This speed
advancement significantly reduces time lag, fostering more efficient
workflows, particularly for time-sensitive industries. Runway
continues to push for improvements, including enhanced control
mechanisms, while navigating the ethical landscape surrounding AI
training data practices.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPSEEK PROVER (27 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DeepSeek has produced an incredibly powerful math model that was
trained via process supervision and dramatically outperforms larger
models on various MATH benchmarks. 

 DIFUZCAM: REPLACING CAMERA LENS WITH A MASK AND A DIFFUSION MODEL (12
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This is a delightful project that uses a diffusion model to
reconstruct really low quality images from a cheap camera. 

 BAM DENSE TO MOE UPCYCLING (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This method allows dense models' FFN and Attention layers to be
upcycled into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model for further training.
This saves a dramatic amount of compute cost while maintaining
downstream performance.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HOW TO GIVE LLMS HUMAN-LIKE EVALUATION POWERS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 How do you know if your LLM output is any good? Human feedback is the
gold standard ‚Äî but it's expensive, slow, and inconsistent. This
webinar by Kolena [11] introduces cutting-edge techniques to fine-tune
LLMs according to the preferences of human raters. Join the live
session (September 4) for the best experience ‚Üí [11] 

 FUSECHAT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Fuse Chat is a way to combine multiple models together and allow each
to bring their strengths. This is the code base with model weights for
a number of strong 7B models that score high on MT bench. 

 BACKDOOR ATTACKS TO MEDICAL FOUNDATION MODELS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 BAPLe is a method for embedding backdoor attacks into medical
foundation models during the prompt learning phase. 

 VEHICLE MOTION PLANNING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 SigmaRL is an open-source, decentralized framework aimed at improving
the sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) in the motion planning of connected and automated
vehicles.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EVALUATING 3D RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY (36 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess how the
quality of 3D reconstructions impacts object pose estimation accuracy
in industrial applications. 

 AN AI EMPIRE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI advancements could make humanity second in intelligence on Earth.
AGI could be imminent with the possibility of replicating AI research
at an unprecedented scale. Exponential growth in computing hints at a
rapid transition to ASI, leaving humans vastly inferior. Society may
not be ready for such a profound shift, despite potential bottlenecks
in AI development. 

 WHAT DOES BITCOIN SMELL LIKE? AI STARTUP WANTS TO ‚ÄòTELEPORT'
DIGITAL SCENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Osmo, an AI startup, is developing technology to enable computers to
interpret and recreate scents, potentially aiding in disease detection
and digital scent transmission. Unlike audiovisual AI advances, scent
detection lacks a standardized "smell map," challenging the team to
establish a molecular bond scent database. Osmo's applications could
revolutionize medical diagnostics and digital marketing by
incorporating olfactory experiences.

 MULTIVIEW INPAINTING (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Multi view image synthesis is the task of creating new views from a
single image. 

 ERIC SCHMIDT WALKS BACK CLAIM GOOGLE IS BEHIND ON AI BECAUSE OF
REMOTE WORK (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has retracted his comments criticizing
Google's remote-work policy and its impact on AI competition with
OpenAI. 

 GEMINI ADVANCED UPDATED WITH LATEST 1.5 PRO MODEL FOR IMPROVED
REASONING (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google has enhanced Gemini 1.5 Pro in Gemini Advanced, delivering
improved responses for prompts requiring advanced reasoning and
coding.
