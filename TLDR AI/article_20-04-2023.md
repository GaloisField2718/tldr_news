HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

NEXT LEVEL TEXT-TO-VIDEO SYNTHESIS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/VideoLDM/?utm_source=tlrdai]


The recent progress in text to images was helped by using ‚Äúlatent‚Äù
diffusion where synthesis happens in a smaller space. This is cheaper
while still maintaining high quality generations. It turns out with a
few small tweaks this can also be applied to video generation. By
making sure the latent vectors are all related through time, you can
generate some amazingly consistent scenes. 

THE MAKERS OF STABLE DIFFUSION TRAINED SOME LANGUAGE MODELS
(HUGGINGFACE)
[https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models?utm_source=tldrai]


Trained for approximately 800B tokens now, with the goal to reach 1.5T
tokens, Stability AI‚Äôs new StableLM models are 3B and 7B parameters
and have a context length of 4k tokens. They are permissively licensed
and available for commercial use. They were trained on a modified
version of The Pile which will be released soon along with checkpoints
that are further along. They have ‚Äútuned‚Äù versions of these models
which use a variety of conversational and instruction datasets.
Interestingly, these tuned versions have system prompts, which makes
them one of the first open models to allow that sort of steering.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

TRANSFORMER MATH (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.eleuther.ai/transformer-math/?utm_source=tldrai] 

How many GPUs do you need? How wide should your model be? These are
regularly asked questions with fairly simple calculations. This post
walks through these and a bunch more interesting questions involving
Transformers and the math needed to train good ones. One interesting
take away is that models should not be trained for less than 200B
tokens regardless of size. 

VISUAL INSTRUCTION TUNING (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://llava-vl.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes using machine-generated instruction-following data
to instruction tune large language models (LLMs) for multimodal tasks.
This resulted in LLaVA, a large multimodal model that combines a
vision encoder and language-only GPT-4. LLaVA exhibits impressive
multimodal chat abilities and achieved a new state-of-the-art accuracy
of 92.53% when fine-tuned on Science QA in synergy with GPT-4. 

LOW-CODE LLM: VISUAL PROGRAMMING OVER LLMS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08103?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes Low-code LLM, a human-LLM interaction framework
that uses low-code visual programming interactions to achieve more
controllable responses for complex tasks. Low-code LLM includes a
Planning LLM and an Executing LLM and offers controllable generation
results and user-friendly interaction. The approach is demonstrated
through four applications.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

PROMPTR (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr?utm_source=tldrai] 

Promptr is a CLI tool for operating on your codebase using GPT.
Promptr dynamically includes one or more files into your GPT prompts,
and it can optionally parse and apply the changes that GPT suggests to
your codebase. Several prompt templates are included for various
purposes, and users can create their own templates. 

CLAP MODEL WEIGHTS RELEASED (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP#pretrained-models?utm_source=tldrai]


Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a model driving much
of the recent progress in image synthetics and understanding. A
similar Audio model CLAP was proposed recently and they just released
a set of pretrained model weights. 

LIFT3D: SYNTHESIZE 3D TRAINING DATA BY LIFTING 2D GAN TO 3D GENERATIVE
RADIANCE FIELD (GITHUB REPO)
[https://len-li.github.io/lift3d-web/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Lift3D, an inverted 2D-to-3D generation framework, addresses the
limitations of NeRF-based 3D GANs by offering photorealistic output
with adaptable resolution and accurate 3D annotations for downstream
tasks. The framework is evaluated on autonomous driving datasets,
demonstrating its ability to enhance the performance of 3D object
detectors.

JOHN SCHULMAN LECTURE: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK
(VIDEO)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhiLw5Q_UFg&ab_channel=BerkeleyEECS?utm_source=tldrai]


Berkeley alum, OpenAI cofounder, and Chief Architect of ChatGPT John
Schulman gives a lecture on the Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback work powering ChatGPT. Schulman says truthfulness is one of
the biggest problems in AI, and it turns out that reinforcement
learning is one of the biggest ways to fix it. 

90% OF MY SKILLS ARE NOW WORTH $0 (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/90-of-my-skills-are-now-worth-0?utm_source=tldrai]


In Kent Beck's blog post, he discusses how AI language models like
ChatGPT impact the software development industry. He believes that
while 90% of developers' skills have dropped in value due to
automation, there is an opportunity to leverage the remaining 10% in
new ways. AI tools can't replace human creativity and expertise, which
remain crucial for delivering high-quality software products. 

GPT-4 WILL HUNT FOR TRENDS IN MEDICAL RECORDS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/gpt-4-will-hunt-for-trends-in-medical-records-thanks-to-microsoft-and-epic/?utm_source=tldrai]


Microsoft and Epic Systems announced that they are bringing OpenAI's
GPT-4 AI language model into health care for use in drafting message
responses from health care workers to patients and for use in
analyzing medical records while looking for trends.
