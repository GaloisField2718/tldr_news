 AGENTIC AI IS CHANGING EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT PROCESS ORCHESTRATION
– LEARN HOW (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional automation is no match for today's complexity. Agentic
workflows [5]—autonomous, goal-driven agents collaborating to
achieve business goals—require more than prompt engineering. They
need a powerful workflow engine to orchestrate tasks, decisions, and
outcomes at scale—with humans in the loop when it matters most.
The latest webinar by Orkes [4] explored how combining agentic AI and
process orchestration [4] can enable businesses to integrate AI-driven
decision-making, streamline workflows, and scale with ease. Tune in to

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPMIND'S APPROACH TO AGI SAFETY (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google DeepMind outlines its perspective on building safe and secure
artificial general intelligence, emphasizing oversight and technical
safeguards as AGI capabilities progress. 

 OPENAI JUST MADE ITS FIRST CYBERSECURITY INVESTMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 OpenAI invested in Adaptive Security, a startup using AI to simulate
and train employees against social engineering hacks. Adaptive
Security secured $43M in Series A funding, with plans to bolster its
platform amid growing AI threats. Co-founded by veteran entrepreneur
Brian Long, the startup has quickly amassed over 100 clients since
launching in 2023. 

 OPENAI NONPROFIT GUIDANCE COMMISSION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is forming a new expert commission to shape how its
philanthropic arm supports communities using AI, aiming to align AI
innovation with real-world nonprofit needs.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ARTICULATED KINEMATICS DISTILLATION FROM VIDEO DIFFUSION MODELS (18
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This work introduces Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a
framework that leverages skeleton-based animation and generative
diffusion models to produce high-fidelity, physically plausible
character motions with reduced complexity. It ensures structural
consistency and outperforms existing methods in 3D coherence and
expressive motion quality by using Score Distillation Sampling to
guide joint-level control. 

 ENHANCED LORA-BASED FINE TUNING (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MetaLoRA introduces dynamic parameter generation using meta-learning
principles, enhancing the flexibility and task-awareness of LoRA-based
fine-tuning strategies. 

 BACKDOOR ATTACKS IN CLIP (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CLIP models are highly vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks,
achieving nearly 100% attack success with minimal poisoned data. An
efficient detection method is to use local outlier detection to
uncover unintentional backdoors in existing datasets.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 FLASH ATTENTION REIMAGINED WITH KVAX (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Nebius open-sourced Kvax: a JAX-based Flash Attention implementation
optimized for long-context training. Achieve faster, denser packing
and state-of-the-art performance with context parallelism and
efficient doc mask computation [12]—built by Nebius' AI R&D team.

 LARGE SMALL NET (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A new family of lightweight vision models inspired by the dynamic
heteroscale capability of the human visual system, i.e., "See Large,
Focus Small". LSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and
efficiency trade-offs across various vision tasks. It introduces a new
type of convolution kernel. 

 PPLX CUDA KERNELS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Perplexity has released some of its MoE kernels, which outperform
DeepSeek at scale while being slightly more flexible and less
opinionated about the MoE architecture. 

 HATEBENCH FOR EVALUATING HATE SPEECH (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 HateBench provides a framework for evaluating hate speech detection
models on LLM-generated content along with a manually annotated
dataset and code for analyzing adversarial and stealthy hate
campaigns. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 ZONOS TTS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A compelling Apache 2.0 model for speech generation and voice
cloning. It has multi language support and expressive real time
generation. 

 HUGGING FACE'S AI AGENTS COURSE (14 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Hugging Face released an AI agents course today. This free course
will take you on a journey, from beginner to expert, in understanding,
using, and building AI agents. 

 GOOGLE IS SHIPPING GEMINI MODELS FASTER THAN ITS AI SAFETY REPORTS (4
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Google has launched an AI reasoning model, Gemini 2.5 Pro. The model
leads in coding and math capabilities, but Google hasn't released
safety reports yet. Google plans to publish these reports after
collecting feedback from experimental releases, though this approach
raises transparency concerns. Despite pledges for transparency, Google
seems to prioritize speed in model deployments, diverging from
industry norms for responsible AI practices.

 CODE WITH CLAUDE DEVELOPER CONFERENCE (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Anthropic has announced its first developer event focused on hands-on
sessions and best practices for building with Claude - it is set to
take place in May in San Francisco. 

 THE LLM COURSE FROM HUGGING FACE (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Hugging Face has revamped its popular NLP course into a broader LLM
curriculum with expanded chapters on fine-tuning, reasoning models,
and modern AI agent workflows. 

 DEVIN, THE VIRAL CODING AI AGENT, GETS A NEW PAY-AS-YOU-GO PLAN (2
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Cognition launched a $20 entry-level plan for its AI programming
tool, Devin, which has been improved to handle complex coding tasks
better.
