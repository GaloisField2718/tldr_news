HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

TRAIN A CHATGPT COMPETITOR FOR $85K AND RUN IT IN YOUR BROWSER (8
MINUTE READ)
[https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/17/beat-chatgpt-in-a-browser/?utm_source=tldrai]


Based on the calculations from the Llama paper, you could likely train
your own 7 Billion parameter language model on purely public datasets
for 82,000 GPU hours on A100 GPUs. Then by using self-instruct to
further tune the model, you could have an open language model that is
competitive with state of the art models. 

ZAPIER LAUNCHES NATURAL LANGUAGE ACTIONS (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions?utm_source=tldrai] 

Zapier launched a general purpose, AI-powered API called Natural
Language Actions (NLA) to integrate Zapier actions into any app. NLA
is optimized for natural language based products, like chatbots or
products built with LLMs, but can be used by any developer. Put
Zapier's 5K+ apps and 20K+ actions inside your product and use simple
natural language to move info between apps. 

MIDJOURNEY V5 IS HERE! (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/midjourney-v5-language-model-adds-realism-to-human-hands/?utm_source=tldrai]


Midjourney announced version 5 of its commercial AI image-synthesis
service, which can produce photorealistic images at a quality level
that some AI art fans are calling creepy and "too perfect." Midjourney
v5 offers a wider stylistic range, more prompt sensitivity, less
unwanted text, and a 2x enhancement in image resolution. Midjourney v5
is available now as an alpha test for customers who subscribe to the
Midjourney service, which is available through Discord.

COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT ENGINEERING (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/?utm_source=tldrai]


Prompt engineering is the process of steering language models to
perform tasks. There are a number of different ways to do it from zero
shot to few shot and chain of thought. This blog post contains
extremely comprehensive citations and interesting ideas for future
work. 

RESIDUAL CONNECTION IN TRANSFORMERS HAS A PRIVILEGED BASIS (18 MINUTE
READ)
[https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/privileged-basis/index.html?utm_source=tldrai]


The skip connection in the Transformer architecture improves stability
and trainability. Our theoretical understanding suggests that none of
the dimensions in the residual connection should contain more
information than others. In practice, however, this turns out to not
be true with some dimensions having dramatically larger activation
values. This post explores potential causes, and comes to the
conclusion that the per-parameter memory in Adam might lead to this
issue. 

COLT5: LONG-INPUT TRANSFORMER MODEL WITH CONDITIONAL COMPUTATION (12
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09752?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article presents COLT5, a new long-input Transformer model that
uses conditional computation to allocate more resources to important
tokens, achieving state-of-the-art results on the long-input SCROLLS
benchmark with faster training and inference, and effective processing
of extremely long inputs.

ALPACA LORA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora?utm_source=tldrai] 

Low Rank Adaptation is a method to fine-tune language models by
updating only a small subset of the parameters. This repo contains
code that assists in tuning the popular Llama models via instruction
tuning on consumer hardware due to the reduced computational
requirements of Lora. 

ML COMMANDS (3 MINUTE READ)

A list of extremely useful commands for ML research from a HuggingFace
research scientist. It includes things like distributed training,
environment set up, and configuration tasks. A useful reference for
any practitioner. 

GLUEGEN: EFFICIENTLY UPGRADING TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS WITH GLUENET (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10056?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article proposes GlueGen, a method that aligns features from
different encoders with the latent space of an existing text-to-image
(T2I) model using the GlueNet model and a new training objective. This
allows for efficient integration of new functionality, such as
multilingual language models and multi-modal encoders, into existing
T2I models, enabling sound-to-image generation and upgrading the
current text encoder for challenging case generation.

KHAN ACADEMY AND OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/customer-stories/khan-academy?utm_source=tldrai] 

Khan Academy is a nonprofit that offers thousands of lessons in math,
science and the humanities for students of all ages. Khan Academy
announced that it will use GPT-4 to power Khanmigo, an AI-powered
assistant that functions as both a virtual tutor for students and a
classroom assistant for teachers. The nonprofit began testing the
newest version of OpenAI‚Äôs language model in 2022 and will initially
make the Khanmigo pilot program available to a limited number of
participants, though the public is invited to join the waitlist.

GM WANTS TO BRING CHATGPT-LIKE ASSISTANT TO DRIVERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.semafor.com/article/03/10/2023/gm-wants-to-bring-chatgpt-like-assistant-to-drivers?utm_source=tldrai]


A voice-activated interface for drivers has long been a goal of car
companies and tech companies alike, but the idea has never reached its
potential. General Motors has a head start on incorporating the new
ChatGPT technology in its vehicles because of its two-year-old
partnership with Microsoft on autonomous vehicles.
