ELON WANTS TO CHALLENGE GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/7xMgQ?utm_source=tldrai] 

Elon Musk said he sees the need for an artificial-intelligence
business to rival Google and Microsoft that could involve different
parts of his corporate empire, including Twitter. 

META RELEASES MEGABYTE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.artisana.ai/articles/meta-ai-unleashes-megabyte-a-revolutionary-scalable-model-architecture?utm_source=tldrai]


Meta AI has proposed a new AI model architecture called Megabyte which
can generate more than 1 million tokens across multiple formats.
Megabyte addresses scalability issues in current models and performs
calculations in parallel, boosting efficiency and outperforming
Transformers. 

SNOWFLAKE ACQUIRES NEEVA TO BRING INTELLIGENT SEARCH TO ITS CLOUD DATA
MANAGEMENT SOLUTION (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/snowflake-acquires-neeva-to-bring-intelligent-search-to-its-cloud-data-management-solution/?utm_source=tldrai]


Cloud data management company, Snowflake, has acquired Neeva, a
startup focused on AI-powered search. The terms of the deal have not
been disclosed. Founded by ex-Google employees, Neeva had originally
worked on both consumer and enterprise search tools, but recently
pivoted exclusively towards enterprise solutions. With Neeva's
generative AI search expertise, Snowflake plans to enhance its data
discovery capabilities, making search more intelligent and interactive
at scale.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

QLORA 65B PARAMETER MODELS FINE-TUNED ON 48GB GPU (32 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314?utm_source=tldrai] 

LoRA is a way to fine-tune models much more cheaply than full
fine-tuning. It works by just updating a small, carefully selected,
subset of the model. However, even then it is often too expensive to
fine-tune large (more than 13B parameter) models on commodity
hardware. Quantization reduces the precision of parameters in the
model which in turn takes less space. More great open source progress.


SEAHORSE: A TOOL FOR EVALUATING MULTILINGUAL SUMMARIZATION SYSTEMS (9
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13194?utm_source=tldrai] 

SEAHORSE is a dataset created to assess the quality of summarization
systems in multiple languages. It contains 96,000 summaries that have
been rated by humans based on six important aspects: clarity,
repetition, grammar, attribution, main ideas, and conciseness. This
dataset not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance
of automated metrics but also provides a valuable resource for
training such metrics, helping researchers advance the field of
multilingual summarization evaluation. 

META-IN-CONTEXT LEARNING: RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT OF LARGE LANGUAGE
MODELS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12907?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces meta-in-context learning, a recursive
self-improvement process for large language models. By studying
regression and decision-making tasks, the researchers demonstrate that
meta-in-context learning enhances the models' in-context learning
abilities, modifies their strategies, and achieves competitive
performance on real-world problems. This work sheds light on improving
language models without relying solely on traditional fine-tuning
approaches.

CONTROLVIDEO: TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION WITH IMPROVED CONSISTENCY AND
QUALITY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/YBYBZhang/ControlVideo?utm_source=tldrai] 

ControlVideo is a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
generating videos from text by introducing a training-free approach.
By leveraging structural consistency, enhancing appearance coherence,
mitigating flicker effects, and employing hierarchical sampling,
ControlVideo outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality
videos that are both short and long. Importantly, ControlVideo
achieves these results efficiently, generating videos within minutes
using a single NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.

AMAZON‚ÄôS AI SEEN AS INCOMPLETE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/NGRr9?utm_source=tldrai] 

Amazon‚Äôs cloud customers are clamoring to get their hands on the
ChatGPT-style technology the company unveiled six weeks ago. But
instead of being allowed to test it, many are being told to sit tight,
prompting concerns the artificial intelligence tool isn‚Äôt fully
baked. 

NEURAL NETWORKS LEARN LANGUAGES SIMILARLY TO HUMANS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.quantamagazine.org/some-neural-networks-learn-language-like-humans-20230522/?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses a study that compared the brain waves of humans
listening to a simple sound to the signal produced by a neural network
analyzing the same sound. The results were uncannily alike, suggesting
that natural and artificial networks learn in similar ways, at least
when it comes to language 

THE DIRE DEFECT OF AI CONTENT MODERATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/SW7Zn?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article discusses the challenges of using artificial intelligence
to moderate content across multiple languages. It argues that current
AI systems are not able to accurately detect harmful content in all
languages, and that this can have serious consequences. It finishes by
calling for more research into how to improve the accuracy of AI
content moderation systems, and for more transparency from social
media companies about how they are using AI to moderate content.
