 AI MODE IN SEARCH GETS NEW AGENTIC FEATURES AND EXPANDS GLOBALLY (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's AI Mode is expanding from three countries to over 180
territories. The company is also rolling out new agentic capabilities
that let Gemini browse the web and handle multi-step tasks like making
a restaurant reservation. 

 ANTHROPIC SEEKS TO RAISE $10 BILLION AMID STRONG INVESTOR INTEREST (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic is reportedly in advanced talks to raise as much as $10
billion in a new funding round. The discussions are still ongoing, and
terms could change. Anthropic raised $3.5 billion in March, giving it
a post-money valuation of $61.5 billion. It recently expanded the
prompt window for Claude Sonnet 4 fivefold and announced that it would
offer Claude to all three branches of the US government for $1 per
agency for one year. 

 GOOGLE SCORES SIX-YEAR META CLOUD DEAL WORTH OVER $10 BILLION (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has agreed to spend more than $10 billion on Google Cloud
services in an agreement that spans six years. While the companies are
rivals in online ads, Meta needs all the cloud infrastructure it can
access. It has also made commitments to use cloud services from Amazon
and Microsoft.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BUILDING AI PRODUCTS IN THE PROBABILISTIC ERA (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People have always been skeptical of new technologies, but the world
eventually catches up and reaches a new equilibrium. AI is shuffling
the deck again, making many past playbooks obsolete. For the first
time in the digital era, marginal costs are way larger than zero. This
means the way we produce products needs to be radically different.
Organizations that build using an empirical approach, think in
probabilities, and measure complex trajectories will define the next
era of technology. 

 QUESTIONING MARGINS IS A BORING CLICHE… (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Lower gross margins at a moment in time are not a long-term indicator
of a lack of a sustainable business model. AI applications deliver
deep customer value, strong usage and retention, and explosive net
expansion. Margins alone don't tell the full story. Fixating on
margins while ignoring a company's value to its customers, retention,
and ease of acquisition misses the mark. There are many effective
strategies for AI app companies to drive healthy margins in the long
term. 

 DO YOU HAVE TOO MANY AI PRODUCTS? (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People who buy AI tools should avoid purchasing redundant tools and
focus on actual impact. They should have clear goals and know what
business problems they're solving with AI and the impact that's going
to have. Builders should be careful about how they position their
products and be clear about their value propositions. The boring stuff
matters, as that's what allows enterprises to confidently use products
in their workflows.

 “WE SAFELY ACCELERATED AI ADOPTION WHILE REDUCING AI GOVERNANCE
FRICTION BY 60%” (SPONSOR) [12] 

 That's what a Fortune 100 leader shared after embedding Credo AI
governance experts. They cut manual governance efforts by 60% [13] and
increased cross-functional engagement by 3x. Credo AI Advisory
Services deliver measurable, compliant and standardized AI
governance—so you can scale AI with confidence and trust. Talk to an
expert today [13]! 

 TWO BIG UPDATES TO THE RESPONSES API TODAY (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI has introduced Connectors and Conversations to its Responses
API. Connectors pull context from other apps using a single API call.
Conversations allow persistent chat threads for users without
developers having to run their own database. The new features are
compatible with Deep Research. 

 PACT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 PACT (Pairwise Auction Conversation Testbed) is a benchmark for
conversational bargaining by language models. It allows researchers to
study haggling skills in language models. The benchmark contains over
5,000 games of 20 rounds each. Results from the current top models are
available in the repository. 

 PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION VIA DUAL LEARNING (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DuPO introduces a dual learning framework that avoids manual
annotations by generating self-supervised feedback through a
generalized duality approach.

 AMAZON IS BETTING ON AGENTS TO WIN THE AI RACE (47 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 One of the biggest topics in AI these days is that AI is going to
move from chatbots to reliably completing real-world tasks. However,
agents really aren't all that reliable right now. There's a lot of
work happening in the AI industry to try to fix that. In this
interview, David Luan, the head of Amazon's AGI research lab, talks
about why progress on AI models has slowed and predictions for what's
next in the industry. 

 GM RAIDED SILICON VALLEY TO BUILD ITS NEW AI TEAM. HERE'S WHAT IT'S
DOING (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 General Motors (GM) has made nearly a dozen hires from top tech
companies in the last eight months. It is aiming to build a small but
elite AI center of excellence. The team is already helping GM
executives from manufacturing to engineering use AI more effectively.
It will consult on AI uses, help individual groups build their own AI
workforces, secure partnerships, and negotiate vendor contracts.

 GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT? THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF CURATED LEXICAL
DATASETS (SPONSOR) [19] 

 Internet-scraped data can get you very far, but it has its limit. The
next generation of LLM and NLP models requires high-quality, human
curated lexical data. Download the Oxford Languages whitepaper [19] 

 NOTEBOOKLM TO PULL SOURCES FROM WEB AND GOOGLE DRIVE VIA DEEP
RESEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google has begun integrating Deep Research capabilities into
NotebookLM, allowing users to streamline the process of finding
sources and bringing relevant research content directly into their
notebooks. 

 HONEY, I SHRUNK THE IMAGE AND NOW I'M PWNED (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Google Gemini CLI and other production AI systems can be deceived by
image scaling attacks, which involve embedding prompts that tell AI to
act against their guidelines within images, hidden from human eyes. 

 GOOGLE RELEASES FIRST PRODUCTION AI ENERGY DATA (15 MINUTE READ) [22]


 The median Gemini prompt consumes 0.24 watt-hours, equivalent to
running a microwave for one second or watching TV for nine seconds.
