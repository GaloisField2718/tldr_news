HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AI ALLIANCE LAUNCHES AS AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR SAFE AND OPEN
AI (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The AI Alliance, led by IBM and Meta, unites over 50 global
organizations to foster open, responsible AI development. It focuses
on setting AI standards, advancing hardware, and promoting AI
education and skills. Members include major tech firms, universities,
and research institutions. The Alliance emphasizes safety, diversity,
and equitable access to AI innovation. 

 ELON‚ÄôS AI FIRM XAI FILES TO RAISE UP TO $1B (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI has filed with the
U.S. securities regulator to raise up to $1 billion in an equity
offering. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS NEW AI EXPERIMENT COMPOSES ABSTRACT MUSICAL CLIPS INSPIRED
BY INSTRUMENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's Instrument Playground allows users to create unique music
pieces inspired by over 100 global instruments using MusicLM. Users
can input an instrument name with an adjective for style and the AI
generates a 20-second audio clip, which can be further customized with
options like "Ambient," "Beat," and "Pitch" in a sequencer, allowing
the creation and download of personalized musical compositions.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LANGUAGE MODEL SELF-TEACHING FOR DOMAIN ADAPTATION (14 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 When trying to use language models in domains that require niche
knowledge, you can either fine-tune or use some retrieval techniques.
Both have drawbacks. This novel method uses self-generated synthetic
data to better learn the information at test time. It shows marked
improvements in standard adaptation benchmarks over both fine-tuning
and RAG. 

 DEEP DIVE: RECENT ADVANCES IN INSTRUCTION TUNING (12 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Language models vastly improved in usefulness after instruction
tuning was introduced. There have been many recent advances like
synthetic data pipelines that make the process better and more
efficient. 

 TRACKING WITH 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gaussian Splatting is an amazing method for 3D reconstruction. In
this case, the scientists are working to remove COLMAP from their
visual mapping and tracking systems. The results are compelling,
though there is still some heavy computation that needs to happen.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DIFFUSION VISION TRANSFORMERS FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE GENERATION
(GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This project explores the effectiveness of vision transformers in
diffusion-based generative learning, unveiling the Diffusion Vision
Transformers (DiffiT). This model combines a U-shaped encoder-decoder
architecture with a novel time-dependent self-attention module. 

 3D-CONSISTENT IMAGES FROM A SINGLE VIEW WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB
REPO) [12] 

 This project presents Zero123++, a model that generates consistent
multi-view images from just one input image using diffusion
principles. By utilizing pretrained 2D models, Zero123++ addresses
challenges like texture quality and alignment issues. 

 ADVANCING SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION IN RGB-D VIDEOS (GITHUB REPO) [13]


 This repo unveils two major contributions: the RDVS dataset, rich in
diverse RGB-D video scenes, and DCTNet+, a specialized network for
RGB-D video object detection, equipped with innovative features for
precise prediction and improved performance over existing models. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 STYLE ALIGNED TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Really stunning work by Google built on SDXL that shares attention
for generations to maintain consistent styles. This method crucially
doesn't require any fine-tuning. 

 RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION LABS LAUNCHES FIRST PRO-INNOVATION RESPONSIBLE
AI PROTOCOL FOR STARTUPS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nonprofit Responsible Innovation Labs (RIL) has launched a voluntary
industry-driven protocol for responsible AI, particularly for startups
and their investors. The protocol, supported by 35 leading venture
capital funds, is designed to ensure startups integrate responsible AI
practices as they scale. This move aligns with the Biden
Administration's vision for responsible AI. 

 TWO TITANS ON THE FUTURE OF AI (WITH REID HOFFMAN AND VINOD KHOSLA)
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A good recap of the 45+ minute talks between Reid Hoffman and Vinod
Khosla with each diving into a variety of topics from AI to
‚Äútechno-optimist‚Äù manifestos. Both titans have great perspectives
on things to come and how the tech industry should be regulated.

 NEW REPORT ILLUMINATES WHY OPENAI BOARD SAID ALTMAN ‚ÄúWAS NOT
CONSISTENTLY CANDID‚Äù (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Sam Altman's brief ousting as OpenAI CEO was linked to accusations of
manipulating board members to dismiss Helen Toner, who had critiqued
OpenAI's AI safety approach, a situation variously viewed as
manipulative or a clumsy attempt at control. 

 SOLVE INTELLIGENCE HELPS ATTORNEYS DRAFT PATENTS FOR IP ANALYSIS AND
GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Solve Intelligence is an AI-native platform that helps draft
high-quality patents efficiently. Since their launch in July, more
than 25+ IP firms globally are now using them, with customers
reporting 60-90% efficiency improvements. The company graduated from Y
Combinator and recently announced their $3M seed round. 

 AIRBNB ACQUIRE GAMEPLANNER.AI (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Airbnb has acquired AI company GamePlanner.AI, a company led by Siri
co-founder Adam Cheyer and AI expert Siamak Hodjat. The team will
focus on accelerating selected AI projects and integrating their tools
with Airbnb's platform. Airbnb and GamePlanner.AI share a commitment
to using AI to enhance human connection.
