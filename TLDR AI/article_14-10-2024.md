 SILICON VALLEY IS DEBATING IF AI WEAPONS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE
TO KILL (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Debate over fully autonomous weapons continues as Anduril's Palmer
Luckey expresses openness to them, contrasting with Shield AI's
previous stance against AI making lethal decisions. The U.S.
government remains non-committal, with no binding ban on such weapons,
amidst fears that adversaries like China or Russia might develop them
first. Defense tech companies, including Anduril and Palantir, are
lobbying heavily to influence policy on the integration of AI in
military systems.

invention ideas. 

 BURN THE PLAYBOOKS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI excels at following defined rulesets, making it particularly
effective for tasks like automating tax processes. Playbook-driven
success limits human creativity, which AI can already surpass in
formulaic tasks such as math tests and coding. By relying heavily on
playbooks, we risk diminishing our unique human creativity and
becoming more machine-like, reinforcing AI's strengths over ours.
