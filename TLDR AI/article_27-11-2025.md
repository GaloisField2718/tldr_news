HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PERPLEXITY ADDS MEMORY TO ITS AI ASSISTANTS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Perplexity introduced personalization features that allow its AI
assistant to retain preferences, interests, and context across
conversations. This memory system improves answer quality and reduces
context engineering by automatically loading relevant information for
continuity. 

 ANTHROPIC CEO CALLED TO TESTIFY ON CHINESE AI CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Anthropic CEO Dario Amondei has been asked to testify at a hearing on
December 17 on how Chinese state actors used Claude Code in a
wide-reaching cyber-espionage campaign. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian
and Quantum Xchange CEO Eddy Zervigon were also asked to testify at a
hearing on the future of AI and cybersecurity next month. Lawmakers
are increasingly interested in hearing more about how nation-state
hackers could use AI tools to conduct attacks and how AI can be used
to defend organizations. 

 ROBINHOOD CEO'S MATH-FOCUSED AI STARTUP HARMONIC VALUED AT $1.45
BILLION IN LATEST FUNDRAISING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Harmonic, co-founded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, has raised $120
million, valuing the AI startup at $1.45 billion. The company focuses
on AI's math and reasoning, aiming to eliminate "hallucinations" and
is exploring commercial applications in safety-critical industries.
Investors include Ribbit Capital, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, and
Emerson Collective.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE "ERA OF EXPERIENCE" (55 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post discusses a shift from models that learn by predicting the
next work to models that gain experience via interaction with
environments. There will soon be a shift towards AI models being
increasingly trained via interaction with environments via
reinforcement learning. The post details the technical process
underpinning that shift. There will be significant opportunities for
new businesses to be built around recent developments in reinforcement
learning in the next year. 

 CONTINUOUS BATCHING (39 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post explains how continuous batching works. Continuous batching
maximizes throughput by processing multiple conversations in parallel.
Optimizing attention and KV caching enables faster and more scalable
LLM serving under heavy user load.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 EVERMIND: NEAR-INFINITE CONTEXT FOR EVERY AI AGENT AND APPLICATION
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 EverMind is the long-term memory OS for next-generation AI
applications. With EverMind, agents can continuously improve with
every interaction: remembering, learning, and adapting over time.
Memory is persistent, consistent, and retrievable - unlocking AI
that's more coherent, personalized, and capable. Check out the open
source repo on GitHub [10] or join the waitlist [9]. 

 EFFECTIVE HARNESSES FOR LONG-RUNNING AGENTS (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Developers are increasingly requiring agents to take on complex tasks
that require work that spans hours or even days. Getting agents to
make consistent progress across multiple context windows remains an
open problem. Agents need a way to bridge the gap between coding
sessions as context windows are limited, and most complex projects
can't be completed within a single window. This article proposes a
two-fold solution, with an initializer agent setting up the
environment on the first run, and a coding agent tasked with making
incremental progress in every session while leaving artifacts for the
next session. Code examples are provided. 

 GEMINI CLI TIPS & TRICKS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Gemini CLI is an AI assistant that brings Google Gemini directly into
the terminal. It functions as a conversational agentic command-line
tool. Gemini CLI can reason about requests, choose tools, and execute
multi-step plans. It acts like a supercharged pair programmer and
command-line assistant. The assistant excels at coding tasks,
debugging, content generation, and system automation. 

 WORKMUX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 workmux is an opinionated workflow tool for managing git worktrees
and tmux windows as isolated development environments. It is perfect
for running multiple AI agents in parallel without conflict. workmux
makes managing parallel development tasks or multiple AI agents as
simple as managing tmux windows.

 WHY AI SAFETY WON'T MAKE AMERICA LOSE THE RACE WITH CHINA (34 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The US holds a 10x compute advantage over China. Proposed safety
regulations might add 1-2% to training costs through disclosure
requirements and capability evaluations, which won't meaningfully
erode the lead. What could catastrophically undermine it: chip export
lobbying that would collapse the advantage to 2x or application-layer
regulations that strangle deployment with compliance burdens. 

 A MOMENT THAT FUNDAMENTALLY EXTENDS AI'S CAPABILITIES AND RESHAPE THE
ENTIRE ECONOMY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 If xAI's model can successfully compete in League of Legends, that
means that it would be able to read and understand any computer
interface without needing a specialized API. The model will also need
to be able to reason and produce a robust and complex plan. Such a
model would be a game-changer for AI capabilities and the global
economy.

 CHINA'S TECH GIANTS MOVE AI MODEL TRAINING OVERSEAS TO ACCESS NVIDIA
CHIPS (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chinese companies are training their AI models through lease
agreements with foreign data centers owned and operated by non-Chinese
entities. 

 FIRST MAKE IT FAST, THEN MAKE IT SMART (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Faster models might not be as 'smart', but they're capable of many
tasks and can iterate quickly if they make mistakes. 

 ANDREW NG RELEASES AI “AGENTIC REVIEWER” FOR RESEARCH PAPERS (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Andrew Ng introduced an agentic paper-review system trained on ICLR
2025 reviews, showing AI-human review correlation slightly higher than
human-human.
