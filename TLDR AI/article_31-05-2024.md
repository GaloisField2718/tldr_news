 YOUR GO-TO ELECTROLYTE DRINK FOR CRAMPS, HEADACHES, AND FATIGUE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 It's not dehydration that's holding you back. It's overhydration.

When you drink too much water, you dilute your blood sodium levels.
This causes headaches, muscle cramps, worse sleep, and hurts your
overall performance ‚Äî whether at the gym or WFH.

Here's your alternative üëá

	* LMNT [5] is a science-backed electrolyte drink mix [5] designed to
support active hydration and a healthy lifestyle.
 	* Zero sugar. No artificial colors. No dodgy ingredients.
 	* Created by a former research biochemist and used by the world's
top performers [5].

Get your free Sample Pack with any drink mix purchase at
drinkLMNT.com/TLDR [5]. And try the new LMNT Sparkling ‚Äî a bold,
16-ounce can of sparkling electrolyte water.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 YUAN 2.0-M32: MIXTURE OF EXPERTS WITH ATTENTION ROUTER (15 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Yuan 2.0-M32 is a Mixture of Experts model with 40B parameters, 3.7B
active at any time. It performs close to Llama 3 70B despite using
1/19th the compute. It was trained on 2T tokens and seems surprisingly
powerful for its size. 

 SCALING LAWS AND COMPUTE-OPTIMAL TRAINING BEYOND FIXED TRAINING
DURATIONS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The original scaling laws papers used a Cosine learning rate schedule
which doesn't achieve optimal loss if the Cosine period isn't aligned
with the total training steps. This makes it challenging to train
enough models to create meaningful scaling laws. This paper introduces
the idea of a constant learning rate with a cool down as a way to
reduce GPU costs for scaling law creation. 

 ULTRA-HD IMAGE DERAINING (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers have introduced a new dataset called 4K-Rain13k that
features 13,000 pairs of 4K resolution images to tackle the challenge
of deraining ultra-high-definition (UHD) images.

substantially more post training images than other ControlNets and
boasts powerful performance. 

 VIDEO GENERATION WITH TRANSFORMERS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 EasyAnimate is a method that adapts the DiT framework for advanced 3D
video generation using transformers. This project incorporates a
motion module block to capture temporal dynamics, ensuring smooth
motion transitions and consistent frames. 

 BOOSTING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH SELF-EXPLORING OPTIMIZATION (GITHUB
REPO) [16]

 TEXT2VIDEO TURBO (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Consistency Distillation applied to video models dramatically reduces
the number of steps needed to generate content. 

 AI WON'T EAT YOUR JOB, BUT IT WILL EAT YOUR SALARY (10 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 AI threatens not just the existence of jobs but the skill premium
associated with tasks, potentially reducing the wages for skilled
labor. AI could re-bundle job tasks and lower the barriers to task
performance, leading to commoditization and decreased ability to
charge a premium salary. As AI evolves, especially through AI agents,
managerial advantages may also diminish, challenging the
human-in-the-loop advantage and further eroding skill premiums.
