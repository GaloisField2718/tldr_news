HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 RETOOL STATE OF AI REPORT (35 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Retool's State of AI report, which surveyed 1,500 tech workers,
reveals generative AI's growing impact on business. MongoDB Atlas
Vector Search leads in popularity among vector databases, vital for
AI-powered apps enhancing productivity and customer experiences.
However, challenges in AI adoption persist, notably in model accuracy
and data security, with C-suite executives showing greater optimism
than individual contributors. 

 YOU.COM LAUNCHES NEW APIS TO CONNECT LLMS TO THE WEB (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 You.com has launched APIs starting at $100 per month, enabling large
language models like Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 to access up-to-date internet
data and offering enhanced answer accuracy through web search and news
functionalities. 

 MICROSOFT AND OPENAI PARTNERSHIP UNVEILS NEW AI OPPORTUNITIES (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 At OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay, Microsoft announced plans to offer the new
GPT-4 Turbo on Azure OpenAI Service by year-end, providing enhanced
control and efficiencies at lower costs. OpenAI's Custom Models
program will seamlessly integrate with Microsoft's ecosystem, boosting
enterprises‚Äô AI capabilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 POWERFUL NOUS FINE-TUNE OF THE 34B YI MODEL (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [9] 

 Nous research has released a very strong 34B model built on top of
the bilingual Yi model. Capybara is trained primarily on multi-turn
data with more than 1000 tokens per conversation, which makes it
uniquely positioned for certain user-facing tasks with high
information density. 

 LLM DECONTAMINAOR (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When new models come out with astounding capabilities, it is natural
to question whether they actually trained on the validation data or on
benchmarks. Decontamination is the process of removing such testing
data from the input. The LMSYS group found that if you rephrase test
data in a way that passes decontamination but still contains
information about the benchmark, you can fake your way to amazing
performance. 

 MONODIFFUSION: DEPTH ESTIMATION WITHOUT GROUND-TRUTH (16 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This study introduces MonoDiffusion, a novel framework for
self-supervised monocular depth estimation, which uniquely approaches
the challenge as an iterative denoising process. It utilizes a pseudo
ground-truth diffusion process guided by a pre-trained teacher model
to improve depth map accuracy without using actual depth ground-truth
in training.

 IBM DEBUTS $500 MILLION ENTERPRISE AI VENTURE FUND (3 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 IBM has committed $500 million to invest in generative AI startups
that cater to business clients, signaling a strategic shift and
indicating its readiness to support emerging companies, with a
preference for those that complement rather than compete with its own

personal assistant tools on T-Mobile's network. 

 LANGUAGE MODELS CAN USE STEGANOGRAPHY TO HIDE THEIR REASONING (5
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A study by Redwood Research reveals that large language models (LLMs)
can master "encoded reasoning," a form of steganography allowing LLMs
to embed intermediate reasoning steps in generated text, making them
undecipherable to humans.
