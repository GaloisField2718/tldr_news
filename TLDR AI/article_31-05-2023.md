HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

SOUTH KOREA‚ÄôS NAVER TO TARGET FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WITH LATEST
CHATGPT-LIKE AI MODEL (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/NTxfJ?utm_source=tldrai] 

South Korean internet giant Naver plans to provide foreign governments
with tailored versions of its latest ChatGPT-like AI model, focusing
on localization to address political and cultural needs. The company
is also set to launch HyperClova X, an upgrade to enhance its domestic
services.

A statement from leading AI researchers imploring society to treat the
risk of extinction from AI similarly to pandemic and nuclear war. 

CHATGPT ‚ÄòHALLUCINATES.‚Äô SOME RESEARCHERS WORRY IT ISN‚ÄôT FIXABLE.
(9 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/30/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-bard-trustworthy/?utm_source=tldrai]


MIT researchers have proposed a novel "society of minds" approach to
address AI "hallucinations", where large language models like OpenAI's
GPT-4 generate false or inaccurate information. The method involves
using multiple chatbots to provide different responses to the same
question, with the bots debating until they reach a consensus. Despite
the creativity of such solutions, it's clear that hallucinations
remain a significant challenge in AI technology. Hallucinations impact
the reliability of AI-generated content and raise concerns about
potential misuse in sensitive fields like medicine, law, and
cybersecurity.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

GENERATE IMAGES WITH A LANGUAGE MODEL (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://jykoh.com/gill?utm_source=tldrai] 

Multimodal training of more than one data type has been gaining
popularity recently. Usually,¬†the model architecture requires
complicated and somewhat brittle solutions. Gill is a cool new project
that interleaves text tokens with image tokens to allow for truly
multimodal input and output. The reported results are compelling
although there are still limitations. 

CONTROLVIDEO: EXTENDING CONTROLNET TO VIDEOS (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17098?utm_source=tldrai] 

ControlVideo is a new way to edit videos based on written
instructions, making the video more faithful and consistent with the
text while maintaining the original video's structure. It achieves
this by combining advanced techniques. ControlVideo improves upon
previous methods in terms of accuracy and realism. It offers a lot of
flexibility in how much of the original video information to use. 

BOOSTING LANGUAGE MODEL PERFORMANCE WITH SELF-NOTE TAKING METHOD (6
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00833?utm_source=tldrai] 

Large language models sometimes have trouble remembering things and
thinking through multiple steps. A new method lets these models take
notes on their own, helping them remember better and solve more
complex problems.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ARE NOT FAIR EVALUATORS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/i-Eval/FairEval?utm_source=tldrai] 

It is challenging to compare the performance of multiple models to one
another. Traditional automated measures aren't robust and human
evaluation isn't scalable. Recently people have been turning to GPT4
as a proxy for human preference. After all, it was trained with RLHF.
However, doing this naively results in miscalibration. This work
proposes a few simple fixes that aligns GPT4 evaluations more closely
with those of humans. 

GORILLA: ENHANCING THE POWER OF LLMS IN GENERATING API CALLS (3 MINUTE
READ) [https://shishirpatil.github.io/gorilla/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Gorilla, a refined model based on Large Language Models (LLMs),
significantly outperforms existing models like GPT-4 in writing API
calls. It helps language models use tools more effectively. Combined
with a document retriever, Gorilla adjusts well to updated documents,
minimizes inaccurate creations, and maintains the reliability of
outputs, as demonstrated using a new comprehensive dataset called
APIBench. 

ENHANCING TEXT-TO-3D GENERATION WITH PROLIFICDREAMER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/thu-ml/prolificdreamer?utm_source=tldrai] 

ProlificDreamer is a new method for improving text-to-3D generation.
It solves problems like over-saturation and low-diversity found in the
earlier Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) approach by treating the 3D
parameter as a random variable. This Variational Score Distillation
(VSD) framework can produce higher quality and more diverse results,
allowing the creation of highly detailed and photo-realistic 3D images
from text, including complex effects such as smoke and drops.
