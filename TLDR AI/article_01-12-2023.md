 MARTIAN'S TOOL AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES BETWEEN LLMS TO REDUCE COSTS (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI researchers Shriyash Upadhyay and Etan Ginsberg have launched a
startup, Martian, supported by $9 million in funding. Martian created
a "model router" tool that optimizes the use of large language AI
models such as GPT-4 by smartly routing requests to the most suitable
model for the task, making it more cost-efficient. The founders
believe this approach promotes fundamental rather than competitive
research.
