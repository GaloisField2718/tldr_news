 IS COMPLIANCE THE WEAKEST LINK OF YOUR AI STRATEGY? (SPONSOR) [3] 

 When it comes to AI, you have to move fast. But before you launch,
you're going to need NIST AI RMF [3]‚Ä¶ and maybe also SOC 2, ISO
27001, HIPAA, GDPR‚Ä¶ üòñ
So how can you safely implement AI systems without being a business
blocker?

‚è© Better yet, how can you automate your compliance around AI?

Drata [3] is SaaS that walks you step-by-step through the compliance
journey. It automates pretty much all of the manual processes. You can
put security and compliance on autopilot [3] and get back to building.

 DOES AI NEED A "BODY" TO BECOME TRULY INTELLIGENT? META RESEARCHERS
THINK SO (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta AI research's embodiment hypothesis suggests that true
intelligence requires a physical form for sensory and environmental
interaction. AI Habitat 3.0, Meta's updated simulation platform, aims
to bridge the sim-to-real gap by training AIs with virtual bodies in
simulated environments. It now has human avatars. Real-world testing
is underway, with companies like Agility Robotics and Apptronik
deploying robots alongside humans in various research and industrial
settings.
