 VENICE: PRIVATE AND UNCENSORED AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Before AI even had a chance to take off, it was taken over by groups
that wished to control it - with policies, permissions,
privacy-violating user tracking, and censored responses.

Venice [4] is different.

Just like ChatGPT or Claude, Venice lets you search for information,
have conversations, analyze documents, and create images and art.

However:

‚úÖ Venice doesn't spy on you

‚úÖ Venice doesn't censor AI responses

‚úÖ Venice lets you choose which open source model you want to use,
and edit the System Prompt.
