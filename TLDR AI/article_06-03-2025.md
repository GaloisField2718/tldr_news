HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI INTRODUCES NEXT GEN AI (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has unveiled Next Gen AI, a suite of advanced tools designed
to boost developers' efficiency in building AI applications. The new
offering features enhanced model performance and streamlined
integration options, facilitating a wide range of use cases. This
initiative aims to empower developers to innovate faster and more
effectively in the evolving AI landscape. 

 SUTTON AND BARTO WIN THE TURING AWARD (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The two have done years of groundbreaking research and education in
Reinforcement Learning. 

 QWQ 32B REASONING MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Qwen team has trained an open weight, Apache 2.0, licensed model
that performs on par with DeepSeek R1 and better than many of the
larger distill models. They found that by building on outcome based
rewards with formal verification and test-case checks, the model can
continuously improve at math and code. Also, by mixing in general
instruction following data later in RL training, the model can still
align with human preference.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMPROVING SCALABILITY OF PIPELINE PARALLELISM WITH MEMORY
OPTIMIZATION (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Pipeline Parallelism is a great strategy when sharding models across
many GPUs. However, it uses substantial memory. This paper, which
comes with code, uses offloading to effectively reduce the memory
required when the number of shards increases making PP a strong
alternative to TP for large model training. 

 LAYOUT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ToLo introduces a two-stage, training-free layout-to-image framework
designed for high-overlap layouts. 

 INFRARED IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DifIISR enhances infrared image super-resolution using diffusion
models, integrating perceptual priors and thermal spectrum regulation
to improve both visual fidelity and machine perception.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HOW AI2 IS PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF OPEN SOURCE AI WITH NVIDIA
HOPPER GPUS AND CIRRASCALE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Ai2 is a nonprofit research institute dedicated to developing fully
open source AI solutions. They needed to deploy a cluster of 1,024
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs efficiently while building out their data center.
Cirrascale [10] delivered customized, scalable infrastructure designed
to reduce TCO and enable innovation. Read the case study [10] 

 SPARK TEXT TO SPEECH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Strong voice cloning text-to-speech model built on Qwen. It supports
emotive prompting along with the text input. Interestingly, the
researchers found 8k tokens in the Codec to be sufficient for powerful
speech generation. 

 HIGH-QUALITY AUDIO COMPRESSION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 FlowDec is a full-band audio codec leveraging conditional flow
matching and non-adversarial training for high-fidelity 48 kHz audio
compression. 

 SIMPLIFYING 3D GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kiss3DGen repurposes 2D diffusion models for efficient 3D object
generation, using multi-view images and normal maps to create
high-quality meshes and textures.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BEATING POKEMON RED WITH 10M PARAMETERS AND RL (45 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Given the excitement around Claude playing Pokemon, this blog post is
quite timely. It explores how to use RL to train a policy to play
Pokemon. It is not a general purpose agent, but works quite well on
the given task. 

 PERFECT TAPS $23M TO FIX THE FLAWS IN RECRUITMENT WITH AI (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Israeli startup Perfect, which aims to streamline recruitment
processes using proprietary AI, raised $23 million in seed funding. It
claims to reduce recruiters' workloads by 25 hours weekly and has
rapidly expanded its client base to 200 companies. Founded by Eylon
Etshtein, the platform uses custom vector datasets, bypassing
third-party LLMs, to provide accurate candidate insights. 

 HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN SOFTWARE WITH AI, NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A tech enthusiast used AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to
successfully create various apps, such as podcast transcription tools
and task managers, despite being a hobbyist. This inspired him to
launch a course, "Build Your Own Life Coach," to teach others how to
build custom software using AI. The self-paced course has already
enrolled nearly 150 students and aims to provide a comprehensive
framework for software development with minimal coding experience.

 SOFYA USES LLAMA FOR HEALTHCARE AI (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Sofya leverages Llama models to streamline medical AI workflows,
improving efficiency and reducing administrative overhead for
healthcare providers in Latin America. 

 EFFICIENT ROBOT MORPHOLOGY (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 BodyGen introduces topology-aware self-attention and a temporal
credit assignment mechanism to enhance the efficiency of robot
morphology and control co-design. 

 META IN TALKS FOR $200 BILLION AI DATA CENTER PROJECT (2 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Meta is in talks to build a $200 billion AI data center campus, with
potential locations including Louisiana, Wyoming, or Texas.
