TLDR AI 2025-09-19

 THERE'S MORE TO AI SUCCESS THAN JUST TOOL CHOICE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Despite bold promises like GitHub Copilot's "55% faster coding", most
companies hit a wall: only 20% of developers actually stick with AI
tools. Throwing more tech at the same people might not be the
solution.

Thoughtworks has developed a framework for AI adoption [4] across five
dimensions: literacy, governance, playbooks, champions, and
experimentation.

Read the blog [4]for a useful roadmap on how to drive measurable
impact with AI - and avoid common anti-patterns that lead to lukewarm
adoption.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHROME: THE BROWSER YOU LOVE, REIMAGINED WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google introduces an AI-centric version of Chrome focused on
productivity and safety. The browser now features Gemini, an AI
assistant that understands context across tabs, and the enhanced
omnibox with AI Mode for complex searches. 

 NVIDIA AND INTEL'S $5 BILLION DEAL IS APPARENTLY ABOUT EATING AMD'S
LUNCH (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia and Intel announced a $5 billion partnership focusing on
creating a superior GPU-CPU SoC integration to compete against AMD.
This collaboration targets the underserved integrated graphics market,
which AMD dominates with its advanced offerings. Nvidia also aims to
become a major Intel CPU customer for servers, challenging AMD's
rising market share in that segment. 

 LUMA AI'S NEW RAY3 VIDEO GENERATOR CAN 'THINK' BEFORE CREATING (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Luma AI's new reasoning video model, Ray3, can create AI video clips
with complex action sequences. It can spend more time working through
prompts, making it better at handling more advanced scenes. The model
can generate clips in 16-bit HDR. It has a draft mode that lets users
test ideas quickly by generating shots in a lower resolution format.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 VERY FEW OF WAYMO'S MOST SERIOUS CRASHES WERE WAYMO'S FAULT (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Out of Waymo's 45 most serious crashes, none were due to failures of
the self-driving software, and 37 were caused by human drivers. Over
96 million miles, Waymos were involved in 34 airbag crashes. Human
drivers average 159 over that same distance. 

 YOU CAN'T EVAL GPT5 ANYMORE (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The GPT-5 API is aware of the date, which is problematic because the
model becomes aware that it is in a simulation when evals are run
against it. There is evidence that models behave differently when they
know they are in a simulation. Some models start questioning other
parts of the simulation once they know they are in a simulation. The
API being aware of the date may be an attempt at patching a safety
risk. 

 CODING AS THE EPICENTER OF AI PROGRESS AND THE PATH TO GENERAL AGENTS
(16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coding is arguably the last tractable, general domain of continued
progress for frontier models that people can interface with. It is a
domain where models are already useful, and they continue to
consistently stack on meaningful improvements. Many developers are
starting to learn a new way of working with AI through new
command-line code agents. Within a few years, autonomous agents will
be functional, and AI will be able to improve the most complex
codebases. 

 DESIGNING NOTEBOOKLM (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The lead designer for NotebookLM explains the UI evolution of the
product, specifically how the team solved “tab overwhelm” by
creating a unified workspace with responsive panels that adapt to
different workflows—reading plus chat, chat plus writing, or reading
plus writing. While the tool itself, like many AI tools, is very
flexible, there is still a linear underlying flow: users import
sources, interact through conversation, then generate structured
outputs like notes and Audio Overviews.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 YOU CAN'T SCALE AI WITHOUT CONTAINERS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 AI workloads demand dynamic scaling, flexible consumption, and
consistent deployment - exactly what containers provide. But managing
thousands of GPUs or TPUs is not trivial. Google Kubernetes Engine
[12] scales to 65,000 nodes, cuts inference costs 30%, and powers AI
at Anthropic and LiveX AI. Learn how your existing Kubernetes
expertise can fuel AI innovation in this ebook by Google [12]. 

 HOW OPENAI USES CODEX (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Every engineering department at OpenAI uses Codex daily. They
emphasize fully utilizing Codex's features, not just talking to it
like a chatbot: use “Ask Mode” before switching to “Code
Mode,” put time into maintaining AGENTS.md files for persistent
context, and use the task queue as a lightweight backlog. 

 DISCOVERING NEW SOLUTIONS TO CENTURY-OLD PROBLEMS IN FLUID DYNAMICS
(6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Mathematicians have for centuries tried to develop complex equations
to describe the fundamental physics involved in fluid dynamics.
However, experts can still carefully craft scenarios that can make
theory go against practice, creating scenarios that could never
physically happen. These situations, also known as 'singularities',
help mathematicians identify fundamental limitations in the equations
of fluid dynamics and help improve their understanding of how the
physical world functions. Researchers recently published an entirely
new family of singularities in some of the most complex equations that
describe fluid motion. Their approach presents a new way to leverage
AI techniques to tackle longstanding challenges in mathematics,
physics, and engineering that demand unprecedented accuracy and
interpretability.

 UNLIKE LLMS, WE CAN'T SCRAPE THE INTERNET FOR ROBOT DATA (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Project Go-Big aims to build the world's largest humanoid pretraining
dataset. It is training robots directly from human video data. Its
humanoid robots learn navigation end-to-end using only human video.
Examples of the videos the robots are training on are available in the
thread. 

 HARD DISK UNEXPECTEDLY NOT DEAD (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 While progress has been made in DNA storage, the technology is still
many decades away from competing with the hard disk. The research
isn't a waste of resources, as it will eventually be feasible and
economic. Time-scales in the storage industry are long. Bandwidth and
cost remain the core problems of DNA storage.
