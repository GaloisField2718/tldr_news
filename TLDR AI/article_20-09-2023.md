Before going all-in on AI, you need data that‚Äôs AI-ready. The
semantic layer has a big role to play here ‚Äî providing a single view
of critical business metrics (e.g. ARR, headcount) and common
analytics vocabulary across various groups.

OPENAI LAUNCHES A RED TEAMING NETWORK (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/19/openai-launches-a-red-teaming-network-to-make-its-models-more-robust/?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI has introduced the OpenAI Red Teaming Network, a group of
experts that will assist in assessing and mitigating the risks
associated with its AI models. 

ANYSCALE OPTIMIZES OPEN SOURCE AI DEPLOYMENTS WITH ENDPOINTS (5 MINUTE
READ)
[https://venturebeat.com/ai/anyscale-optimizes-open-source-ai-deployments-with-endpoints/?utm_source=tldrai]

Anyscale has unveiled Endpoints, which allows developers to integrate
fast, cost-efficient, and scalable LLMs into their applications using
popular LLM APIs. The company also announced a new integration with
NVIDIA to boost the performance and development of LLMs on Ray,
Anyscale‚Äôs open-source framework for distributed machine learning. 

BARD CAN NOW FIND ANSWERS IN YOUR GMAIL, DOCS, AND DRIVE (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23878999/google-bard-ai-chatbot-gmail-docs-drive-extensions?utm_source=tldrai]

Google's Bard chatbot can now scan Gmail, Docs, and Drive to retrieve
information and perform tasks. Google says these new integrations,
called extensions, aim to save users time when searching for specific
information within their documents and emails.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

6T MULTILINGUAL TOKENS (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09400?utm_source=tldrai]

Hot on the heels of Google's new dataset comes CulturaX. A cleaned
dataset of trillions of multilingual tokens will be a great boost for
multilingual language models. 

IMPROVING TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09466v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Turning long texts into images can be tough, especially when there are
lots of items or details to show. This new method breaks down long
descriptions into simpler steps and makes sure each detail fits
perfectly in the picture, setting a new high standard for creating
images from text. 

MAKING DEPTH ESTIMATION MORE FLEXIBLE (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09975v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Figuring out 3D depth from a single 2D image is tricky because many 3D
scenes can look the same in 2D. This method separates camera details
from the picture's content, making it easier to guess the depth in
various situations.

[https://github.com/projectnuwa/layoutnuwa?utm_source=tldrai]

Creating eye-catching designs online is important for getting users
interested and helping them understand information. This new method,
called LayoutNUWA, makes these designs smarter by using language
models to turn coding instructions into awesome layouts. 

DOLA: A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE LANGUAGE MODELS STICK TO THE FACTS (23
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03883?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have introduced a new method called DoLa that helps large
language models (like the ones that chat with you or write articles)
stop making stuff up and stick to the facts. It uses a smart way of
comparing different layers inside the model to filter out false
information.

STATE-OF-THE-ART BACKGROUND REMOVAL IN HF TRANSFORMERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/ViTMatte/Quick_inference_with_ViTMatte_for_image_matting.ipynb?utm_source=tldrai]

Matting is the process of creating a black-and-white mask to segment
out important parts of an image. It is usually used for foreground and
background segmentation. The portrait mode on smartphones uses a
method similar to ViTMatte described here. 

GOOGLE‚ÄôS AI PROTEIN FOLDER IDS STRUCTURE WHERE NONE SEEMINGLY
EXISTED (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/googles-ai-software-brings-order-to-protein-chaos/?utm_source=tldrai]

Google‚Äôs AlphaFold played a crucial role in determining the specific
