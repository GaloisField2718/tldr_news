FULL-LENGTH SONG GENERATION WITH LATENT DIFFUSION (21 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Latent diffusion for full length song generation. The results aren't
as good as the best closed models, but this system is likely a good
approximation for the underlying models used by many commercial
offerings. 

 A MILLION-SCALE DATASET FOR TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This dataset was curated to have minimal overlap with existing video
datasets while including themes and actions that users training models
might be interested in for final video synthesis and understanding.
All videos are collected from the official YouTube creator API and are
CC licensed. 

 ENHANCED MULTI-OBJECTIVE RL (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This novel reward dimension reduction method enhances learning
efficiency in multi-objective reinforcement learning, scaling beyond
conventional approaches.

 LOSSLESS ACCELERATION OF ULTRA LONG SEQUENCE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO)
[10] 

 Framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process
of ultra-long sequences, up to 100K tokens, while maintaining the
target model's inherent quality. 

 ACTION PLANNER FOR OFFLINE RL (19 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 L-MAP improves sequential decision-making in stochastic,
high-dimensional continuous action spaces by learning macro-actions
via a VQ-VAE model. 

 VARGPT (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 VARGPT is a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that unifies
visual understanding and generation within a single autoregressive

 DID XAI LIE ABOUT GROK 3'S BENCHMARKS? (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 An OpenAI employee has accused Elon Musk's xAI of publishing
misleading benchmark results for Grok 3 by omitting the "cons@64"
metric, which boosts scores. xAI's graph suggested that Grok 3 was
superior to OpenAI's models, but omitted the enhancement that OpenAI's
models benefitted from. This dispute highlights ongoing issues with AI
benchmarks and reporting transparency. 

 WILL AI AGENTS REPLACE SAAS? (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI agents might complement but won't fully replace SaaS platforms, as
they still require a robust infrastructure for data and functionality.
While AI agents offer automation and insights, they'll need human
oversight for nuanced decision-making and innovation. The future
likely involves a hybrid model that enhances SaaS through AI
capabilities while addressing challenges related to integration,
trust, and accountability.
