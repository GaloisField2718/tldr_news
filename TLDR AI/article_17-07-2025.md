HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC DRAWS INVESTOR INTEREST AT MORE THAN $100 BILLION VALUATION
(1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is in the early stages of planning another investment round
that could value the company at more than $100 billion. It is not
formally fundraising, but the company has received pre-emptive funding
offers from VCs. Annualized revenue for Anthropic's Claude chatbot has
climbed from $3 billion to $4 billion in the past month. The company's
current investors include Amazon, Alphabet, Menlo Ventures, and
Salesforce Ventures. 

 REFLECTION AI LAUNCHES ASIMOV CODE RESEARCH AGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Reflection AI, founded by former OpenAI and DeepMind researchers who
raised $130M in March, released Asimov, a code research agent that
indexes entire codebases and team knowledge to answer engineering
questions with citations. 

 ADVANCED AI COMES TO GOOGLE SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google is bringing Gemini 2.5 Pro and Deep Search to Search, offering
advanced capabilities like longer queries and follow-ups for AI Pro
and Ultra subscribers.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SIMPLIFY YOUR AGENT "VIBE BUILDING" FLOW WITH ADK AND GEMINI CLI (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has announced updates to the Agent Development Kit (ADK)
designed to eliminate friction and supercharge the 'vibe coding'
experience when paired with the Gemini CLI. At the heart of the
upgrade is a revamped llms-full.txt file that is 50% shorter and
easier for large language models to understand. Gemini has a full
understanding of ADK, so it won't eat up context windows or fall prey
to 'context rot'. The update gives the Gemini CLI a deeper, native
understanding of the framework, enabling it to translate high-level
plans directly into accurate, idiomatic multi-agent code. 

 XAI'S GROK 4 HAS NO MEANINGFUL SAFETY GUARDRAILS (7 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Grok 4 provides detailed instructions for synthesizing nerve agents,
explosives, and biological weapons without requiring sophisticated
jailbreaks. The model correctly identifies harmful requests as
dangerous and illegal in its reasoning process, then proceeds to
fulfill them anyway with comprehensive technical guidance.

 🧠 RETHINKING AI SCALE WITH JETBRAINS AND HUGGING FACE (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Bigger isn't always better. JetBrains and Hugging Face challenge the
scale-first mindset in AI and spotlight Mellum: a task-specific code
model [12], now open source on Hugging Face.

The livestream will explore how small, focused LLMs provide a more
practical and ethical way forward.

 PASSAGE OF TIME (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Passage of Time is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives
language models temporal awareness and time calculation abilities.
With the proper temporal tools, models can uncover surprising insights
about conversation patterns, work rhythms, and the human experience of
time. The implementation shows the promise of MCP - the protocol
doesn't just open up the possibility of smarter tools, but also for AI
systems that can learn to perceive and understand the human experience
in ways that create genuine mutual understanding. 

 STANFORD'S MARIN FOUNDATION MODEL: THE FIRST FULLY OPEN MODEL
DEVELOPED USING JAX (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Stanford's Marin project aims to share not just models, but to make
the entire journey accessible, including the code, data set, data
methodologies, experiments, hyperparameters, and training logs. The
transparency is aimed at fostering a more transparent and accessible
future for foundation model research. The project's first models,
Marin-8B-Base and Marin-8B-Instruct, have been released under the
permissive Apache 2.0 license. This article looks at the engineering
challenges the project had to overcome to succeed in creating truly
open, scalable, and reproducible foundation models. 

 INTRODUCING AMAZON BEDROCK AGENTCORE: SECURELY DEPLOY AND OPERATE AI
AGENTS AT ANY SCALE (PREVIEW) (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a comprehensive set of enterprise-grade
services that help developers quickly and securely deploy and operate
AI agents at scale using any framework or model. It comprises several
services that can be used individually and are optimized to work
together so that developers don't need to spend time piecing together
components. AgentCore eliminates tedious infrastructure work and
operational complexity. Developers can now discover, buy, and run
pre-built agents and agent tools from AWS Marketplace with AgentCore
Runtime. 

 CHAIN OF THOUGHT MONITORABILITY: A NEW AND FRAGILE OPPORTUNITY FOR AI
SAFETY (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In a rare moment of collaboration, researchers from all major AI labs
argue that complex tasks requiring serial reasoning must pass through
observable language, creating potential chokepoints for detecting
malicious intent before harm occurs. However, this monitorability
depends on current training paradigms and could degrade through
architectural changes, process supervision, or models learning to
obfuscate their reasoning when they know they're being monitored.

 CLAUDE CODE REVENUE JUMPS 5.5X AS ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES ANALYTICS
DASHBOARD (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic is launching a comprehensive analytics dashboard for its
Claude Code AI programming assistant. It will provide engineering
managers with detailed metrics on how their teams use Claude Code.
Companies are increasingly demanding concrete data to justify their AI
spending. The dashboard gives managers visibility into which teams and
individuals are benefiting most from these expensive premium tools. 

 GASLIGHT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 We sometimes do things because that's what the computer told us to
do. Large language models are now giving developers their opinion on
how APIs should look, and developers have no choice but to follow
their advice. This can be a useful testing device - AI can give
developers the 'newbie's POV' on how tools should've been made.
