 OPENAI'S NEW MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced a new model called GPT-4o (o is for omni) that
is a natively multimodal model, with superior performance to GPT-4 on
text and state-of-the-art performance on a variety of modalities. It
also announced a new desktop app, a near real-time audio interface,
and a variety of improved reasoning features. 

 IBM OPEN SOURCES THE GRANITE CODE MODELS (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 IBM is releasing its Granite code models, which range from 3 to 34
billion parameters and cover a variety of programming tasks, to the
open-source community to facilitate easier and more efficient coding
across numerous platforms. 

 APPLE FINALIZING DEAL TO BRING CHATGPT FEATURES TO THE IPHONE (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple is nearing an agreement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT
technology into the iPhone, potentially featuring it in the upcoming
iOS 18 as part of its AI enhancements.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MATTERSIM: A DEEP LEARNING ATOMISTIC MODEL ACROSS ELEMENTS,
TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Simulators can be powerful tools in AI for collecting training data
or for model learning interactions. This simulator can be used to
model different atomic interactions across a variety of elements. 

 SCENE GRAPH GENERATION WITH TRANSFORMERS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed a new method for creating scene graphs,
making it faster and more efficient. Their transformer-based technique
focuses on improving the way the model understands and connects
different elements in an image, leading to better performance on
challenging tasks. 

 TEXT-IMAGE COMPOSITION AND COMPREHENSION (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 InternLM-XComposer2 is a vision-language model that excels in
creating and understanding complex text-image content. It introduces a
Partial LoRA approach for a balanced vision and text comprehension,
outperforming existing models in multimodal content creation and
understanding.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WHAT A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO GENAI LOOKS LIKE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 For enterprises, there's a lot on the line [11] with genAI. It has
immense potential for new revenue, cost savings, and improved
products; but there are many risks and unknowns that need to be
mitigated to avoid disaster. This white paper by Domino [11] covers
toolsets, processes, and actionable steps to get started with
responsible genAI. Read it here [11] 

 PIPECAT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A framework for building voice (and multimodal) conversational
agents. 

 EXPANDED MRI SCAN CAPABILITIES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MRSegmentator is a new tool designed to enhance MRI scan
segmentation, effectively identifying 40 different organs and
structures across the abdominal, pelvic, and thorax regions. 

 AN IMPROVED LONG-TERM FORECASTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Time-Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) is a novel deep learning
model designed to enhance long-term time series forecasting. It
combines information fusion and evidence theory, utilizing a
specialized module to improve prediction accuracy and stability. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOONDREAM COYO CAPTIONS (HUGGING FACE HUB) [15] 

 5M novel captions based on the alt-text and images of a portion of
the COYO dataset. 

 WEBLLAMA (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 A model designed to browse the web and answer questions accordingly.
This could be used to synthesize a high-quality pretraining dataset or
perform research that requires querying information from a web page. 

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AS RESEARCH ASSISTANTS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI tools like GPT-4 are increasingly assisting and even outperforming
academics in tasks like writing research papers. Liang et al. found up
to 18% of papers in some fields are AI-assisted. This integration of
AI could create a loop where software both generates and reviews
academic publications. However, the impact on scientific progress is
nuanced - it could potentially enable more productivity but there is
also a risk of a phase where more is produced with less understanding.
