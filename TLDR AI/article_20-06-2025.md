 ALGOLIA'S NEW MCP SERVER MAKES AI SEARCH A BREEZE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Tired of spending valuable time analyzing, monitoring and searching
through your index? Algolia's new MCP server [4] makes these tasks
simple.

AI agents can now easily handle prompts like:

 	* "Search my 'products' index for Nike shoes under $100."
 	* "Add the top 10 programming books to my 'library' index using
their ISBNs as objectIDs."
 	* "Show me the top 10 searches with no results in the DE region from
last week.‚Äù

More than 18,000 customers across 150+ countries use Algolia to deploy
fast, scalable search in their applications and websites.

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS GPT-5 COMING THIS SUMMER, OPEN TO ADS ON CHATGPT (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Early testers are calling GPT-5 "materially better" than GPT-4,
though Sam Altman gave no specific launch date for the new model
beyond summer. Altman floated advertising possibilities but drew a
hard line against letting payments influence responses, suggesting ads
might appear outside the model's output stream. 

 MINIMAX'S HAILUO 02 TOPS GOOGLE VEO 3 IN USER BENCHMARKS AT MUCH
LOWER VIDEO COSTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MiniMax's second-generation video AI model, Hailuo 02, features major
upgrades in both performance and price. It uses an architecture called
Noise-aware Compute Redistribution that improves training and
inference efficiency by a factor of 2.5. The architecture handles long
video sequences differently depending on the stage of training. Hailuo
02 has three times more parameters and four times more training data
compared to its previous version. A video generated with the model is
available in the article.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 INFERENCE ECONOMICS OF LANGUAGE MODELS (35 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The first comprehensive model of LLM serving economics reveals why
current approaches to scaling inference hit walls faster than
expected, as AI companies race to serve token-intensive reasoning
models and agents. Network latency, not bandwidth, creates the primary
bottleneck that prevents companies from simply adding more GPUs to
increase capacity. Algorithmic breakthroughs like speculative
decoding, which delivers double the speed at no additional cost,
continue to reshape the economic landscape as providers struggle to
match surging demand. 

 RETHINKING RECOMMENDATION & SEARCH IN LLM ERA (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Recommendation and search systems are shifting from item IDs to rich
"Semantic IDs," generative retrieval, and multimodal embeddings,
enabling cold‚Äëstart coverage, long‚Äëtail discovery, and unified
search‚Äërecs architectures that scale efficiently. 

 COMPILING LLMS INTO A MEGAKERNEL: A PATH TO LOW-LATENCY INFERENCE (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional large language model (LLM) systems often rely on
sequences of GPU kernel launches and external communications calls,
which results in underutilized hardware. This post discusses how a
team created a compiler that automatically transforms LLM inference
into a single megakernel, which eliminates launch overhead, enables
fine-grained software pipelining, and overlaps computation with
communication across GPUs. The end-to-end GPU fusion approach reduces
LLM inference latency by 1.2 to 6.7 times.

 CHANGES MADE TO THE MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This document lists major changes made to the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) specification since the previous revision, 2025-03-26. Some of
the changes include the removal of support for JSON-RPC batching, the
added support for structured tool output, and the clarification of
security considerations and best practices in the authorization spec.
A link to the complete list of all changes is available. 

 IMPROVING FINE-GRAINED SUBWORD UNDERSTANDING IN LLMS (15 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 StochasTok randomly decomposes tokens during training: instead of
always seeing "strawberry" as one unit, models encounter it split as
"straw|berry," "str|awberry," or even "s|t|r|a|w|b|e|r|r|y," learning
the internal structure humans naturally perceive. Models trained with
this method achieve near-perfect accuracy on character counting and
multi-digit math while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks.


 IMPROVING NATURALNESS IN GENERATIVE SPOKEN LANGUAGE MODELS (16 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 An end‚Äëto‚Äëend variational encoder that augments semantic speech
tokens with automatically learned prosodic features, removing
hand‚Äëengineered pitch inputs and yielding more natural continuations
in human preference tests. 

 DETECTING UNLEARNING TRACES IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Machine‚Äëunlearned LLMs leave detectable behavioral and
activation‚Äëspace "fingerprints". Simple classifiers can spot
unlearning with >90‚ÄØ% accuracy, raising privacy and copyright
concerns.

 SIX-MONTH-OLD, SOLO-OWNED VIBE CODER BASE44 SELLS TO WIX FOR $80M
CASH (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Israeli developer Maor Shlomo recently sold his six-month-old,
bootstrapped vibe-coding startup, Base44, to Wix for $80 million cash.
His eight employees will collectively receive $25 million of the $80
million as a 'retention' bonus. Base44 grew to 250,000 users in six
months. It generated $189,000 in profit in May even after covering
high LLM token costs. The startup grew mostly through word of mouth. 

 ANDREJ KARPATHY ON HOW AI IS CHANGING SOFTWARE (39 MINUTE VIDEO) [16]


 Andrej Karpathy argues we're entering "Software 3.0" where LLMs
function as cloud-based operating systems programmable through English
- best captured by his concept of "vibe coding". Rather than pursuing
full autonomous AI agents, he advocates for "autonomy sliders" in
tools like Cursor that offset AI limitations through human oversight,
and emphasizes the need for LLM-friendly documentation as AI agents
become major consumers of digital information.
