DISCORD IS TESTING CHATGPT-POWERED CLYDE CHATBOT AND OTHER AI FEATURES
(6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23631930/discord-openai-clyde-chatbot-automod-features-ai?utm_source=tldrai]


Discord is now using OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT technology to transform its
existing Clyde bot into a talkative chatbot. Clyde is being upgraded
next week to answer questions and have conversations with users, much
like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT or Microsoft‚Äôs Bing chat feature. It‚Äôs
part of a broader push for AI in Discord, which also includes
AI-generated conversation summaries and the ability for Discord admins
to leverage AI technology to moderate servers. 

OPEN SOURCE CHATGPT REPLICATION TRAINED ON 43 MILLION INSTRUCTIONS (4
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit?utm_source=tldrai] 

One of the reasons chatGPT is so powerful is because of the
instruction tuning process. By feeding the model data formatted as
instructions, it becomes much more likely to follow instructions that
users give it. Openchatkit is a 20 billion parameter instruction tuned
Transformer and other useful tools to make an open source replication
of the powerful and popular chatbot. 

GPT-4 IS COMING NEXT WEEK SAYS MICROSOFT GERMANY (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.heise.de/news/GPT-4-is-coming-next-week-and-it-will-be-multimodal-says-Microsoft-Germany-7540972.html?utm_source=tldrai]


From Andreas Braun, CTO of Microsoft Germany: ‚ÄúWe will introduce
GPT-4 next week, there we will have multimodal models that will offer
completely different possibilities ‚Äì for example videos,‚Äù Braun
said. The CTO called LLM a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù because they teach
machines to understand natural language, which then understand in a
statistical way what was previously only readable and understandable
by humans.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

CHERRY PICKING ROBOT WITH ONLY 30 MIN OF INTERACTION DATA (7 MINUTE
READ) [https://goodcherrybot.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Data efficiency is one of the challenges of many reinforcement
learning algorithms. It usually takes millions of environmental
interactions before the agent starts to learn. This is often
infeasible with real world robotic systems. This work is one example
of a system that is more data efficient. 

PIXMIM: A SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR MASKED IMAGE MODELING (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02416?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes PixMIM, a simple and effective method for Masked
Image Modeling (MIM) that addresses two previously overlooked
bottlenecks. PixMIM filters high-frequency components from the
reconstruction target and adopts a conservative data transform
strategy to alleviate the problem of missing foreground in MIM
training. The method can be easily integrated into most existing
pixel-based MIM approaches, improving three MIM approaches
consistently across various downstream tasks without additional
computation. PixMIM can serve as a strong baseline for self-supervised
learning and provide insights for future improvements of the MIM
framework.

RUN STATE OF THE ART LANGUAGE MODELS ON YOUR LAPTOP (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp?utm_source=tldrai] 

By taking advantage of the new Apple neural computing system, you can
run the llama models on m1 and m2 computers. You can even get many
tokens per second for the smallest model. This points at an exciting
future of personalized AI running on consumer grade hardware. 

DEAD SIMPLE WAY TO RUN LANGUAGE MODELS (2 MINUTE READ)

Powered by the above code, this project packages things up nicely and
allows you to install and run the llama models with familiar web tools
like npx.

COMBINE PEFT WITH RLHF (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/trl-peft?utm_source=tldrai] 

Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a way to update only a small
fraction of the weights of a model. Reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a similar step to instruction tuning that improves
model generation quality and model alignment. By combining the two,
you can tune large models up to 20 billion parameters on a relatively
small GPU with 24GB of on chip memory. This process would usually
require multiple A100s. 

CHATGPT‚ÄôS API MAKES MOST TEXT GENERATING AI OBSOLETE (12 MINUTE
READ)
[https://minimaxir.com/2023/03/new-chatgpt-overlord/?utm_source=tldrai]


ChatGPT‚Äôs API is really good, and it‚Äôs so cheap that it‚Äôs making
most other text generating AI models obsolete. On March 1st, OpenAI
set the price of the ChatGPT API to 1/10th of the GPT-3 API, at
$0.002/1,000 tokens. Combine this with how customizable the models are
with prompt engineering, and you have a technology that will disrupt
many industries.
