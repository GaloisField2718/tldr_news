MISCELLANEOUS

 DRAKE USES AI TUPAC AND SNOOP DOGG VOCALS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Drake's new song "Taylor Made Freestyle" features AI-generated vocals
of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg aimed at Kendrick Lamar amidst their
ongoing hip-hop feud. The song's AI manipulation prompts speculation
about the technology's role in shaping the diss exchange in the
hip-hop community. 

 WHY RELIABLE AI REQUIRES A PARADIGM SHIFT (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI hallucinations, when AI models generate plausible but incorrect
outputs, pose a significant challenge and cannot be fully solved with
current technologies. These issues stem from the fundamental design of
generative AI, which relies on recognizing patterns in data but lacks
an understanding of truth, leading to random occurrences of misleading
information. 

 SHOULD APPLE KILL SIRI AND START OVER? (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Despite incremental updates to Apple's Siri since its 2011 launch,
the voice assistant lags behind its rivals, leading to calls for a
major overhaul or replacement. Persistent issues with Siri's
functionality have degraded its reputation, with user frustrations
mounting over its poor contextual understanding.
