 GET THE WORLD'S FASTEST WHISPER INFERENCE WITH BASETEN (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Baseten's model performance engineers have built the world's fastest
inference engine for Whisper, the best open-source audio transcription
(speech-to-text) AI model.

➡️ Over 400x real-time factor (1 hour transcribed in <9 seconds)

➡️ Best word error rate with domain-specific corrections

➡️ Lowest cost per hour for Whisper V3 (up to 80% cheaper than
OpenAI)

This is the fastest, most accurate, least expensive Whisper inference
on the market, counting custom hardware providers.

ML engineering teams at AI-native companies like Bland AI
[5] and Patreon [6] trust Baseten for mission-critical Whisper
inference thanks to:

✅ Secure and HIPAA-compliant dedicated deployments

✅ Best-in-class reliability and observability

✅ Optional self-hosted deployments to customer VPCs

 OPENAI CO-FOUNDER GREG BROCKMAN RETURNS AFTER THREE MONTHS OF LEAVE
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman has returned to OpenAI as president,
following a sabbatical, amid significant executive departures and
controversy over its shift to a for-profit model. OpenAI recently
secured a $157 billion valuation in its latest funding round. The
company is facing internal challenges as leaders like Mira Murati, Bob
McGrew, and Lilian Weng have left. 

 EUROPEAN GOOGLE RIVALS PARTNER ON SEARCH ENGINE INFRASTRUCTURE TO
COUNTER BIG TECH (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ecosia and Qwant are partnering to build a European search index to
reduce reliance on U.S. Big Tech and enhance AI capabilities. The
venture utilizes a "privacy-first" approach and aims to support
advancements in AI through a new search infrastructure. Alternative
search providers are facing rising API costs - this move positions
them to better compete amid the growing influence of generative AI in
search.

 DATACHAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 DataChain is a Pythonic data-frame library for AI that allows
efficient processing and organization of unstructured data into
datasets without abstracting AI models. It supports integration with
AI tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and LLM APIs, enabling operations
such as metadata generation, filtering, and vector search. The library
also features built-in parallelization, out-of-memory compute, and
vectorized operations on Python object fields. 

 OASIS: A UNIVERSE IN A TRANSFORMER (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Oasis is a fully AI-generated, real-time open-world video game model
that uses a 500M parameter foundation model without a game engine. It
employs fast transformer inference for generating gameplay and is
optimized for Etched's Sohu ASIC to achieve high frame rate
efficiencies. While demonstrating significant potential, challenges
such as domain generalization and long-context consistency remain. 

 BROWSER-USE (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This open-source web automation tool allows LLMs to interact with
websites via a simplified interface. It supports models like GPT-4o
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Key features include multi-tab management,
XPath extraction, and customizable actions. The tool enables seamless
web navigation and data extraction. Its limitations include message
length, which affects LLM speed and task repetition. Ongoing
development will focus on robustness and cost reduction.
