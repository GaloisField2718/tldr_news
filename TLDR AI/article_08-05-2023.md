HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

FITTING THE GREAT GATSBY IN CONTEXT (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b?utm_source=tldrai] 

Language models take text queries as input and output text responses.
The length of both query and output are referred to as the context.
Language models have limited context length (ChatGPT is 8k 'words').
With some cool recent algorithmic changes, MosaicML has released a
model that can operate in 65k 'words'. This is enough to fit the
entire novel Great Gatsby in context and have the model write an
epilogue. 

OPENAI‚ÄôS REGULATORY TROUBLES ARE JUST BEGINNING (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/5/23709833/openai-chatgpt-gdpr-ai-regulation-europe-eu-italy?utm_source=tldrai]


The Verge discusses the challenges OpenAI faces in complying with the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for
ChatGPT. The Italian Data Protection Authority recently questioned the
use of AI-generated content under GDPR, leading to concerns about how
AI companies should proceed in the EU market. The article highlights
the importance of balancing innovation in AI with ensuring user
privacy and data protection, as GDPR compliance becomes increasingly
crucial for companies operating within the EU. 

THIS COMPANY ADOPTED AI. HERE‚ÄôS WHAT HAPPENED TO IT‚ÄôS HUMAN
WORKERS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2023/05/02/1172791281/this-company-adopted-ai-heres-what-happened-to-its-human-workers?utm_source=tldrai]


NPR's article discusses a company that adopted AI and how it impacted
human workers. The implementation led to increased efficiency and
changed some job roles, but it didn't result in job loss. Instead,
employees were upskilled to work alongside AI.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

AI CHAT ASSISTANTS CAN IMPROVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DIVISIVE TOPICS (23
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07268?utm_source=tldrai] 

We live in a somewhat divisive world and it's hard to have meaningful
conversations where understanding is fostered. Interestingly, if you
have an AI chatbot intermediate conversations about difficult topics -
both parties report improved outcomes and understanding. 

ZIPIT, MERGING MODELS TRAINED ON DIFFERENT TASKS (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03053?utm_source=tldrai] 

Let's say we have two different models of the same architecture
trained on different tasks. Is it possible to merge them into a single
model that works well on both tasks? Current methods like rebasin or
model soup don't work because of the presence of different
task-specific features. This new work proposes a way forward with the
two step process which improves as much as 60% over previous
algorithms. 

TEXT TO 3D WITH SHAP-E (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463?utm_source=tldrai] 

OpenAI has quietly been working on text to 3D with a few releases.
This new work is a fun addition to that line of research. It works
fairly well in standard objects or objects with a few compositional
ideas. This model can also create 3D objects from 2D images, although
that doesn't seem to work quite as well.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

HIPOOL: MODELING LONG DOCUMENTS USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (13 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03319?utm_source=tldrai] 

Encoding long chunks of text is a tough task for natural language
processing (NLP) models. This study improves the process by using
graphs and a new attention mechanism, which helps the model understand
relationships between sentences and perform better on longer
sequences. 

IMPROVING AI COMMONSENSE UNDERSTANDING (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03695?utm_source=tldrai] 

Today's language models can still make silly mistakes when it comes to
commonsense knowledge. VERA is a new model that estimates the
plausibility of statements based on commonsense, helping to filter out
incorrect information and improve performance in real-world settings. 

OTTER: A MULTI-MODAL MODEL WITH IN-CONTEXT INSTRUCTION TUNING (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/Luodian/Otter?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study introduces a new method, called MIMIC-IT, for improving how
models like Otter understand and follow instructions in different
situations, including images and text. By making these models more
accessible, researchers can use them more easily to create better AI
systems. 

üëã GOODBYE LOW TEST COVERAGE AND SLOW QA CYCLES (SPONSOR)

TOWARDS A FOUNDATION MODEL FOR BIOLOGY (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.30.538439v1?utm_source=tldrai]


Large pretrained models are exciting in text, can we build one for
single cell tasks in biology? scGPT is a transformer that excels at
different biology related tasks. It's open and you can download the
weights. 

CHATGPT IS POWERED BY THESE CONTRACTORS MAKING $15/HOUR (6 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/openai-chatgpt-ai-jobs-contractors-talk-shadow-workforce-powers-rcna81892?utm_source=tldrai]


The NBC News article delves into the role of the shadow workforce
behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. This workforce consists of contractors
responsible for refining and maintaining the AI system. The article
sheds light on the human effort involved in the development and
functioning of AI models like ChatGPT, as contractors review and rate
potential outputs to train the AI model. Despite being a significant
part of the development process, these contractors often remain in the
background and are less acknowledged in comparison to full-time
employees. 

AI‚ÄôS BIGGEST RISK IS THE CORPORATIONS THAT CONTROL THEM (5 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.fastcompany.com/90892235/researcher-meredith-whittaker-says-ais-biggest-risk-isnt-consciousness-its-the-corporations-that-control-them?utm_source=tldrai]


Fast Company's article features an interview with Meredith Whittaker,
a leading AI researcher and founder of the AI Now Institute. Whittaker
emphasizes that the real risk in AI doesn't come from consciousness or
superintelligence, but rather from the corporations that control these
technologies. She argues that AI is deeply embedded in societal and
economic systems, and thus, its impact is largely determined by the
motivations and priorities of corporations that develop and deploy AI.
The article highlights the importance of considering the power
dynamics and socio-political context in which AI operates in order to
understand and mitigate potential risks.
