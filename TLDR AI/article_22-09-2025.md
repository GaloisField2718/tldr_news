 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Ditch the IT bottleneck: AI agents are ready to deploy across
departments. Think "collaborative playground" with invisible
guardrails. Airia [4] lets every department build out their own use
cases with security and governance baked-in:

 	* Use templates and no-code to RAPIDLY PROTOTYPE, DEPLOY, AND MANAGE
AI AGENTS that transform workflows across your organization
 	* Bring your own data and LLM [4] with built-in connectors to DOZENS
OF ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS and LLM tools
 	* Add SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE with controls, audit trails, and
responsible guardrails to protect sensitive data
 	* OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE AND COSTS through smart routing and
centralized lifecycle management

 MUSK'S XAI REPORTEDLY RAISING $10 BILLION AT $200 BILLION VALUATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI was valued at $150 billion a few weeks ago and $80 billion when
it merged with X in March, though Musk later called the report “fake
news.” 

 GROK 4 FAST (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Grok 4 Fast is comparable to Grok 4 but uses 40% fewer thinking
tokens and features the first 2 million token context window. 

 ORACLE EYES $20 BILLION AI CLOUD COMPUTING DEAL WITH META, SOURCE
SAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Oracle is in talks with Meta for a multi-year cloud computing deal
worth about $20 billion that would see Oracle provide Meta with
computing capacity for training and deploying AI models. Oracle
unveiled four multi-billion-dollar contracts last week. It expects to
sign up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in the next
few months. Booked revenue at its OCI business will exceed half a
trillion dollars.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 FLOODING THE AI FRONTIER (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese models are dominating the open-weight LLM space. Some of the
models compete with or even outperform leading proprietary US models
on common benchmarks. The Chinese government is promoting open models
as part of its AI strategy. Flooding the market with free high-quality
AI models helps China build its AI capabilities while making it harder
for the US to sustain its lead. 

 THE EXTREME INEFFICIENCY OF RL FOR FRONTIER MODELS (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A key difference between pre-training and reinforcement learning (RL)
is their information efficiency. Pre-training via
next-token-prediction provides models with a token worth of
information to learn from for every token the model produces during
training, while RL requires a long chain of thousands and even
millions of tokens before revealing to the model a single bit of
information. RL provides models with much less information to learn
from per GPU-hour. This has serious implications for how much the RL
paradigm can achieve. 

 WHAT GPT-OSS LEAKS ABOUT OPENAI'S TRAINING DATA (21 MINUTE READ) [10]


 GPT-oss' weights are openly available, but the sources of training
data are not clearly described in the model card. This article takes a
look at the model's parameters to find out what the model was trained
on. There is strong evidence that the models in the GPT-5 and GPT-oss
family were trained on phrases from adult websites. There is weak
evidence that part of the GPT training corpus was scraped off GitHub. 

 A POSTMORTEM OF THREE RECENT ISSUES (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Between August and September, three overlapping infrastructure bugs
caused Claude to produce degraded responses, including random foreign
characters, misrouted requests to wrong server configurations, and an
XLA compiler issue that dropped high-probability tokens.

 CALLRAIL'S HUMAN-LIKE AI VOICE ASSISTANT HELPS BUSINESSES CAPTURES
LEADS 24/7 (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Voice assistants used to be glorified answering machines. Today,
CallRail's AI Voice Assistant fields calls more fluently than most
humans, capturing details that help businesses qualify leads while
giving consumers answers faster. Try it yourself in a live call or 14
day free trial [12], or start by reading the blog [12]. 

 DETECTING AND MITIGATING AI SCHEMING (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenAI and Apollo Research evaluated frontier models for hidden
misalignment behaviors and developed early-stage methods to reduce
deceptive tendencies. 

 LLM-DEFLATE: EXTRACTING LLMS INTO DATASETS (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Large language models compress massive amounts of training data into
their parameters. This process can be reversed: structured data sets
can be systematically extracted from trained models. This post
discusses a decompression technique that can generate substantial
training data sets from open-source models. The key is treating
inference as a knowledge extraction tool rather than just a generation
mechanism.

 NVIDIA JUST SPENT OVER $900 MILLION TO HIRE ENFABRICA CEO, LICENSE AI
STARTUP'S TECHNOLOGY (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia paid $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and other employees
and to license the company's technology. Enfabrica's Technology can
connect more than 100,000 GPUs together. It could help Nvidia offer
integrated systems around its chips so clusters can effectively serve
as a single computer. Nvidia had previously invested in Enfabrica as
part of a $125 million Series B round in 2023. 

 EMAD MOSTAQUE ON THE END OF CAPITALISM (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Emad Mostaque, former hedge fund manager and creator of Stable
Diffusion, recently appeared in an interview where he discussed how
Capitalism is about to become obsolete because of AI. He also talked
about how AI will fundamentally transform the economy, replacing
workers and making traditional economic structures obsolete - within
1,000 days. He advises people to build network capital and master AI
now because human cognitive labor will become economically worthless
soon.
