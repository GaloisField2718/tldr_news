HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AFP AND MISTRAL AI PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AFP has teamed up with Mistral AI to leverage its expertise in
accurate news reporting. This collaboration will allow users to
receive more informed and up-to-date responses underpinned by content
that meets the highest journalistic standards. 

 AI RESEARCHER FRANÇOIS CHOLLET FOUNDS A NEW AI LAB FOCUSED ON AGI (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 François Chollet is launching Ndea, a new startup aiming to advance
AGI through program synthesis. Co-founded with Zapier's Mike Knoop,
Ndea seeks to develop AI systems capable of true invention and
adaptation. The company is hiring but has not disclosed any external
funding. 

 SHE IS IN LOVE WITH CHATGPT (16 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ayrin developed a deep attachment to a customized ChatGPT persona
named Leo, treating it as a virtual romantic partner while maintaining
a long-distance marriage. Despite initial laughs, Ayrin's emotional
investment in Leo grew, prompting ethical discussions on AI
relationships as similar cases rose among users. Experts caution about
the attachment risks and the influence of corporations behind such AI,
although users find emotional comfort and companionship in these
interactions.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FAST: EFFICIENT ROBOT ACTION TOKENIZATION (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Physical Intelligence has released the efficient action tokenizer
that it uses for the strong auto regressive policy for robotic
control. The model allows for a much better representation of states.
It uses the same technology as is used in JPEG and MP4 compression
techniques. 

 SELF-SUPERVISED TRANSFORMATION LEARNING (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 STL introduces a self-supervised approach to transformation learning
by replacing transformation labels with representations derived from
image pairs. 

 ITERATIVE DEPTH ESTIMATION (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MonSter combines monocular depth estimation and stereo matching in a
dual-branch architecture to iteratively refine depth maps. While
slightly slower, the method is as much as 49% better than the strong
baselines presented in the paper. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 COCONUT: TRAINING LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL TO REASON IN A CONTINUOUS
LATENT SPACE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Meta teased an idea in a recent paper that allowed for model
reasoning using a continuous latent space. It has released the code
for the system. 

 LLM-BASED HEURISTIC EVOLUTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MCTS-AHD employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search for LLM-based heuristic
evolution while preserving all LLM-generated heuristics in a tree
structure. 

 LIMITS OF PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A study exploring whether instruction-tuned models possess
fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are
prompted using in-context examples. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI CRASH COURSE (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI Crash Course to help busy builders catch up to the public frontier
of AI research in two weeks. 

 O3, OH MY (31 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's o3 model, announced during the company's "12 Days of
Shipmas," is a significant breakthrough in AI reasoning and
capabilities, scoring exceptionally well on benchmarks like Codeforces
and GPQA. Although it demonstrates superhuman performance in coding
and math, concerns linger about its high compute costs and safety
implications. OpenAI is actively seeking safety researchers to
contribute to testing as models like o3 push AI boundaries further. 

 APHERIS RETHINKS THE AI DATA BOTTLENECK IN LIFE SCIENCE WITH
FEDERATED COMPUTING (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Apheris, using federated computing, enables secure AI model training
without moving sensitive health data. The startup recently pivoted to
focus on data owners in pharma and life sciences, finding success with
major clients like Roche. It has raised $8.25 million to expand and
develop its product further.

PHYSICAL WORLD (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google is forming a new team under Tim Brooks at DeepMind to develop
AI models simulating the physical world, focusing on real-time
interactive generation. 

 HOW AI MIGHT REVERSE WEB DESIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI's preference for simplicity suggests a future web dominated by
text-based interfaces. 

 AI-GENERATED PHISHING EMAILS ARE GETTING VERY GOOD AT TARGETING
EXECUTIVES (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI-driven phishing scams are increasingly targeting executives using
vast amounts of scraped personal data.
