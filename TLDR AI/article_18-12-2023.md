 BUILDING A GENAL APP? TO AVOID HALLUCINATIONS, READ THIS FIRST.
(SPONSOR) [6] 

 How can you avoid incomplete, inaccurate responses in your GenAl app?
Neo4j knowledge graphs [7] offer the capabilities you need.
üöÄ Power LLMS with your company's data using retrieval augmented
generation (RAG)

‚ûï Easily add data with a dev-friendly schema (no redesign required!)

üß© Seamlessly integrate with GenAl tools like LangChain, Llamalndex,
and Ollama

Explore what's possible with a walkthrough of the GenAl Stack [8], a
new stack that Neo4j created with Docker, LangChain, and Ollama to
speed GenAl app development in a trusted environment.

You can now also build GenAl apps at scale with Neo4j and Amazon
Bedrock [9].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META RELEASES HUGE FIRST-PERSON VIDEO DATASET (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Video understanding is an old field that is just now starting to find
success. The main driver of success is quality datasets. This work
from Meta includes many sensor data sources and hand poses. It
provides baseline performance for existing methods. 

 SNAPCHAT+ SUBSCRIBERS CAN NOW CREATE AND SEND AI-GENERATED IMAGES (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Snapchat is introducing new AI-powered features for Snapchat+
subscribers, including an AI image generator that creates images from
text prompts and a Dream selfie feature that creates fantastical
images with friends. A new AI extend tool allows users to
automatically expand and fill in the background of photos. These
features are rolling out regionally to over 7 million Snapchat+
subscribers. 

 GOOGLE BRINGS GEMINI PRO TO VERTEX AI (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google has launched Gemini Pro, a lightweight version of its advanced
AI model Gemini Ultra, for public preview in Vertex AI, offering text
and image processing capabilities and customizable contexts for
various use cases.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 STABILIZING TRAINING BY PREVENTING ENTROPY COLLAPSE (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Transformers, as amazing as they are, are often hard to train, with
their many instabilities. One of the main issues is when an Attention
matrix‚Äôs entropy collapses. This work is a way to prevent that with
a simple reparametrization. 

 ESTIMATING LIGHTING IN IMAGES WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 This project introduces a novel technique for estimating lighting in
images, overcoming the limitations of current methods that rely on HDR
panorama datasets. By using diffusion models to render chrome balls
into standard images, the technique reveals a unique relationship
between chrome balls and diffusion noise. 

 LANGUAGE MODELS FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DriveMLM is a new framework that uses large language models to
enhance autonomous driving. This system, which combines language
decisions with vehicle controls, not only integrates with existing
autonomous driving systems, but also shows better performance in
simulations.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 UNSTRUCTURED: TURN HTML, PDF, PNG, AND OTHER COMPLEX FORMATS INTO
LLM-READY JSON (SPONSOR) [16] 

 LLMs work best with clean, curated data. But most of this data is
hard to find, hard to work with, and hard to clean. Unstructured [16]
extracts and transform complex data (webpages, docs, images‚Ä¶) for
use with every major vector database and LLM framework [16].
‚ÄúUnstructured has solved the most difficult part of building an LLM
application.‚Äù ‚Äî LangChain Co-founder Harrison Chase. Make your
data LLM-ready [16]

 COFRAME COFFEE (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 Coffee, launched last week, helps streamline frontend development
with AI by plugging into existing codebases. The project focuses
specifically on a first-class DX based on learnings the Coframe team
has gathered from their own experience in generating 80%+ of their
frontend with AI. 

 FRAMEWORK FOR LLM APP EVALUATION (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 DeepEval is an all-in-one evaluation framework for LLM apps that
allows users to easily identify and iterate on unsatisfactory LLM
outputs. It currently offers 14+ evaluation metrics such as
hallucination, summarization, G-Eval, RAGAS, etc., for users to
evaluate entire datasets in a Pytest-like or component-based fashion. 

 TROUBLESHOOTING PYTORCH MEMORY ISSUES (18 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 One of the biggest challenges for practitioners using Pytorch has
been figuring out why things run out of memory. Some amazing new tools
in Pytorch 2.1 give insight into memory usage. It can even be used to
classify the usage into familiar buckets (e.g., activations,
gradients).

 AMD COMMUNITY PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 MI300X is AMD‚Äôs flagship AI accelerator that, with ROCm 6, is now
close to NVIDIA performance for inference workloads. This is great
news for the community, as it opens up alternative chips for emerging
AI companies. 

 FINE TUNING MISTRAL 7B ON MAGIC THE GATHERING DRAFTS (10 MINUTE READ)
[21] 

 An experiment with fine-tuning to enhance GPT-4's capabilities using
Magic: The Gathering draft as a test case led to a fine-tuned 7B
parameter model that closely matched human-level performance. 

 THE WHERE, WHEN, AND HOW OF AI (9 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Leading founders and venture investors talk about what's happening in
AI, from the application of LLMs to enterprise innovation. If the pace
of ‚Äúthings you should know about AI‚Äù is somewhat overwhelming,
this is a good quick recap.

 MMLU PROMPT TEMPLATES (3 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Medprompt+ from Microsoft is the current best prompting method for
MMLU. Microsoft has released the template along with many other
chain-of-thought style templates that are standard across the
evaluation community. 

 PRICEGPT (WEBSITE) [24] 

 Analyze your (or a competitor‚Äôs) pricing page. 

 AGILITY IS USING LLMS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ITS HUMANOID ROBOTS (2
MINUTE READ) [25] 

 Generative AI and large language models are transforming robotics.
Agility's bipedal robot Digit can now perform complex tasks based on
natural language commands, signaling a shift towards more human-like,
intuitive robotic interactions.
