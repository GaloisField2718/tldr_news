HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META'S NEW TRAINING AND INFERENCE CHIP (22 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has announced the next generation of its AI accelerator chip.
Its development focused on chip memory (128GB at 5nm) and throughput
(11 TFLOPs at int8). 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI PRO 1.5 ENTERS PUBLIC PREVIEW (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has made its most advanced generative AI model, Gemini 1.5
Pro, available in public preview on its Vertex AI platform. It offers
a large context window of up to 1 million tokens. 

 MICROSOFT COULD UPDATE COPILOT TO DETECT UPCOMING NATURAL DISASTERS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft is collaborating with OpenAI to develop sound recognition
AI capable of detecting natural disasters by analyzing environmental
sounds. The newly patented technology processes sound signals through
a neural network, providing alerts for events like earthquakes and
home intrusions. This AI integration could enhance the capabilities of
applications like Copilot and ChatGPT, particularly for Windows users.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MEASURING LARGE MODEL PERSUASIVENESS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In a study examining persuasiveness, the Claude 3 Opus AI model was
found to closely match human persuasiveness. This was determined
through statistical tests and adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Humans were slightly more persuasive, but not by a statistically
significant margin, underscoring a trend where larger, more
sophisticated models are becoming more convincing. Claude 3 Opus
emerged as the top model in terms of persuasiveness. A control
condition confirmed the study's methodological reliability by showing
expectedly negligible persuasiveness for indisputable facts. 

 3D ASSET CREATION WITH DREAMVIEW (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DreamView introduces an innovative approach to creating 3D objects
from text descriptions that allows for detailed customization from
multiple viewpoints while ensuring the object remains consistent
overall.

 üá¨üáß¬†CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN AI, ENTERPRISE, AND WEB3 AT THE
LONDON BLOCKCHAIN CONFERENCE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 This May, the Excel London convention centre will be filled to the
brim with Web3 and AI leaDers [11] from all over the world. Save your
spot today [12] to meet the smartest people in the industry, learn
from visionary entrepreneurs, and network with 50+ investors in

‚Üí Agenda [13] | Tickets [12] (Space is limited)

 REWRITING PYTORCH NN IN TRITON (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Attorch is an attempt to rewrite portions of PyTorch‚Äôs nn module in
Python and Triton. It is designed to be an easily hackable and
performant neural network experimentation library. It is important to
note that this would have been prohibitively expensive to write only a
few years ago. 

 POLICY-GUIDED DIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Policy-guided diffusion offers a new method for training agents in
offline settings, creating synthetic trajectories that closely align
with both behavior and target policies. This technique helps to
generate more realistic training data, significantly improving the
performance of offline reinforcement learning models. 

 EVALUATING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ON LONG TEXTS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Ada-LEval is a new benchmark designed to rigorously test large
language models on their ability to understand long and ultra-long
documents. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SPEEDING UP 3D GENERATION WITH HASH3D (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hash3D introduces a novel approach to accelerate 3D generative
modeling by utilizing a hashing mechanism that leverages feature-map
redundancy across similar camera positions and diffusion time-steps. 

 AMAZON SCRAMBLES FOR ITS PLACE IN THE AI RACE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion into AI startup
Anthropic, signifying the tech giant's focus on competing with
Microsoft's OpenAI-powered services via AWS. Despite this investment,
Amazon's internal AGI team is ambitiously working to outpace Anthropic
with its own AI model, Olympus. Amazon's strategic move underscores
the importance of advanced AI in the Big Tech arena. 

 ELON MUSK'S UPDATED GROK AI CLAIMS TO BE BETTER AT CODING AND MATH (2
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Elon Musk's xAI has released Grok-1.5, an AI with enhanced math and
coding skills that boasts a significant performance increase and
competitive benchmark results against leading AI models like GPT-4.
The updated model can now process much longer context windows,
improving its memory capacity. Grok-1.5 is currently accessible to
Premium+ users of X. X plans to expand availability to regular Premium
subscribers.
