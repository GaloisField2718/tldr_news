RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ENHANCING DIFFUSION MODELS WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (18 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13301?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper investigates the use of reinforcement learning to optimize
diffusion models for downstream objectives like image quality. The
proposed approach, Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
proves effective in adapting text-to-image models to challenging
objectives and improving prompt-image alignment without additional
data or human annotation. 

ENABLING ARBITRARY-LENGTH TEXT GENERATION WITH LANGUAGE-BASED
RECURRENCE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/RecurrentGPT?utm_source=tldrai] 

This project introduces RECURRENTGPT, a language-based recurrence
mechanism incorporated into large language models like ChatGPT. By
simulating the Long Short-Term Memory mechanism, RECURRENTGPT enables
arbitrary-length text generation while preserving long-term memory. It
demonstrates potential for interactive writing systems and
personalized interactive fiction, showcasing the utility of borrowing
ideas from cognitive science and deep learning. 

GOAT: SMALL MODELS BEAT GPT4 ON ARITHMETIC (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14201?utm_source=tldrai] 

To be fair, calculators also beat GPT4 on arithmetic. The interesting
discovery here is that the llama tokenizer (which splits numbers into
individual digits) provides benefits for arithmetic even over other
similarly powerful base models fine-tuned in the same task.

TWIST: IMPROVING SPEECH LANGUAGE MODELS WITH TEXTUAL WARM-START (4
MINUTE READ)
[https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/twist/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This work introduces TWIST, a method for training Speech Language
Models (SpeechLMs) using a warm-start from pretrained textual models.
TWIST outperforms starting from scratch, with empirical analysis
emphasizing the significance of model and dataset scale. The study
presents the largest SpeechLM to date and introduces spoken versions
of a textual benchmark for improved evaluation and future research
advancements. 

GORILLA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla?utm_source=tldrai] 

Gorilla enables LLMs to use tools by invoking APIs. Given a natural
language query, Gorilla comes up with the semantically- and
syntactically- correct API to invoke.
