HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHATGPT PULSE PREVIEW (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ChatGPT Pulse is a new feature for Pro users on mobile that
proactively delivers personalized research and updates via visual
cards based on user chats, preferences, and connected apps. 

 PERPLEXITY SEARCH API (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Perplexity has released a new Search API that gives developers access
to the same large-scale infrastructure behind its public answer
engine, enabling high-quality retrieval over hundreds of billions of
web pages. 

 MUSK'S XAI SUES OPENAI, ALLEGING THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 xAI alleges OpenAI conducted a "coordinated, unfair, and unlawful
campaign" to recruit key employees and induce them to bring trade
secrets, including xAI's rapid data center deployment methods.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHAT ARE POPULAR AI CODING BENCHMARKS ACTUALLY MEASURING? (18 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Popular coding benchmarks measure something narrower than what their
names suggest. Claude scoring 80% on SWE-bench doesn't translate to it
one-shotting 80% of the tasks thrown at it. This post looks at
SWE-bench Verified, SWE-bench Pro, Aider Polyglot, LiveCodeBench, and
other benchmarks to see what they are actually measuring. Designing a
good benchmark is highly labor-intensive. Without human review and
annotations, it's nearly impossible to make a good benchmark. 

 IS OPENAI'S REINFORCEMENT FINE-TUNING (RFT) WORTH IT? (32 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for o4-mini is supposed to
be able to train models to get better at specific tasks using
reinforcement learning. It costs up to 700 times more than supervised
fine-tuning but only seems to deliver clear wins on agentic coding
tasks. The technology gives engineers flexibility in reward design
through flexible grader configurations, and the performance gains can
be substantial when it works, but it is expensive with limited
applicability, making its use difficult to justify. 

 TOWARD COMPUTATIONAL TASTE: LLMS, AESTHETICS & JUDGMENT (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 LLMs are being used to model and optimize taste in diverse fields
through personalized systems like Taste Engines, Aesthetic LLMs, and
Taste Tribes. Methods like LoRe and models like TAPO enable LLMs to
adapt to individual aesthetic preferences, potentially revolutionizing
recommendation engines and social networks. This shift towards
computational taste signifies a new era where machines not only
reflect but also shape human preferences, offering both cultural and
economic opportunities.

 Running AI on your PC is transforming productivity - but like all
emerging tech, it comes with some security risk. Learn about the
tactics attackers use to gain entry [12] to your endpoints, and how
you can stay secure. Read the eBook by Dell and Intel [12] 

 CONTINUING TO BRING YOU OUR LATEST MODELS, WITH AN IMPROVED GEMINI
2.5 FLASH AND FLASH-LITE RELEASE (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google DeepMind has released updated versions of Gemini 2.5 Flash and
2.5 Flash-Lite. The models, available on Google AI Studio and Vertex
AI, feature improvements in quality and speed compared to the current
stable models. They are also more efficient, with a 50% reduction in
output tokens for Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite and a 24% reduction for Gemini
2.5 Flash. The models are not intended to graduate to a new, stable
version, but will help shape future stable releases. 

 GEMINI ROBOTICS 1.5 BRINGS AI AGENTS INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD (15
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google DeepMind has released two models that unlock agentic
experiences with advanced thinking. Gemini Robotics 1.5 is a
vision-language-action model that turns visual information and
instructions into motor commands for a robot to perform a task. The
model thinks before taking actions and shows its process and also
learns across embodiments. Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is a vision-language
model that reasons about the physical world, natively calls digital
tools, and creates detailed multi-step plans to complete a mission.
These advances will help developers build more capable and versatile
robots that can actively understand their environments and complete
complex multi-step tasks in a general way. 

 GDPVAL: REAL-WORLD AI BENCHMARKING (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's GDPval is an evaluation benchmark that tests model
performance on real-world, economically valuable tasks across 44
occupations.

 BECOMING A RESEARCH ENGINEER AT A BIG LLM LAB - 18 MONTHS OF
STRATEGIC JOB HUNTING (41 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Max Mynter signed on as a research engineer with Mistral earlier this
week after years of working towards the outcome strategically. This
account of Mynter's personal experiences documents how he navigated
his career to get where he wanted. During the years, he would work on
getting an information advantage and then act on that information to
be prepared when it matters. He took the time to learn skills that
can't be faked and developed a network of peers and friends who sent
opportunities his way. 

 AI ISN'T REPLACING RADIOLOGISTS (21 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Improvements in image interpretation have run far ahead of their
adoption. There are hundreds of models that could potentially help
radiologists, but AI is often limited to assistive use on a small
subset of scans in any given practice. The promise of AI in radiology
is overstated by benchmarks alone. Models can lift productivity, but
their implementation depends on behavior, institutions, and
incentives. So far, radiologists have only become busier as machines
have improved.
