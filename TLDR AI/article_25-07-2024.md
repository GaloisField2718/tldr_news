 IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT FALLOUT FROM THE AT&T BREACH, NOW IS THE TIME
TO GET YOUR DATA OFF THE WEB (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's been so many mass data breaches lately, it's hard to even
keep up. Companies aren't ready for the age of AI, and hackers are
growing bolder by the day.

It's up to you to protect your identity online [4].

You can't prevent your data from ever being leaked. But with
SurfsharkOne+ [4] you can find out if your data was in a breach, and
remove it from data broker websites [4] ASAP. You'll also get
real-time notifications [4] if your credit card or ID details are
leaked.

 Mistral has released a 123B parameter model on par with the newest
Llama 3 405b model. It is released under a permissive research
license. 

 AI IS CONFUSING ‚Äî HERE'S YOUR CHEAT SHEET (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article clarifies key AI terms amidst growing confusion due to
marketing jargon, highlighting concepts such as Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), Generative AI, and machine learning. It addresses
AI challenges like bias and hallucinations and elaborates on how AI
models are trained, referencing various models, algorithms, and
architecture, including transformers and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG). The piece also mentions leading AI companies and
their products, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, and hardware used for AI,
like NVIDIA's H100 chip. 

 OPENAI'S LATEST MODEL WILL BLOCK THE ‚ÄòIGNORE ALL PREVIOUS
INSTRUCTIONS' LOOPHOLE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has developed a new technique called "instruction hierarchy"
for its GPT-4o Mini model to prevent users from tricking the AI with
unauthorized prompts, giving precedence to the developer's original
instructions. This safety method is a step toward building more
autonomous digital agents, ensuring they can't be manipulated into
performing unintended actions. The enhanced prioritization of system
instructions over user prompts aims to address growing safety and
trust concerns surrounding AI models.

 KAN OR MLP: A FAIR COMPARISON (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Under the same number of parameters or FLOPs, they find KAN
outperforms MLP only in symbolic formula representation, but remains
inferior to MLP on other tasks of machine learning, computer vision,
NLP, and audio processing. 

 STABLE VIDEO 4D (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stable Video 4D transforms a single object video into multiple
novel-view videos of eight different angles/views. Stable Video 4D,
with a single inference, generates 5 frames across 8 views in about 40
seconds. Users can specify camera angles, tailoring the output to meet
specific creative needs. 

 PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION MODELING (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeepRank-GNN-esm is a graph-based deep learning tool designed to rank
and identify accurate protein-protein interaction models. The tool
utilizes protein language models to streamline the selection of
near-native PPI conformations, aiding in drug design and disease
research.

 THE AI DANGERS OF A SECOND TRUMP PRESIDENCY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Republican platform, influenced by Trump, vows to repeal Biden's
executive order on responsible AI development. This contrasts with the
current administration's comprehensive approach aimed at safeguarding
workers, fostering innovation, and protecting civil rights against
AI's potential harms. Critics argue that Trump's stance could empower
Big Tech at the expense of individual rights and societal protections.


 SMALL TEAMS, BIG IMPACT: HOW AI IS RESHUFFLING THE FUTURE OF WORK?
(15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI is reshaping the future of work, leading to smaller, more
efficient teams and an increase in entrepreneurship thanks to AI
capabilities being more accessible. While companies are prioritizing
hiring for AI skills, there's a need for an honest discussion about
AI's impact on job replacement and the creation of new roles. Adoption
hiccups persist with AI technologies requiring significant
"handholding" due to immature data or systems.
