HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

FINE-TUNED LLAMA CODE MODEL BEATS GPT-4 ON CODE BENCHMARK (1 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.phind.com/blog/code-llama-beats-gpt4?utm_source=tldrai] 

Companies with stores of high quality internal data have released
fine-tuned versions of Llama that are extremely adept at code just
days after Meta released its new programming language models. It is
important to note that the current version of GPT-4 is still better
than any open-source model at coding. This article compares the new
Llama models with the March version of GPT-4. 

PHOTOREALISTIC UNREAL GRAPHICS (PUG) FROM META (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://pug.metademolab.com/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Meta AI has unveiled a series of datasets that harness the power of
Unreal Engine for photorealistic imagery. The released datasets
include PUG: Animals for foundation model research, PUG: ImageNet to
assess image classifier robustness, and PUG: SPAR for vision-language
model evaluation. 

AI BOTS ARE SO GOOD AT MIMICKING THE HUMAN BRAIN AND VISION THAT
CAPTCHAS ARE USELESS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://qz.com/ai-bots-recaptcha-turing-test-websites-authenticity-1850734350?utm_source=tldrai]


Recent research revealed that AI bots decode CAPTCHAs faster and more
accurately than humans. The study challenges the effectiveness of
CAPTCHAs in the age of advancing AI.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

FINERECON: DEPTH-AWARE FEED-FORWARD NETWORK FOR DETAILED 3D
RECONSTRUCTION (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01480?utm_source=tldrai] 

New research from Apple shows amazing performance on the challenging
problem of 3D object reconstruction. 

A DYNAMIC NETWORK FOR SHARPER IMAGE FUSION (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12538v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

Scientists have designed a new system called MGDN that merges multiple
images into one clear picture, fixing the issues older methods had in
using varying images. The special tools inside MGDN help in
understanding the different parts of images better and blending them
smoothly. 

A BETTER TEST FOR DETECTING BIAS IN LLMS (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12539v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have developed a new test called CALM to check if AI
language tools are biased. After collecting a lot of data from
different sources and testing various AI models, they found that some
big AI models can be more biased than smaller ones.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

TRAIN LONG CONTEXT MODELS WITH DEEP SPEED (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/tree/master/blogs/deepspeed-ulysses?utm_source=tldrai]


DeepSpeed is a library from Microsoft that can be used to scale up
language models pre-training. It is somewhat complicated to use, but
it provides powerful abstractions. Microsoft recently added sequence
parallelism to train models with longer context lengths. It isn't a
novel breakthrough, but rather an engineering win for the open-source
community. 

APPLE'S ULTRA FAST VIT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/apple/ml-fastvit?utm_source=tldrai] 

Running at less than 1 ms latency, this super fast vision transformer
from Apple is a case study in edge deployment. 

ENHANCING DETECTING OF HUMAN-OBJECT INTERACTIONS (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06202v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

While the DETR framework is popular for human-object interaction (HOI)
research, current two-stage transformers overlook critical contextual
details, like pose and orientation, leading to issues in identifying
complex interactions. Enhanced predicate visual context (PViC)
improves HOI recognition by better integrating image features and
spatial information.

ANOTHER EVEN BETTER OPEN-SOURCE CODE MODEL (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-34B-V1.0?utm_source=tldrai]


The WizardLM folks have used their Evol instruct technique to
dramatically improve Llama code performance - they even beat the Phind
model. These results are slightly suspect because they generate
instructions that directly improve their evaluation scores, instead of
using a fixed dataset and also treating evaluation as fixed. This may
not be an issue, but it breaks machine learning best practices and so
it's hard to know what the full general capabilities are. 

CODE MODELS LOSE LANGUAGE SKILLS, BUT WE CAN FIX IT (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur?utm_source=tldrai] 

The reason closed source models like Claude or GPT-4 are so impressive
is because they are incredibly good at reasoning AND have general
purpose language ability. Many open alternatives focus on an extremely
narrow niche of skills and neglect others. The OpenLemur project aims
to balance language model skills across many different tasks similar
to closed models. 

AN INTERVIEW WITH MARC ANDREESSEN ABOUT AI AND HOW YOU CHANGE THE
WORLD (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-marc-andreessen-about-ai-and-how-you-change-the-world/?utm_source=tldrai]


AI will create major economic benefits and improvements in human life,
countering "hysterical freakout" about existential threats. The risks
of general AI taking over are overblown since it lacks evolutionary
drives. We should take an engineering approach of incremental
progress.
