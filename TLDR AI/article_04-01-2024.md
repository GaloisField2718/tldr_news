HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SIKON, SONY, AND CANON FIGHT AI FAKES WITH NEW CAMERA TECH (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Nikon, Sony Group, and Canon are developing camera technology to
embed digital signatures in images, allowing differentiation from
AI-generated fakes. Nikon's mirrorless cameras will include
tamper-resistant digital signatures for professionals, providing
details like date, time, and location. Sony plans to add an online
tool called Verify to its mirrorless SLR cameras in spring 2024 to
check images for digital signatures, highlighting any AI or tampered
content. Canon will introduce similar technology for images and videos
by 2024. These advancements address the growing challenge of
distinguishing real images from sophisticated AI-generated fakes. 

 INTEL TO SPIN OUT AI SOFTWARE FIRM WITH OUTSIDE INVESTMENT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Intel is forming a new independent company called Articul8 AI focused
on artificial intelligence software, with investment from
DigitalBridge Group and other investors. Articul8, stemming from
Intel's work with Boston Consulting Group, will have an independent
board and will not be publicly traded, will focus on creating
cost-effective, secure AI solutions for business use.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SELF-PLAY FINE-TUNING CONVERTS WEAK LANGUAGE MODELS TO STRONG
LANGUAGE MODELS (33 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 One of the big drawbacks of current language models is that you need
extremely expensive human preference data to make them work well. A
big research direction recently has been figuring out if we can have
the language models perform self-play to improve without collecting
this data. SPIN is a new method that takes a step in that direction
with just SFT data - it can dramatically improve a base model‚Äôs
performance across various tasks. 

 LEARNING TO FIND BOUNDARIES WITH BOUNDARY ATTENTION (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Finding contours and boundaries in images is a classic computer
vision problem. However, when introducing noise, quality shifts, or
out-of-distribution examples, many existing methods fail to perform
well. This new learned method performs extremely well on sensor
readings and is only 207k parameters. It uses a two-stage training
process and greatly improves state of the art. 

 ENHANCING LOW-LIGHT PHOTOS WITH SELF-SUPERVISED ADAPTATION (16 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This research leverages bracketing photography and a novel temporally
modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) to significantly improve photo
quality in low-light conditions. By training with synthetic data and
adapting to real-world images, this approach outperforms existing
multi-image processing methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 GPT-FAST MIXTRAL SUPPORT (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 GPT-fast is a great push from the Pytorch team to speed up vanilla
models. It can achieve an impressive 218 tokens per second across 8
GPUs. 

 TINYGPT-V (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Efficient multimodal large language model with a small backbone. 

 GENERATING VR SIDE-BY-SIDE VIDEOS WITH MARIGOLD (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 By using state-of-the-art depth estimation and some classical video
processing, you can now turn monocular videos into 3D viewable XR
experiences! The code is MIT-licensed and available for commercial
use.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TEXT-TO-AUDIO GENERATION WITH T2I MODEL ADAPTATION (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 The Auffusion system, inspired by Text-to-Image diffusion models,
offers a breakthrough in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation. It excels in
creating high-quality audio from text, especially for complex inputs. 

 THE NYT VS OPENAI IS NOT JUST A LEGAL BATTLE (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI highlights a deep-seated
conflict between the advancement of technology and copyright
infringement. While some argue for unrestricted AI progress as a boon
to humanity, others stress the moral imperative to respect creators'
rights and advocate for a balanced approach that values both
technological advancement and the protection of intellectual property.
This dispute underscores the complex relationship between morality and
progress in the AI era. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT AI AND EDUCATION IN 2023 (17 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Education is adapting to the integration of AI by exploring
collaborative approaches to AI-assisted tutoring, writing instruction,
and assessment.
