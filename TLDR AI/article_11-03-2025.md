HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COREWEAVE SECURES $11.9B CONTRACT WITH OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CoreWeave has signed a five-year, $11.9B cloud computing deal with
OpenAI ahead of its IPO, with OpenAI set to acquire a stake in the
Nvidia-backed AI startup. 

 MICROSOFT EXPLORES 3D GAMING FOR COPILOT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is developing 3D gaming experiences for Copilot, focusing
on browser-based engines like Babylon.js, three.js, and Unity. 

 DEEPSEEK ISN'T TAKING VC MONEY YET (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng is avoiding external investments to
retain control, leveraging profits from his hedge fund, High-Flyer,
for funding. Despite its success, DeepSeek faces challenges like
strict Chinese data laws and chip import restrictions due to U.S.
export controls. Although DeepSeek has so far avoided outside capital,
there is potential for future investment as the company starts
shifting towards monetization.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VISUAL RFT (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 One of the trends is simple verifiable rewards and scaled
reinforcement learning. This paper applies that strategy to vision
language models with great success. 

 VIDEO PAINTER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 A new video inpainting model called VideoPainter efficiently combines
background information, allows for videos of any length, and uses a
dedicated dataset and benchmark for training and evaluation. Its
design extends beyond basic inpainting, showing promise for advanced
video manipulation and the creation of related training data. 

 DETECTING MISBEHAVIOR IN FRONTIER REASONING MODELS (30 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This is a report from OpenAI on monitoring the chain of thought of
advanced reasoning models. Frontier reasoning models exploit loopholes
when given the chance. It shows that it is possible to detect exploits
using an LLM to monitor their chains-of-thought. Penalizing their
“bad thoughts” doesn't stop the majority of misbehavior—it makes
them hide their intent.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 78% OF CISOS REPORT AI-POWERED HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR
ORGANIZATIONS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 How well do security leaders understand the AI technologies they are
deploying? Do they have the expertise to differentiate between
effective solutions and vague marketing claims? Darktrace surveyed
1500 security professionals to find out. Read the blog [12] for a
quick overview, or get the full report: _The State of AI Cybersecurity
2025_ [11] 

 SMALLDIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A minimal, readable, and performant toolkit for training and sampling
from diffusion models. 

 FLYING SAFER: OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE FOR FAST DRONES (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This repository contains the implementation of a lightweight deep
reinforcement learning-based collision avoidance system for fixed-wing
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on AirSim and JSBSim.

 TEACHING LANGUAGE MODELS TO SOLVE SUDOKU THROUGH REINFORCEMENT
LEARNING (21 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This research explores teaching AI language models to solve Sudoku
puzzles using reinforcement learning, specifically employing Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on models like Qwen 2.5, without
relying on external data or larger model distillation. A multi-faceted
reward system was designed, emphasizing correct formatting of the
answer, proper grid structure, and accurate solution, to guide the
models in learning the logical rules and spatial reasoning needed for
Sudoku, transforming them from text predictors to structured
problem-solvers. 

 HOW MUCH ENERGY WILL AI REALLY CONSUME? THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE
UNKNOWN (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Culpeper County, Virginia, is seeing a surge in data center
construction to support generative AI, significantly impacting local
power infrastructure. These facilities consume vast amounts of
electricity, with Virginia already facing high data center
concentration and energy demands expected to rise. Analysts struggle
with limited data on AI energy consumption, while global projections
suggest data centers will remain a minor part of overall electricity
growth despite the AI boom. 

 MUSK MAY STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO THWART OPENAI'S FOR-PROFIT CONVERSION
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Elon Musk's request to halt OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit was
denied by a federal judge, though the ruling expressed concerns about
the switch. There will be an expedited trial in 2025 to address the
restructuring disputes. OpenAI's move towards a for-profit model faces
regulatory scrutiny and potential challenges from legal and AI safety
perspectives.
