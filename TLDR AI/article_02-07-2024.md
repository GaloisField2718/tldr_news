 AI IS MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SPAMMERS, HACKERS, AND FRAUDSTERS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Research by Incogni [4] reveals that imposter calls (impersonating a
person, agency, or company) were a major problem in 2023.

AI makes it easier for bad actors to aggregate user information for
robocalls, imposter calls, and other types of fraud [4]. Deep fake
technology is bound to make this worse.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT'S MUSTAFA SULEYMAN SAYS HE LOVES SAM ALTMAN, BELIEVES HE'S
SINCERE ABOUT AI SAFETY (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, praised OpenAI's CEO Sam
Altman and discussed the collaborative yet independent relationship
between Microsoft and OpenAI in a recent interview at the Aspen Ideas
Festival. Suleyman emphasized the need for a dialogue around AI safety
and regulation rather than perceiving the development of AI as a race.
He also expressed interest in AI cooperation with China and the
potential role of AI as a teaching aid in classrooms. 

 WHEN THE TERMS OF SERVICE CHANGE TO MAKE WAY FOR A.I. TRAINING (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tech companies like Google and Meta are updating their privacy
policies to use public and possibly private user data to train AI
systems as they navigate a complex landscape of privacy laws and user
consent. Backlashes have occurred as users and creators are fearful
about the use of their content in training AI that could potentially
replace them. The tensions highlight emerging challenges in AI
development, data privacy rights, and the balance between innovation
and ethics in the tech industry. 

 MEET FIGMA AI (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Figma AI is a new suite of AI-powered tools for Figma that helps
designers with tasks such as visual search, asset search, text
editing, image editing, prototyping, layer renaming, and design
generation. These features are powered by third-party AI models and
are free to use during the beta period.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SYNTHETIC DATA CREATION WITH 1 BILLION PERSONAS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This work treats web text as coming from a persona and then can
condition on that persona to dramatically improve downstream task
performance. The researchers find a jump of 20% points on MATH. 

 DEEPDIVE: SCALING UP WITH MUP (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A really great and surprisingly accessible post about tuning
hyperparameters as you scale up model and dataset size. 

 WEBPAGE CODE GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new process to improve Web2Code
instruction tuning. It involves creating new webpage image-code pairs,
refining existing webpage code generation data, creating new text
question-answer pairs, and refining existing webpage understanding
data.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WHAT CAN CURATED PRONUNCIATION DATA DO FOR TEXT-TO-SPEECH MODELS?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Text-to-speech has improved by leaps and bounds in recent years. Can
language data take it even further? Join experts from Oxford Languages
[12] and WellSaid Labs for a live discussion [13] of what's next ‚Äî
AI voice generation, pronunciation data, text-to-speech linguistics
challenges and more. Register (free) to submit questions to the
panelists! [13] 

 BLOCK TRANSFORMER FOR IMPROVED INFERENCE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This repository introduces a new type of Transformer with a
dramatically reduced KV cache size. It hasn't been proven at scale,
but it can - in theory - match regular Transformer performance. 

 COMPOSIO (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Composio equips agents with well-crafted tools, empowering them to
tackle complex tasks. 

 UNSUPERVISED SAM FOR AUTOMATIC IMAGE SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Unsupervised SAM (UnSAM) is a new model for whole-image segmentation
that eliminates the need for human annotations. Using a
divide-and-conquer approach, UnSAM identifies hierarchical structures
in visual scenes by combining top-down and bottom-up clustering
methods.

 AI SCALING MYTHS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The future potential of LLMs reaching AGI through scaling alone is
unlikely. While scaling has shown improvements in model capabilities,
it primarily enhances perplexity rather than emergent abilities.
Acquiring high-quality training data is becoming increasingly
challenging. 

 ANOMALY DETECTION WITH SCENE-SPECIFIC FOCUS (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers have introduced a new anomaly detection problem that
targets 'odd-looking' objects relative to others in a scene. Unlike
traditional methods, anomalies here are scene-specific and identified
through multiple viewpoints. 

 A DISCUSSION OF DISCUSSIONS ON AI BIAS (29 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Discussion on the nature of AI bias has intensified, with critics
arguing that the way models like Playground AI sometimes alter a
user's ethnicity in images demonstrates biases in ML. However, some
users deny this is a bug or relevant bias, citing examples where Asian
features are overrepresented. The debate extends to broader
implications of AI bias across industries. It is a complex issue with
no simple resolution.

QUICK LINKS

 FOLLOWING LENGTH CONSTRAINTS IN INSTRUCTIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Most models don't follow requests for length (e.g., fewer than 40
words). This work shows how you can tune them to do so. 

 THE SHAPE OF INFORMATION (4 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This article explains how to maximize limited resources using binary
logic.
