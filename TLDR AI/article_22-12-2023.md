HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 RITE AID BANNED FROM USING FACIAL RECOGNITION (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rite Aid used facial recognition software that falsely identified
shoplifters, leading to dramatic confrontations. The FTC is cracking
down more on this technology. 

 ANTHROPIC REPORTEDLY IN TALKS TO RAISE $750M AT A $15B VALUATION (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is reportedly seeking to raise $750M at a valuation of $15B
in a round led by Menlo Ventures. 

 APPLE‚ÄôS LATEST AI RESEARCH COULD COMPLETELY TRANSFORM YOUR IPHONE
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple has released two papers introducing new techniques for 3D
avatars and efficient language model inference, which could allow AI
systems to run on iPhones and iPads.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ULTRAFAST 3D RECONSTRUCTION FROM A SINGLE IMAGE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gaussian Splatting has pushed 3D reconstruction forward. However, it
often requires 200+ images of an object for accurate reconstruction.
This work moves to a single monocular image and a learning-based
technique that maps each pixel of the image into a 3d gaussian. The
cool novel piece here is the introduction of the ‚ÄúSplatter Image,‚Äù
which encodes 3D information for downstream rendering. 

 POWERINFER FOR LLMS ON CONSUMER GPUS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper explores the idea that models have hot neurons used for
almost all inputs and cold neurons that are used much less often. By
preloading the hot neurons to the GPU, you can save memory without
sacrificing much throughput. A companion code library is available. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH SEQUENCE-AWARE LOSS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a 'sequence-aware' loss function to
improve Denoising Probabilistic Models (DPMs), addressing the issue of
timestep correlation in image generation. This new approach not only
offers a tighter estimation of loss but also shows significant
improvements in image quality on datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA, as
evidenced by better FID and Inception Scores.
