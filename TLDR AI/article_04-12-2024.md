HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELEVEN LABS CONVERSATIONAL AI (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Eleven Labs has launched a new conversational AI service that is more
of an end-to-end product for building conversational agents. It uses a
variety of LLMs on the backend while integrating seamlessly to a wide
variety of specialized voices. 

 CLAUDE MODELS NOW FASTER AND SMARTER ON AWS TRAINIUM2 (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Claude models are being optimized for AWS' advanced Trainium2 AI
chips. This will enable faster and more efficient performance. Claude
3.5 Haiku is now available on AWS Trainium2 and model distillation in
Amazon Bedrock. 

 AMAZON LAUNCHES NOVA (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon Nova introduces a suite of multimodal models designed for
tasks like document analysis, visual understanding, and creative
content generation. With a focus on customization and efficiency, Nova
models cater to diverse enterprise needs while excelling in tasks that
combine text, image, and video inputs.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DIFFUSION MEETS FLOW MATCHING: TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN (21 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This post talks through some of the literature and shows that,
mathematically, both flow matching and diffusion models are the same.
Interestingly, flow matching still seems to scale better practically. 

 RESTRUCTURING VECTOR QUANTIZATION WITH THE ROTATION TRICK (18 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Vector Quantization relies on gradient estimation through what's
known as the Straight Through Gradient estimator. However, its
direction is sometimes incorrect. This paper suggests rotation as a
way to fix the gradients and improve code book utilization. 

 LAYOUT GENERATION WITH DIFFUSION GANS (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DogLayout is a hybrid model that combines GANs and diffusion
processes to overcome challenges in layout generation.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TAKE THE STATE OF AI DEVELOPMENT SURVEY FOR A CHANCE TO WIN A NEW
MACBOOK M4 (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Ever wonder how other companies are developing, shipping, and
monitoring AI? Vellum is running the ultimate AI-in-production survey
[13], and they're looking for insider knowledge from folks like you.
It takes 4 minutes and you'll get early access to the report once it
drops PLUS a chance to win a MacBook M4. No brainer! [13] 

 HUNYUAN VIDEO MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This state-of-the-art open video model from Tencent is particularly
compelling due to its realistic motion and dual training as an image
generation model. This dual training means the aesthetics of the
output are higher quality, akin to image generation models like Flux. 

 SCENE TEXT RECOGNITION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 TextSSR is a framework that uses diffusion-based methods to generate
accurate and realistic synthetic text images for scene text
recognition. 

 VIDEO UNDERSTANDING WITH MULTIMODAL LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[16] 

 T2Vid is a new method to enhance video understanding in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). It generates video-like samples to
diversify training instructions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A SYSTEM OF AGENTS BRINGS SERVICE-AS-SOFTWARE TO LIFE (13 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 AI is transitioning software from a tool to autonomous agents capable
of executing tasks traditionally performed by humans, with a projected
$4.6 trillion market opportunity. Innovations such as LLMs and agents
enable AI systems to process unstructured data, make decisions, and
act autonomously across sectors like sales and healthcare. The future
of AI involves Systems of Agents that collaborate and learn from each
other, functioning like a highly skilled team to deliver services. 

 AI MUSIC IS MORE REALISTIC THAN EVER: MEET SUNO'S NEW MODEL (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Suno has become the fifth most-used generative AI service with its
realistic AI music model V4, despite facing a copyright lawsuit. The
model improves user experience by focusing on human preferences,
offering enhanced sound quality and advanced composition skills. Suno
aims to advance AI-human music collaboration while addressing
copyright concerns with the recording industry. 

 BLUESKY'S OPEN API MEANS ANYONE CAN SCRAPE YOUR DATA FOR AI TRAINING
(2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Bluesky isn't using user content to train AI, but third parties like
Hugging Face have accessed posts for machine learning research. This
highlights the public nature of user posts and the challenges in
controlling third-party use. Bluesky is exploring ways for users to
convey consent, but enforcement outside its platform remains a
challenge.
