 DEEPMIND‚ÄôS NEW MATH MODEL GETS IMO GOLD WITHOUT ANY HUMAN
DEMONSTRATION DATA (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AlphaGeometry solved 25 Olympiad problems in the allotted time limit,
improving on the previous state-of-the-art, which solved 10.
Importantly, it was trained on 100 million synthetic problems, which
eliminates an existing data bottleneck. DeepMind has open-sourced the
code and weights. 

 OPENAI MUST DEFEND CHATGPT FABRICATIONS AFTER FAILING TO DEFEAT LIBEL
SUIT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Georgia judge recently ruled against OpenAI's motion to dismiss a
defamation lawsuit filed by radio host Mark Walters, who alleges that
ChatGPT's ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù produced false and potentially
career-damaging claims about him. This ruling allows for the
exploration and decision on the merits of the case, challenging
OpenAI's liability for ChatGPT's outputs and raising questions about
the responsibility for AI-generated content.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BETTER PROMPTING AND FASTER INFERENCE WITH SGLANG AND RADIX ATTENTION
(12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 LMSYS has released two new innovations for language model inference.
The first is a backend change which improves overall tokens per second
performance. The second is an embedded domain-specific language for
complex prompting techniques which allows for prompting parallelism. 

 VISION FOUNDATION MODELS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (38 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This paper explores the challenge of developing Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) specifically for autonomous driving. By analyzing over
250 research papers, it provides insights into data preparation,
pre-training, and task adaptation in AI, highlighting cutting-edge
techniques like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting. 

 ENHANCING VIDEO UNDERSTANDING (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DoraemonGPT, a new AI system based on large language models, takes a
step forward in understanding dynamic real-world scenarios by focusing
on video tasks. It converts videos into a symbolic memory for
efficient spatial-temporal querying and incorporates specialized tools
and a novel planner for complex task-solving.

 DETECTING HALLUCINATIONS IN LLMS: METHODOLOGIES, CHALLENGES, AND
ADVANCEMENTS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Kolena's latest research [13] on hallucination detection for Large
Language Models (LLMs) has wide-ranging implications for evaluating
model performance. Get hands-on perspectives [13] on LLM testing from
Kolena‚Äôs ML engineers, and see how different models compare in the
wild. Register now for next week‚Äôs webinar [13] 

 AUTOMATIC BLOG TO PODCAST TO YOUTUBE PIPELINE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Nathan Lambert recently released Interconnect Tools, which allows you
to automate his multimodal blogging pipeline using text-to-speech,
image synthesis, and his entire workflow. It allows creators to focus
on writing while the tools format things into easily consumable media
for their audience. 

 ENHANCING LANGUAGE MODELS FOR TRANSLATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project proposes Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to
improve the performance of moderate-sized language models in machine
translation. This approach, applied to the 13B parameter ALMA model,
addresses the limitations of supervised fine-tuning and results in
improvements. 

 ALPHACODIUM: AI-DRIVEN CODE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 AlphaCodium introduces a novel approach to enhance code generation by
LLMs. This multi-stage, test-based iterative process significantly
improves the accuracy of models like GPT-4 in solving complex
programming problems, as demonstrated on the CodeContests dataset.

 EVALUATIONS ARE ALL WE NEED (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article explores the challenges of evaluating LLMs, comparing
them to human employee assessments. It discusses the difficulty in
measuring the intelligence and practicality of LLMs, highlighting the
limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for more
effective approaches. 

 DETECTING URBAN VILLAGES FROM SPACE (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 This study introduces UV-SAM, an adaptation of the vision foundation
model and the Segment Anything Model that can accurately identify the
boundaries of urban villages using satellite images. Offering an
efficient alternative to traditional field surveys, UV-SAM combines
different image representations for precise detection. 

 THE ROAD TO HONEST AI (12 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Recent studies suggest methods to control AI honesty, such as
identifying and manipulating honesty-related vectors within the AI or
using unrelated questions to detect lying tendencies based on the AI's
response consistency.
