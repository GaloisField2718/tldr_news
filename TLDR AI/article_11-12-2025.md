 TECHNICAL WHITEPAPER: EXTENDING NETFLIX CONDUCTOR TO ENTERPRISE SCALE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 As services multiply, retries, cron jobs, and glue code can make
orchestration brittle and hard to operate. Netflix Conductor was
designed to solve this, but it's tricky to run at enterprise scale and
security.

This whitepaper explains how the creators of Netflix Conductor built
Orkes Conductor [4] -- the control tower for microservices that adds
enterprise capabilities to the proven workflow engine. Read it for a
deep dive into Orkes, including:

 	* Delivering durable event driven workflows with clear SLAs, and
automatic recovery.
 	* Scaling to millions of tasks per second [4] with up to 99.99%
uptime
 	* Enabling agentic orchestration that pulls humans in at the right
moment

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INSIDE META'S PIVOT FROM OPEN SOURCE TO MONEY-MAKING AI MODEL (10
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta is developing a closed model codenamed Avocado, expected next
spring, after years of loudly supporting open-source. The new model is
trained on the outputs (or “distilled”) from rival models,
including Google's Gemma, OpenAI's gpt-oss, and Alibaba's Qwen. New
Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang is reportedly chafing under
Zuckerberg's “micromanagement”. Long-time AI head Yann LeCun left
last month after being sidelined under the new org structure. 

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND WILL OPEN A ROBOTIC AI LAB IN THE UK TO DISCOVER NEW
MATERIALS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google DeepMind will open a research lab for discovering new
materials in the UK as part of Alphabet's newly announced partnership
with the British government. The agreement involves Alphabet tailoring
several of its AI models for scientists, teachers, and public
employees in the UK. The new lab will research materials that could
improve medical imaging, solar panels, and chips. Using AI to unearth
novel materials could drastically reduce costs and time. 

 SHOPIFY MERCHANTS CAN NOW SELL PRODUCTS THROUGH AI CHATBOTS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Shopify merchants' products can now be discovered on AI platforms
like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot. Agentic storefronts
allow merchants to sell their products across popular API chatbots.
Agents can answer customers' questions while giving merchants insight
into search trends and topics customers are asking about. Shopify
plans to make every Shopify store agent-ready by default.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 I REVERSE ENGINEERED CHATGPT'S MEMORY SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 No vector databases, no RAG over conversation history. The system
uses four layers: ephemeral session metadata (device, location, and
usage patterns), long-term facts stored via a dedicated tool,
lightweight summaries of recent messages, and a sliding window of the
current conversation. OpenAI prioritizes speed and token efficiency
over detailed historical context. 

 IS IT A BUBBLE? (58 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 No one can definitively say whether we are currently in a bubble or
not. No one should go all-in without acknowledging that they face the
risk of ruin if things go badly. At the same time, no one should stay
all-out and risk missing out on one of the great technological steps
forward. A moderate position seems like the best approach. Intelligent
investment requires sober, insightful judgment and skillful
implementation.

 SHOPIFY OPEN-SOURCES TANGLE: AN ML PIPELINE PLATFORM WITH A POWERFUL
DRAG-AND-DROP EDITOR (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Tangle [11] is a visual experimentation platform that lets you build
ML pipelines using drag-and-drop, without writing orchestration code.
Intelligent content-based caching means unchanged steps never
recompute, and cached results are shared across your whole team. Works
with any language and framework, including Python, R, Go, Java, or
Shell. Try Tangle (open source) [11] 

 CURSOR DEBUG MODE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cursor has introduced Debug Mode, a new agent loop that incorporates
runtime logs and human interaction to fix stubborn bugs. Inspired by
expert debugging workflows, the mode generates multiple failure
hypotheses, instruments code with logs, and loops in the user to
reproduce errors and verify fixes. 

 VECTORIZED MAXSCORE OVER WAND: BUILDING FASTER TEXT SEARCH FOR HUMANS
AND AGENTS (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Designing fast search engines is a subtle optimization problem. It
takes effort to select the right algorithm and then tune it to get the
best out of the CPU. Agents write longer queries than humans, so it is
becoming increasingly important for text search to scale well with the
number of terms. For text search, this means the cursor has shifted
more and more from WAND to MAXSCORE. 

 UPGRADES TO CLAUDE CODE CLI (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Claude Code CLI now has async subagents, instant compact, customer
session names, and usage stats. There are also new keyboard shortcuts
on the /resume screen. Run 'claude update' to get all of the new
features. 

 TOWARDS A SCIENCE OF SCALING AGENT SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Agents are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI
applications. However, practitioners still rely on heuristics rather
than principled design choices. This study attempts to derive
quantitative scaling principles for agent systems.

 GETTING A GEMINI API KEY IS AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION (11 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Gemini is aimed at large organizations, not individual developers. It
is designed for maximum compliance with government regulations, not
for efficiency or productivity. Google doesn't want your business
unless you're an organization that employs tens of thousands of
people. OpenAI and Anthropic are much smaller and more nimble. They
are able to make the process of setting up a developer account quick
and easy. 

 AI WORLD MODELS RESHAPE INTERACTIVE STORYTELLING (3 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Advances in AI world models like Marble and Genie 3 generate
explorable 3D environments from text, enabling creators to build
interactive worlds and game mechanics with natural language. These
systems open the door to generative multiverses where players act as
co-creators and participate in emerging digital economies built on
interoperable assets. The shift promises new storytelling formats and
valuable training grounds for agents and robotics. 

 NVIDIA-BACKED STARCLOUD TRAINS FIRST AI MODEL IN SPACE AS ORBITAL
DATA CENTER RACE HEATS UP (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Nvidia-backed Starcloud successfully trained the first AI model in
space, using an Nvidia H100 GPU to run Google's Gemma LLM on their
Starcloud-1 satellite. These orbital data centers promise significant
energy savings compared to Earth-based facilities, addressing the
growing power demands and environmental impact of terrestrial data
centers. Starcloud plans a 5-gigawatt orbital data center to capture
constant solar energy, with implications for both commercial AI
workloads and real-time data analysis for military and emergency
response operations.
