an internal breakthrough that combined search and RL. This post
outlines one theory explaining what might actually be happening with
this new method. 

 INSIDE OPENAI, A RIFT BETWEEN BILLIONAIRES AND ALTRUISTIC RESEARCHERS
UNRAVELED OVER THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (10 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 An all-encompassing recap of the OpenAI fiasco. This will be studied
for generations. If you haven‚Äôt followed the entire saga, this
summary is a must read including all of the interesting angles and

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ZIPLORA (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 LoRAs are low rank learned matrices that change model behavior but
are cheaper than regular fine-tuning. This work proposes an effective
way to merge LoRAs together while maintaining the novel information
from each. 

 IMPROVING MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The introduction of SegVol, a universal model for medical image
segmentation, marks a new era in clinical analysis. Trained on a
comprehensive collection of CT scans, SegVol excels in segmenting an
extensive variety of anatomical categories. 

 VISUAL IN-CONTEXT PROMPTING: A NEW ERA IN AI VISION TASKS (16 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This innovative approach accommodates a range of prompts and
contexts, greatly boosting performance in segmentation tasks and
showcasing impressive results in open-set challenges.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DUCK TRACK FOR DIGITAL DATA COLLECTION (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Collecting image, audio, and keystroke data from your computer is
actually somewhat challenging. This library makes that process easy
with the purpose of training digital Agents. 

 REFERENCE DPO IMPLEMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Direct preference optimization is a stable alternative to RLHF using
very similar data. This repository contains an implementation for
study to learn about the technique. 

 KANDINSKY VIDEO'S TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kandinsky Video involves a dual-stage text-to-video process. It
crafts keyframes to outline the video's story and then smoothens
transitions and movements, substantially enhancing video quality and
reducing computational demands.

 WHAT IS OPENAI REALLY? (30 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 It‚Äôs been five incredibly turbulent days at OpenAI, with the exit
and then return of CEO Sam Altman. This article succinctly unpacks all
of that dynamism and then goes on to explore whether OpenAI is the
not-for-profit it declared itself to be in 2015 or something else
entirely. 

 LLM PREDICTS CHARACTERISTICS OF COVID VARIANTS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 GenSLMs, an AI model for genomic data, accurately generated gene
sequences resembling recent COVID-19 variants despite being trained
only on early pandemic data, showcasing its potential for predicting
virus evolution and aiding research. 

 WHY I JUST RESIGNED FROM MY JOB IN GENERATIVE AI (3 MINUTE READ) [16]


 A leader from the Audio team at Stability AI resigned due to
disagreements over the company's stance on using copyrighted works for
training generative AI models. The individual, supportive of
generative AI, believes that using copyrighted content without
permission to train models, potentially competing with original works,
cannot be considered fair use.
