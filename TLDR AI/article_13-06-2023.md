WordPress has released a new AI writing tool called Jetpack AI. The
tool can be used to generate blog posts, social media posts, and other
types of content. Jetpack AI is powered by GPT-3, a large language
model developed by OpenAI. The tool is still in beta, but it has the
potential to make it easier for people to create content for their
websites.

CAN FOUNDATION MODELS LABEL DATA LIKE HUMANS? (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/llm-leaderboard?utm_source=tldrai]

The recent hype in language models has led to statements like "our
model is preferred to ChatGPT N% of the time". This statement usually
hides the fact that GPT4 was the model doing the preferring. Wrapped
up in that is all sorts of questions about calibration, reliability,
and the plain fact that GPT4 prefers models that output more tokens
per response. This blog dives into these details and the Open LLM
leaderboard. 

DECODING BIASES IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07378?utm_source=tldrai]

Understanding how AI language models react to slight changes in their
inputs is vital for ensuring fairness and usefulness, but it's not an
easy task. A new method called Contrastive Input Decoding (CID) has
been introduced to shed light on these subtle differences by
generating text that reflects the unique characteristics of two
slightly different inputs, thus making the AI's responses more
understandable and manageable. 

RL4F: IMPROVING AI PERFORMANCE WITH COLLABORATIVE FEEDBACK (16 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844?utm_source=tldrai]

RL4F is a new method that uses a smaller, critique-generating AI to
help a much larger AI like GPT-3 fix its mistakes, much like how
humans improve from feedback. By studying different tasks like
planning, summarizing, and alphabetizing, researchers found that this
approach improved the big AI's performance by about 5% on average.
