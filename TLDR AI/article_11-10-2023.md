data.

US WARNS EU‚ÄôS LANDMARK AI POLICY WILL ONLY BENEFIT BIG TECH (6
MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/X14An?utm_source=tldrai]

The US warns the EU that its proposed AI regulations could favor
well-resourced companies and hurt smaller ones. Washington's analysis
criticizes the EU's focus on AI model development rather than the risk
of model use, suggesting it could deter investment and AI R&D in the
EU. The debate continues, aiming for alignment and shared AI
objectives.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LEVERAGE LLMS FOR ENHANCED VIDEO UNDERSTANDING (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05863v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have introduced FAVOR, a new approach that allows large
language models to understand videos by finely blending audio and
visual details at the frame level.

BOOSTING MATHEMATICAL REASONING OF LLMS (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05506v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers investigate the impact of data augmentation techniques on
improving the math reasoning capabilities of large language models.
They create a new dataset, AugGSM8K, by enhancing queries from an
existing dataset and developing a model named MuggleMath.

HUMAN TO ROBOT MOTION RETARGETING (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05310?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have been able to transfer human motion onto robots by
using a deep learning encoder. This is usually done with specialized
hardware that has to be calibrated to the robot. Combining this with
video-based motion capture could be a cool future project!

IMPROVING VISUAL GENERATION WITH A NEW VIDEO TOKENIZATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [https://magvit.cs.cmu.edu/?utm_source=tldrai]

This study introduces MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer that efficiently
translates image and video inputs into tokens for Large Language
Models. With MAGVIT-v2, LLMs surpass the performance of diffusion
models in visual generation tasks.

SPEEDING UP DIFFUSION MODELS FOR TEXT GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05793?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers introduce a new technique for diffusion models used in
text generation. By using a soft absorbing state, they improved how
the model handled discrete text changes, resulting in faster learning
and quicker sampling.

TESTING LLMS IN THE COMPETITIVE WORLD OF AUCTIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jiangjiechen/auction-arena?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have created AucArena, a simulation platform designed to
test Large Language Models in auction settings, which are dynamic and
require strategic thinking. Initial tests show that, with the right
prompts, these models can perform impressively in auctions, showing
skills like budgeting and long-term planning.

AI HYPE IS BUILT ON FLAWED TEST SCORES (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/30/1078670/large-language-models-arent-people-lets-stop-testing-them-like-they-were/?utm_source=tldrai]

A growing number of researchers want to overhaul the way LLMs are
assessed, calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation, as they
believe the practice of scoring machines on human tests is misguided.

8 WAYS SAAS COMPANIES CAN USE AI TO GET AHEAD (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://canny.io/blog/how-saas-can-use-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]

From task automation to writing code, AI is adding leverage to how we
analyze customer data and build products. The key takeaway here is
that AI is enabling people to do a lot more, and if you‚Äôre not using
it, you‚Äôre likely going to get outpaced by your competition.

AI BIAS TESTS GLOSS OVER A CRUCIAL ASPECT OF SKIN COLOR (5 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23902728/ai-bias-skin-tone-hue-sony-research-artificial-intelligence-ethics?utm_source=tldrai]

Sony's AI research suggests a more "multidimensional" approach to
measuring skin color, emphasizing not just lightness/darkness but also
red and yellow hues. Current scales might overlook biases against
certain ethnic groups. Sony recommends the CIELAB color standard, even
as others tout the simplicity of systems like the Monk Skin Tone
Scale. Google and Amazon are reviewing Sony's findings.

GITHUB COPILOT LOSES AN AVERAGE OF $20 PER USER PER MONTH (2 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290661/report-github-copilot-loses-an-average-of-20-per-user-per-month?utm_source=tldrai]

GitHub Copilot costs users $10 per month, but it is costing Microsoft
an average of $20 per user per month. Some users are costing the
company as much as $80 per month. This is likely why Microsoft decided
to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot.
The costs are also likely why the company is developing its own
in-house AI chip sets for its data centers and pushing the adoption of
Neural Processing Units across the industry.
