CHINA RELEASES RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI LIKE CHATGPT AFTER ALIBABA,
BAIDU LAUNCH SERVICES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/china-releases-rules-for-generative-ai-like-chatgpt-after-alibaba-launch.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Chinese regulators on Tuesday released draft rules designed to manage
how companies develop so-called generative artificial intelligence
products like ChatGPT. The Cyberspace Administration of China‚Äôs
draft measures lay out the ground rules that generative AI services
have to follow, including the type of content these products are
allowed to generate. For example, the content generated by AI needs to
reflect the core values of socialism and should not subvert state
power, according to the draft rules.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

REVISITING THE CLASSIC: SCALING RNNS OVER SEQUENCE LENGTH (27 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04057?utm_source=tldrai] 

Context length is a hot topic in AI. We're trying to scale text models
to longer and longer sequences. This work scales an RNN to a million
context tokens. It's not directly applicable, but there are some
lovely nuggets here. 

GENERATIVE AGENTS: INTERACTIVE SIMULACRA OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR (25 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442?utm_source=tldrai] 

Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive
applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces
for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper,
the authors introduce generative agents--computational software agents
that simulate believable human behavior. In an evaluation, these
generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social
behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified
notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the
agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two
days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the
party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right
time. 

VIDEO-KMAX: A SIMPLE UNIFIED APPROACH FOR ONLINE AND NEAR-ONLINE VIDEO
PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04694?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers from Google propose Video-kMaX, a unified approach for
online and near-online Video Panoptic Segmentation, comprising a
within-clip segmenter and a cross-clip associater. By leveraging
clip-kMaX and HiLA-MB for these components, this method establishes a
new state-of-the-art on KITTI-STEP, VIPSeg, and VSPW datasets,
bridging the gap between online and near-online segmentation
approaches.

LIBRARY FOR AI ON TPUS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/google-research/t5x?utm_source=tldrai] 

A challenge in training large text models is fitting them on your
hardware accelerators. This is often easier on TPUs than GPUs due to
Pjit capabilities of Jax. This library (which was used for the
imminently popular FlanT5 models) is easy to use and seems to scale
quite well.
