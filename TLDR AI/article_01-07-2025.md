 APPLE CONSIDERS LETTING ANTHROPIC AND OPENAI POWER SIRI (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Repeated delays have forced Apple to abandon its typically insular
approach. Both companies are training specialized versions of their
models to run on Apple's cloud infrastructure. 

 ZUCKERBERG ANNOUNCES META ‘SUPERINTELLIGENCE' EFFORT, MORE HIRES (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mark Zuckerberg announced a restructuring of Meta's AI division to

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW ORACLE IS WINNING THE AI COMPUTE MARKET (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Oracle has quietly become a key player in the AI compute race,
largely due to the success of its partnership with ByteDance. The two
companies poured billions into data centers in Singapore and Malaysia,
which is now the world's second-largest AI hub. The company was the
single largest lessor of datacenter capacity in the US from late 2023
to early 2025, securing over $130 billion in contracts expected over
the next 12 months, including Stargate deals. 

 MACHINES OF FAITHFUL OBEDIENCE (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI, including AGI and ASI, can significantly benefit humanity if the
technical alignment problem is solved, enabling AIs to follow human
instructions accurately and faithfully. However, rapid AI progress
poses risks, such as reaching alignment "uncanny valleys," potential
arms races, surveillance states, societal upheaval, and misuse in
offensive applications. Ensuring dominance in inference-time compute
with responsible deployment and maintaining human oversight are
critical to mitigating these risks and harnessing AI's potential for
positive global impact.

 THE NEW SKILL IN AI IS NOT PROMPTING, IT'S CONTEXT ENGINEERING (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Building powerful and reliable AI agents is about the engineering of
context and providing the right information and tools in the right
format at the right time. The quality of information loaded into an
agent's limited working memory determines whether it succeeds or
fails. Most agent failures are context failures. Building effective AI
agents is less about complexity and everything to do with the quality
of context provided. 

 THERE ARE NO NEW IDEAS IN AI… ONLY NEW DATASETS (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The next paradigm shift isn't going to come from an improvement to RL
or a fancy new type of neural net. It will come when a new source of
data that hasn't been accessed before is unlocked. One obvious source
of information that a lot of people are working towards harnessing is
video. Another source of information may be unlocked when scientists
figure out how to gather and process information from cameras and
sensors in a way that's amenable to training large models on GPUs. 

 POST-TRAINING VISION-LANGUAGE-ACTION MODELS (27 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This review analyzes post-training strategies for VLA models through
the lens of human motor learning, introducing a taxonomy across
perception, embodiment, and task dimensions.

 AIRTABLE'S LAUNCHES OMNI, AN AGENTIC APP BUILDING ASSISTANT (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Airtable reintroduced itself as an AI-native company, unveiling Omni,
an AI assistant that can build new and edit existing apps, update
datasets, or analyze data with plain language. The company also
launched a suite of agents – web and legal research, document
analysis, and market eval – that can be embedded within business
apps to streamline workflows and operations. 

 MICROSOFT'S CUSTOM AI CHIP HITS DELAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Braga chip won't hit mass production until 2026 after OpenAI
requested last-minute design changes. When it ships, it will likely
lag behind Nvidia's Blackwell, cementing Azure's sole reliance on
Nvidia hardware for another 1 to 2 years.
