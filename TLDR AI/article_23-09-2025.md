 AI MONETIZATION MODELS: LESSONS FROM SNOWFLAKE AND A16Z (SPONSOR) [4]


 How do you price agent outcomes?

Does AI break usage-based pricing?

How do you iterate and experiment on pricing models?

Expect to find answers to these questions—and some interesting
takeaways—in Metronome's new webinar series.

Coming up:

	* OCTOBER 2ND: Ryan Campbell, Snowflake's Director of Product
Finance, reveals how Snowflake built their Monetization Operating
Model [4] to connect product strategy with execution across finance,
product, GTM, and engineering.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NVIDIA AND OPENAI PLAN $100B AI INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Nvidia and OpenAI signed a letter of intent to build data centers
powered by 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, with investments
potentially reaching $100 billion to support future AI model
development. 

 ORACLE APPOINTS NEW CO-CEOS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Oracle has promoted Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEO roles,
signaling a leadership transition as it focuses on scaling its AI
infrastructure capabilities. Former CEO Safra Catz has moved into the
role of executive vice chair of the board. 

 OPENAI MIGHT BE DEVELOPING A SMART SPEAKER, GLASSES, VOICE RECORDER,
AND A PIN (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The mysterious Jony Ive hardware project at OpenAI is taking shape.
OpenAI is working on multiple AI devices, including a smart speaker
without a display, glasses, a voice recorder, and a wearable pin,
targeting late 2026 or early 2027 releases. The company contracts with
Apple suppliers and is actively poaching Apple hardware employees.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY WE BUILT THE RESPONSES API (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI argues its new Responses API is part of the inevitable
evolution from turn-based chats to persistent agentic reasoning that
maintains state across conversation turns. The company claims GPT-5
achieves 5% better performance on TAUBench through preserved reasoning
state and reports 40-80% improved cache utilization. It also adds
hosted tools so developers don't have to build their own retrieval
pipelines from scratch. 

 HOW I USE AI (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI coding requires a mindset shift, emphasizing ownership of
AI-generated code and exploiting opportunities for maximum efficiency.
Success lies in treating AI coding like management, focusing on
creating and leveraging productive gradients where minimal effort
yields significant rewards. Junior engineers might have an advantage
over seniors in adapting to this new role, as embracing AI demands
stepping out of comfort zones and fostering a strong sense of
responsibility. 

 GROK 4 TRAINING RESOURCE FOOTPRINT (1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Grok 4 is the largest (known) training run to date. Researchers
estimate it cost $490 million, required enough electricity to support
a 4,000-person town for a year, and had a carbon footprint roughly
equivalent to annual emissions from 3 airplanes.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 HOW SALESFORCE ENGINEERING USES SLACK FOR DEVOPS TO AIOPS (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Hear directly from the Salesforce engineering and developer teams on
how they're using Slack and AI-powered agents to speed up code
deployment and get time back by automating routine requests. See their
workflow in action. [12] 

 IT'S BEEN AN EXTREMELY BUSY DAY FOR TEAM QWEN (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Qwen recently made several announcements on X, including official FP8
quantized versions of its Qwen3-Next models, Qwen3-TTS-Flash,
Qwen3-Omni, and Qwen-Image-Edit-2509. Qwen3-Omni is a
30-billion-parameter model that supports text, audio, and video input
and text and audio output. More details about the announcement are
available in the article. 

 TOOL CALLS ARE EXPENSIVE AND FINITE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tool calling is many orders of magnitude more costly than calling a
plain old function from code. People should design their agentic
systems according to the limit on how many tool calls their agents can
effectively make. Using a tool call to add two numbers once probably
doesn't matter, but scaling the problem up to 1,000 numbers will
require a long wait and may exceed context window limits. Calling a
function many times in a loop is one of the most common ways to solve
a problem with code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LMARENA HAS SOME COMPETITION: SCALE AI LAUNCHES SEAL SHOWDOWN, A NEW
BENCHMARKING TOOL (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Seal Showdown is a new benchmarking tool that allows users to test
various AI models head-to-head and vote on which one performs better.
Unlike LMArena, it captures real preferences to more closely reflect
how everyday users feel about various models. Rankings are derived
from conversations on Scale's Outlier platform, so each user's
country, education level, profession, language, and age can be
verified. This allows the platform to show which models are most
popular according to specific regions, languages, ages, and use cases.


 DEEPMIND AI SAFETY REPORT EXPLORES THE PERILS OF “MISALIGNED” AI
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DeepMind recently released the third version of its Frontier Safety
Framework, which explores how generative AI systems can become
threats. The safety framework details critical capability levels for
assessing AI models that define the points at which behavior becomes
dangerous. It also discusses ways for developers to address these
risks. Misaligned AIs may ignore human instructions, produce
fraudulent outputs, or refuse to stop operating when requested. For
now, developers can prevent this by monitoring AI's chain of thought
outputs, but future models may hide their reasoning, making it
impossible to determine with certainty that a model is working against
the interests of its human operator.
