HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 THE RAY-BAN META SMART GLASSES HAVE MULTIMODAL AI NOW (5 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Meta has rolled out multimodal AI to its Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses,
allowing users to process photos, audio, and text through voice
commands for tasks like identification and translation, although the
AI's capabilities are limited and sometimes inaccurate. 

 OPENAI ANNOUNCES NEW ENTERPRISE AI FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced new enterprise-grade features for its API
customers, including enhanced security measures, an upgraded
Assistants API, a new Projects feature for granular access control,
and cost management tools. These updates demonstrate OpenAI's focus on
offering a more "plug and play" experience for enterprises, countering
the rise of competitors like Meta's Llama 3 and open models from
Mistral. 

 APPLE WORKING ON ON-DEVICE LLM FOR GENERATIVE AI FEATURES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Apple's LLM will reportedly run entirely on-device rather than via
the cloud like most existing AI services.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PHI 3 (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Phi 3 is a series of models, 3B-14B in size, which perform
exceptionally well on modern benchmarks. The 3B model claims to
outperform the original ChatGPT model. Weights have been released.
There is a variant available with a 128k context length. 

 INTRODUCING SEED-X: MULTIMODAL FOUNDATION MODELS (16 MINUTE READ) [8]


 SEED-X advances multimodal foundation models by tackling real-world
application challenges. It can understand images of any size and
aspect ratio and produce images with varying levels of detail. 

 INSTRUCTION HIERARCHY (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI published research on giving system prompts stronger
weighting, which dramatically improves model robustness to jailbreaks
and adversarial attacks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ü¶ôLEVERAGE THE POWER OF OPEN-SOURCE LLAMA 3 (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Llama 3, Meta's latest achievement in open-source LLMs, is now
available to leverage on OctoAI's super-efficient inference stack.

	* Double the context window of their 2nd gen Llama predecessors
	* Better efficiency in text processing (Llama 3 8b matches Llama 2
70b performance)
	* New, powerful trust and safety tools

Experience Llama 3 firsthand with $10 in free tokens on OctoAI. Sign
up now [10] to get started.

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH MULTIBOOTH (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MultiBooth introduces a two-phase process to enhance multi-concept
image generation, overcoming the challenges of concept fidelity and
high costs found in other methods. 

 EXPLORING LLAMA3'S PERFORMANCE IN LOW-BIT QUANTIZATION (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 Meta's LLaMA3, a leading large language model, is being tested for
its efficiency in low-bit scenarios, often essential in systems with
limited resources. This study, available on GitHub and Hugging Face,
aims to refine and improve quantization strategies for future large
language models. 

 INSTRUCTOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Instructor is a Python library that makes it easy to work with
structured outputs from large language models.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LOS ANGELES IS USING AI IN A PILOT PROGRAM TO TRY TO PREDICT
HOMELESSNESS AND ALLOCATE AID (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services is using
predictive AI to prevent homelessness, identifying at-risk individuals
to provide aid and successfully keeping 86% of participants housed.
The program, initiated in 2021, has assisted nearly 800 households
with over $4,000 in support each. Despite concerns over privacy and
ethics, the AI initiative shows promise in addressing California's
climbing homelessness crisis. 

 SELF-REASONING TOKENS, TEACHING MODELS TO THINK AHEAD (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Recent experiments introduced "Reasoning Tokens" to improve the
thinking process of language models like GPT-2, encouraging them to
make calculations for future tokens. Early results show a 35% decrease
in loss, indicating the models can indeed learn to anticipate future
information. This approach could enhance the ability of language
models to plan and reason in a self-supervised manner, potentially
reducing the need for step-by-step explanations. 

 HOW DOES CHATGPT WORK? AS EXPLAINED BY THE CHATGPT TEAM (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 In this article, OpenAI's Evan Morikawa provides insights into
ChatGPT's inner workings, covering input text processing and
tokenization to prediction sampling using large language models.
ChatGPT operates by turning tokens into numerical vectors
(embeddings), multiplying them by a weight matrix of billions, and
selecting the most probable next word. The tech is grounded in
extensive pretraining to predict text based on vast internet data.
