HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE INVESTS $2B INTO ANTHROPIC (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has committed to a substantial investment in Anthropic, a
competitor to OpenAI, earmarking up to $2 billion for the AI startup. 

 FIRST DIRECTOR OF THE FRONTIER MODELS FORUM NAMED AND BIG TECH ADDS
$10M TO SAFETY INITIATIVE FUNDING (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chris Meserole is the first director of the Frontier Models Forum.
Many large tech companies have added funding to the AI safety fund. 

 AMAZON ADS LAUNCHES AI-POWERED IMAGERY FOR ADVERTISERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Amazon Ads has introduced an AI-powered image generation feature in
beta that creates lifestyle and brand-themed images to improve ad
performances. The tool, which requires no technical expertise, enables
brands to create more engaging ads, reportedly increasing
click-through rates by 40%. It will be rolled out progressively to
advertisers based on customer feedback.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EMULATE TRAINING A LARGE MODEL JUST BY TRAINING A SMALL ONE (28
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Emulator Fine Tuning (EFT) comes from the direct preference
optimization group and explores what happens if you fine tune a small
model and then project that fine tuning onto a large model. This
counterintuitive strategy works shockingly well. 

 IDENTIFYING OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION DATA (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ML models can sometimes wrongly recognize unfamiliar data, thinking
they've seen it before. A new method, NNGuide, helps models make
better decisions, especially when identifying unknown data. 

 TOWARDS MONOSEMANTICITY: DECOMPOSING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH DICTIONARY
LEARNING (60 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers use sparse autoencoders to tackle neural networks'
polysemanticity, extracting clearer features for improved model
understanding. These features influence outputs and exhibit complex
interactions. 

üßë‚Äçüíª 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AUDIOFLARE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 An all-in-one AI audio playground using Cloudflare AI Workers to
transcribe, analyze, summarize, and translate any audio file. 

 A SYSTEM FOR EVALUATING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This study presents "JudgeLM", a new method to efficiently evaluate
Large Language Models in versatile situations. The authors developed a
vast dataset and benchmarking system. 

 MULTI-MODAL PROMPT INJECTION IMAGE ATTACKS AGAINST GPT-4V (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 The new GPT-4V allows for interactive conversations with image inputs
but also introduces new vulnerabilities through visual prompt
injection attacks, enabling exfiltration of data and execution of
hidden instructions encoded in images. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEP LEARNING IN RUST (BOOK) [14] 

 Rust is a popular systems programming language with strong memory
safety. Burn is a framework built on these principles for efficient
ML. Importantly, it offers compatibility with the Onyx runtime. 

 THANKS TO AI, THE FUTURE OF PROGRAMMING MAY INVOLVE YELLING IN ALL
CAPS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's prompts reveal many quirks about prompt engineering. For
example, the prompts use 'please' a lot and important instructions are
often all capitalized. Capitalizing instructions likely works as the
models were trained on huge numbers of examples where responses
clearly paid more attention to capitalized sentences. This could
result in a future where people shout at their computers to get them
to work better. 

 IS AI ALIGNMENT ON TRACK? IS IT PROGRESSING... TOO FAST? (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 AI alignment is a complex issue that lacks concrete benchmarks or
numbers for measurement. Predictions of AI-induced doom rely on
narratives rather than rigorous models. The absence of hard numbers
makes it challenging to assess the state of AI alignment.
