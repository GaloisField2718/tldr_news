 ANTHROPIC REPORTEDLY PREPARING FOR ONE OF THE LARGEST IPOS EVER IN
RACE WITH OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic is considering an IPO while also exploring private funding.
It has reportedly engaged with a law firm and major banks. The IPO
could be one of the largest IPOs ever. No decision has been made yet
on the timing of the IPO. 

 MISTRAL 3 RELEASE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mistral announced the release of Mistral 3, which features three new
dense models (14B, 8B, and 3B) and Mistral Large 3, a sparse MoE model
with 41B active and 675B total parameters. All models are open-sourced
under Apache 2.0. 

 OPENAI CEO DECLARES “CODE RED” AS GEMINI GAINS 200 MILLION USERS
IN 3 MONTHS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI will delay advertising plans and other products to focus on
improving ChatGPT. Google's release of Gemini 3 was very well
received, with the service rapidly gaining popularity. Google is
quickly catching up to ChatGPT in user numbers. ChatGPT has more than
800 million weekly users - Gemini had 650 million in October.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW AI IS TRANSFORMING WORK AT ANTHROPIC (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic surveyed 132 of its own engineers and found 27% of
Claude-assisted work wouldn't have happened otherwise, but not without
costs. Mentorship is declining as Claude is becoming the first stop
for questions. Engineers worry that the skills needed to supervise AI
are the same ones atrophying from overuse. 

 THOUGHTS ON AI PROGRESS (DEC 2025) (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The driver for further improvement will be continual learning.
Solving continual learning will require incremental improvements, just
like solving in-context learning. Labs will likely release something
next year that they will call continual learning, but it will just be
progress towards continual learning. Human-level continual learning
may take another five to ten years of further progress.

 OPTIMIZELY OPAL: AI FOR MARKETERS THAT ACTUALLY LIKE MARKETING
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 There's deja vu, and now there's dejAI vu. Why does every AI tool
feel the same? Because they've been designed to generate text, not to
emotionally engage your target audience. Opal hits different [11] –
it learns your brand, plugs into your workflows and helps your team
show up with work that actually lands. MEET OPAL [10] 

 INTRODUCING AMAZON NOVA FORGE: BUILD YOUR OWN FRONTIER MODELS USING
NOVA (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Amazon Nova Forge is a service for building frontier models using
Nova. It is the easiest and most cost-effective way to build your own
frontier model. Customers can start their development from early model
checkpoints, blend their datasets with Amazon Nova-curated training
data, and host their custom models securely on AWS. The service is
designed for organizations with access to proprietary or
industry-specific data who want to build AI that truly understands
their domain. 

 AGENT SAFETY BENCHMARK BY PERPLEXITY (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 BrowseSafe is a real-time content detection model and benchmark suite
designed to protect AI agents from prompt injection in web browsers.
The open-source BrowseSafe and BrowseSafe-Bench enable developers to
scan HTML for hidden malicious instructions without slowing down
performance, offering layered defenses for safer agentic browsing. 

 RAPTOR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 RAPTOR (Recursive Autonomous Penetration Testing and Observation
Robot) is an autonomous offensive/defensive security research
framework based on Claude Code. It combines traditional security tools
with agentic automation and analysis to deeply understand code, prove
exploitability, and propose patches. The tool empowers security
research with agentic workflows and automation. RAPTOR was vibe-coded
and is still in an early release stage. 

 A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO VERIFYING CODE AT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [15]


 AI coding systems can introduce severe bugs and vulnerabilities, so
it is important to check their work. As models become stronger
generators, their ability to verify, critique, and support human
judgment must scale with them. OpenAI's agentic code reviewer is
optimized for low safety tax and high precision to earn user trust.
The company's testing shows that the code reviewer can deliver
reliable, high-signal feedback without slowing teams down.

 AMP, INC. (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amp is spinning out of Sourcegraph to become an independent research
lab. Its goal is to let software builders harness the full power of
AI. The company believes that the way we develop software will be
challenged fundamentally and drastically. Spinning out into its own
company will give it more freedom to focus on the frontier.
