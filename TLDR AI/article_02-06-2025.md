DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY DEEPSEEK IS CHEAP AT SCALE BUT EXPENSIVE TO RUN LOCALLY (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Models that are Mixture-of-Experts with many layers, like DeepSeek,
require large batch sizes and high latency otherwise throughput drops
off a cliff. This is why it is commonly said that DeepSeek can't be
easily run for personal use - with a single user running one inference
at a time, it runs at a very low efficiency/throughput. This article
explains this phenomenon in detail, as well as why some AI models are
slow to respond but fast once they get going and the other effects of
throughput, latency, and batch sizes. 

 THE TRACKERS AND SDKS IN CHATGPT, CLAUDE, GROK, AND PERPLEXITY (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post looks at which third-party SDKs and API calls can be found
in the four biggest Android AI chat apps: ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and
Perplexity. It looks at each app's development tools, business tools,
product and marketing analytics, monetizations, and the API calls
recorded by each app while open. 

 BOND CAPITAL RELEASES COMPREHENSIVE 340-SLIDE REPORT ON AI TRENDS (90
MINUTE READ) [10]

rates, with ChatGPT achieving global penetration in three years
compared to the internet's 23-year timeline. The report covers AI
chatbots now being mistaken for humans 73% of the time (up from 50%
six months ago), inference costs plunging 99% since 2022, and
enterprise adoption accelerating beyond experimental phases.

 DO YOU EVEN HAVE A SYSTEM PROMPT? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Most people either skip system prompts or write short, unoptimized
paragraphs, missing significant gains from personalized AI behavior.
Users should systematically test and iterate on a system prompt
instead of providing feedback on poor outputs in siloed chat threads.
The comment section of this post includes a selection of
community-provided system prompts.
