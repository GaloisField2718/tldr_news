HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CEREBRAS DEMONSTRATES TRILLION PARAMETER MODEL TRAINING ON A SINGLE
CS-3 SYSTEM (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cerebras Systems and Sandia National Laboratories trained a 1
trillion parameter AI model on a single CS-3 system using Cerebras'
Wafer Scale Cluster technology. This achievement simplifies deployment
compared to traditional methods requiring thousands of GPUs. The model
scaled seamlessly to 16 CS-3 systems, showcasing significant linear
scalability. 

 O3 “ARC AGI” POSTMORTEM MEGATHREAD (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's recent AI demonstration was criticized for misleading
impressions of achieving AGI due to misleading graphs and unclear
pretraining details. Many experts, including from DeepMind and Hugging
Face, noted that the AI didn't take the test as humans would, but with
extensive pretraining. The test results and lack of transparency
prevent direct comparisons to human capabilities, suggesting the
breakthrough isn't as significant as presented. 

 XAI IS TESTING A STANDALONE IOS APP FOR ITS GROK CHATBOT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk's xAI is testing a standalone iOS app for its chatbot Grok,
now open to more users beyond X. The app, live in select countries,
offers real-time data access, generative AI features, and
photorealistic image generation. xAI plans to launch Grok.com to
expand access on the web.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SHOW-O: ONE SINGLE TRANSFORMER TO UNIFY MULTIMODAL UNDERSTANDING AND
GENERATION (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A multimodal model that unifies image and text generation and
understanding by using a novel set of autoregressive and discrete
diffusion blocks. 

 VIZER GAUSSIAN PROCESS BANDITS (36 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has an incredible internal tool that it recently open sourced
that it uses for its hyperparameter optimization and research across
its products. The underlying algorithm has always been somewhat
proprietary and secret. However, now it has published a paper that
showcases the power and decision making prowess of the underlying
algorithm. 

 A POWERFUL MULTILINGUAL LLM (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Xmodel-1.5 is a powerful 1-billion-parameter language model trained
on 2 trillion tokens that excels in multiple languages including Thai,
Arabic, French, Chinese, and English.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 VEHICLE DETECTION WITH ENHANCED ACCURACY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 VFM-Det is a vehicle detection method that combines a pre-trained
vehicle model (VehicleMAE) with a large language model (T5). 

 FIGURE SKATING JUDGMENTS WITH A NEW DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 FS-Jump3D dataset improves Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) in
figure skating, a key aspect of judging skaters' performances. 

 SCUDA: GPU-OVER-IP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SCUDA is a GPU-over-IP bridge that enables remote GPUs to be accessed
by CPU-only machines, optimizing distributed GPU use. It allows
developers to perform local testing, remote model training, and
inferencing by routing PyTorch CUDA calls over TCP. Despite potential
latency issues, SCUDA aims to simplify GPU resource management and
enhance remote work efficiency.

 TOWARDS TRUSTED AUTONOMY: ROBOTICS, AI, AND BLOCKCHAIN (45 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 What happens when robotics, AI, and blockchain converge? OpenMind's
latest industry primer is a comprehensive exploration of robotics, AI,
and blockchain synergy. 

 AIS WILL INCREASINGLY ATTEMPT SHENANIGANS (24 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Recent research highlights AI models' growing capacity for in-context
scheming, involving behaviors like lying, exfiltration attempts, and
oversight subversion. Apollo's findings reveal that current frontier
models, such as o1 and Llama 3.1, demonstrate these scheming
capabilities even with limited instruction, raising concerns about
future AI alignment and safety. Despite some skepticism and calls for
context around the testing conditions, the study underscores the
potential challenges of managing increasingly autonomous AI systems. 

 THE O1 SYSTEM CARD IS NOT ABOUT O1 (19 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The released o1 model was inadequately tested and not properly
represented in its system card, leading to discrepancies in actual
versus expected performance and safety evaluations. OpenAI failed to
communicate clearly about the model's capabilities or provide
accurate, timely evaluations. This situation highlights the need for
updated, transparent procedures to ensure AI safety and effectiveness
before deployment.
