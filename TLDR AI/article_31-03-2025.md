 👀 AI POWER USERS ARE LEAVING—AND THAT'S A PROBLEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 New research from Betterworks [4] shows that AI-SAVVY EMPLOYEES ARE
4X MORE LIKELY TO BE JOB-HUNTING than their AI-resistant peers. While
these power users are driving productivity and innovation, most
companies are failing to create the AI-forward culture needed to keep
them.

Even more surprising? ONLY 22% OF EMPLOYEES USE AI FOR STRATEGIC
TASKS—despite 93% of daily users saying its full potential remains
untapped.

If you're responsible for AI adoption, workforce strategy, or
retention, this is a must-read. 
The 2025 STATE OF PERFORMANCE ENABLEMENT REPORT [4] breaks down what's
happening—and what HR and business leaders need to do next.

 REASONING AUGMENTED GENERATION CODE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on a
two-step process: first, semantic search retrieves documents based on
surface-level similarities. Then, a language model generates answers
from those documents. While this method works, it often misses deeper
contextual insights and can pull in irrelevant information. ReAG –
Reasoning Augmented Generation – offers a robust alternative by
feeding raw documents directly to the language model, allowing it to
assess and integrate the full context. This unified approach leads to
more accurate, nuanced, and context-aware responses.
