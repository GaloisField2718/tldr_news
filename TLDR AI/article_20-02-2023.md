HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

GITHUB COPILOT GETS AN UPGRADE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-now-has-a-better-ai-model-and-new-capabilities/?utm_source=tldrai]


With a stronger underlying model, new light-weight client side model,
and Fill-In-the-Middle (FIM) capabilities, Copilot has improved
consistently since launch. The acceptance rate of synthesized code has
gone from 27% to 35%! 

HOW SHOULD AI SYSTEMS BEHAVE, AND WHO SHOULD DECIDE? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave/?utm_source=tldrai]


ChatGPT users have raised concerns about biased or objectionable
outputs. ChatGPT's behavior is shaped by fine-tuning massive neural
networks, but the process is imperfect. The company is working to
improve its methods for aligning AI systems with human values, and
this blog post summarizes how ChatGPT's behavior is shaped, how the
company plans to improve it, and its efforts to get more public input
on its decision-making. 

CODA AI: (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://coda.io/product/ai-alpha?utm_source=tldrai] 

If you‚Äôre a Coda power user, you‚Äôll love Coda AI. Combine the
power of Coda‚Äôs building blocks with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT to accelerate
your document creation. Coda AI also integrates with 600+ other
applications to improve your workflow.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

1B MULTIMODAL MODEL OUT PERFORMS 175B COUNTERPART (33 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00923?utm_source=tldrai] 

Narrow models can still, unsurprisingly, beat larger general purpose
models. This paper is another example, the authors use a small
multimodal model to beat GPT3 by 16% on the visual / text benchmark
ScienceQA. It's only one benchmark, but it's good to see improvements
on more reasonably sized models. 

THE STABLE ENTROPY HYPOTHESIS (45 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06784?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper submits an hypothesis that ‚Äúhuman-like‚Äù text generation
lies in a narrow region of low entropy. Degenerate text which has
repeated words, incoherent sentences, and grammatical errors lie away
from this region. They provide supporting evidence and present an
entropy aware decoding scheme. 

MORAL SELF-CORRECTION IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07459?utm_source=tldrai] 

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit harmful biases that can get worse
with size. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) helps,
but not always enough. The authors show that simple prompting
approaches can help LLMs trained with RLHF produce less harmful
outputs.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

NAVIGATING THE MANIFOLD OF LATENTS IN STABLE DIFFUSION (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://artste.github.io/blog/posts/real-images-island?utm_source=tldrai]


This blog post offers a simple, intuitive metaphor to understand the
manifold of latents in Stable Diffusion and diffusion-based generative
models. The author shares their journey of exploring the latent space
and various techniques to navigate it, offering insights into the main
components of Stable Diffusion. The article is a good resource for
those interested in controlling image generation and interpolation
between them. 

LANGCHAIN FOR THE WEB (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs?utm_source=tldrai] 

Similar to other recently released libraries, Langchain now has a
JavaScript library. Use this to build LM powered web apps.
Importantly, interfacing with the python version is a huge focus
specifically around serialization of objects. 

TALK-TO-CHATGPT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/C-Nedelcu/talk-to-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai] 

Talk-To-ChatGPT is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to talk
with ChatGPT using their voice and listen to the AI‚Äôs answer with a
voice.

SCALING MEDIA ML AT NETFLIX (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-media-machine-learning-at-netflix-f19b400243?utm_source=tldrai]


In this blog, Netflix outlines how their media and artwork ML pipeline
works and scales. They discuss preprocessing, training,
productionizing and storage. The article presents a case study
demonstrating how these components improve an existing pipeline's
scalability, optimization, and reliability. There are some interesting
tidbits here specifically that they use Ray to power their GPU
cluster. 

HOW TO FINE-TUNE THE MOST POWERFUL OPEN SOURCE LLM (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.philschmid.de/fine-tune-flan-t5-deepspeed?utm_source=tldrai]


FlanT5 may be one of the best available open source language models.
The largest versions (3B and 11B parameters) are the most performant
but hardest to tune because of the need for parallelism. This post
outlines how to use deepspeed to tune these models across multiple
GPUs for summarization. 

THE PHYSICS PRINCIPLE THAT INSPIRED MODERN AI ART (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.wired.com/story/the-physics-principle-that-inspired-modern-ai-art/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article dives into the system that underpins DALL-E and other
generative AI models, which is heavily inspired by nonequilibrium
thermodynamics.

AI CAN HELP DESIGN OPIOID DRUGS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-opioid-addiction-22531/?utm_source=tldrai]


Artificial Intelligence is now being used to design drugs that block
the kappa-opioid receptor, the key receptor in fighting against opioid
drugs, much faster than humans.

AI BECOMES SILICON VALLEY‚ÄôS NEXT BUZZY BANDWAGON AS CRYPTO BOOM
FIZZLES (4 MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/y0Ta6?utm_source=tldrai] 

Technologists agree that the generative AI that powers systems like
ChatGPT has the potential to change how we live and work, despite the
technology‚Äôs clear flaws. But some people see signs of froth that
remind them of the crypto boom that recently fizzled.
