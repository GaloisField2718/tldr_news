HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ETCHED RAISES $120M SERIES A TO BUILD AI CHIPS FOR TRANSFORMERS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Etched has announced a $120M round led by Primary Venture Partners
and Positive Sum Ventures, as well as angel investors including Peter
Thiel, Stanley Druckenmiller, and David Siegel. It is working directly
with TSMC's Emerging Business Group to produce chips on their
state-of-the-art, 4 nanometer node. Its chips can achieve 500K
tokens/second. One 8xSohu can replace 160 H100s. 

 STABILITY AI NEW FUNDING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 In addition to a new CEO, Stability AI was able to secure a
‚Äúsignificant infusion of capital‚Äù from existing and new investors.


 APPLE INTELLIGENCE AND AI MAXIMALISM (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple is segmenting its AI approach, differentiating between
'context' and 'world' models, with the latter, such as ChatGPT, being
used for open-ended queries but without personal context. OpenAI's
position is not highly defensible, given the lack of moats in large
language models (LLMs) and the rise of competing models. Apple's
strategy suggests a commoditization trend for LLMs that leverages
on-device capabilities and private cloud to provide AI features while
viewing services like ChatGPT as interchangeable components.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 RAG FINE-TUNING (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Together AI and Morph Labs have put together a great blog post on
tuning models for retrieval augmented generation. They showcase some
uses of synthetic data as well. 

 IMBUE TRAINS 70B THAT MATCHES GPT-4 (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Imbue has trained and released an extremely powerful 70B language
model. It uses Imbue's custom optimizer and some great data filtering
techniques. The model was trained with zero loss spikes. 

 EVALALIGN FOR TEXT-TO-IMAGE EVALUATION (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 EvalAlign is a new metric designed to improve the evaluation of
text-to-image generative models. Unlike existing metrics, EvalAlign
offers fine-grained accuracy and stability. It focuses on image
faithfulness and text-image alignment.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EASILY DEPLOY ML MODELS AT THE EDGE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Bring inference closer to your users with Gcore [12]. Use a single
endpoint that's automatically deployed where you need it and never
worry about managing GPUs and containers [12]. Reduce latency, enable
ultra-fast responses for your AI-powered apps, and double the value
you deliver to users. Create a free account [12] 

 FINE-TUNE FLORENCE 2 (14 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Microsoft's new many-to-many vision model can be tuned for specific
downstream tasks. It isn't quite as powerful as PaliGemma, but is easy
to run in PyTorch. 

 2:4 SPARSE TRAINING IN PYTORCH (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The PyTorch team has written custom kernels to make use of sparse
cores, which are usually reserved for inference only. 

 CONTROL VIDEO GENERATION TRAJECTORIES WITHOUT TRAINING (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 FreeTraj is a tuning-free method to control the motion trajectories
in video generation using diffusion models. It modifies noise sampling
and attention mechanisms to guide the generated content. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOLECULAR MODELING WITH TRANSFORMER (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 GeoMFormer is a new Transformer-based model designed to improve
molecular modeling by learning both invariant and equivariant
features. 

 MAKING MY LOCAL LLM VOICE ASSISTANT FASTER AND MORE SCALABLE WITH RAG
(6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers were able to make an LLM voice assistant more efficient
and scalable by categorizing data, precomputing embeddings, and
dynamically generating examples. 

 HOW TO SOLVE LLM HALLUCINATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Lamini has developed Memory Tuning to reduce hallucinations by 95%,
embedding specific data into models more efficiently without
compromising general knowledge.
