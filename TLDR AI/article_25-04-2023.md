AI IS REALLY GOOD FOR LOW SKILLED WORKERS (50 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161?utm_source=tldrai] 

When a conversational AI tool is used to support customer support they
get a big boost, somewhere around 14% on average with an increase in
employee AND customer satisfaction. Interestingly, it seems like the
biggest bump is for lower skilled support agents. This might be
because they now have access to a broad knowledge base that was hard
to get before. This also increased employee retention. They don‚Äôt
touch on wage effects of these tools, but merely explore potential
productivity gains. 

GEN-1 ON IOS (1 MINUTE READ) [https://runwayml.com/?utm_source=tldrai]


Runway introduces the new iOS app featuring Gen-1, which allows users
to transform their phone's camera content and revive forgotten videos.


GOOGLE RELEASES SECURITY LLM (2 MINUTE READ)

Google has announced the release of Google Cloud Security AI
Workbench, a security platform powered by Sec-PaLM, a large language
model (LLM) designed specifically for cybersecurity use cases.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GIVE LANGUAGE MODELS ANXIETY? (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11111?utm_source=tldrai] 

There are certain types of phrases that are used in computational
psychiatry and are known to elicit or measure anxiety. As it turns
out, if we use these and other emotion causing prompts, ChatGPT
responds strongly. It also increases its ability to explore and its
bias in some settings. 

IS ADAM ACTUALLY THE BEST, OR DID WE MAKE IT THE BEST? (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://parameterfree.com/2020/12/06/neural-network-maybe-evolved-to-make-adam-the-best-optimizer/?utm_source=tldrai]


Many folks use a variant of Adam such as AdamW, but for the most part
Adam is still the default architecture for deep learning. It is
certainly what we often start with. What if it‚Äôs only the best
because it‚Äôs the one thing researchers don‚Äôt change when they
explore the deep learning performance? There is a line of philosophy
around this including the hardware lottery. This is a hard problem to
fix, mostly because jointly developing an optimizer and architecture
is challenging. 

DIFFFIT: UNLOCKING TRANSFERABILITY OF LARGE DIFFUSION MODELS VIA
SIMPLE PARAMETER-EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING (22 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06648?utm_source=tldrai] 

DiffFit, a parameter-efficient strategy for fine-tuning large
pre-trained diffusion models, enables fast adaptation to new domains
while significantly reducing training time and storage costs.
Achieving superior performance on downstream datasets, DiffFit sets a
new state-of-the-art FID on the ImageNet 512x512 benchmark and
demonstrates its potential for adapting low-resolution models to
high-resolution ones with minimal cost.

VISFUSION: VISIBILITY-AWARE ONLINE 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION FROM VIDEOS
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/huiyu-gao/VisFusion?utm_source=tldrai] 

VisFusion is a visibility-aware online 3D scene reconstruction method
from posed monocular videos, improving feature fusion by inferring
visibility using a similarity matrix calculated from projected
features in each image pair. The approach employs a coarse-to-fine
pipeline with a volume sparsification process, preserving fine details
by sparsifying voxels locally along each visual ray, and enhancing
TSDF predictions through learning residuals across scales. 

SILVR: GUIDED DIFFUSION FOR MOLECULE GENERATION (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10905?utm_source=tldrai] 

The selective iterative latent variable refinement (SILVR) method
conditions diffusion-based equivariant generative models without
retraining, generating novel molecules that fit a protein's binding
site based on fragment hits. Using the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease
fragments as a reference dataset, SILVR demonstrates the ability to
generate new molecules with similar shapes to original fragments,
fitting the binding site without knowledge of the protein, and merging
up to three fragments into a new molecule without affecting the
underlying generative model's quality.

WHY AGENTS ARE THE NEXT KILLER AI APP (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.latent.space/p/agents?utm_source=tldrai] 

This article makes the case that autonomous agents like Auto-GPT are
the next big use-case for AI. Auto-GPT (and its younger sibling
BabyAGI) are independently developed Python projects that have caught
enormous popularity, with Auto-GPT trending #1 on Twitter and GitHub
in the past 2 weeks.

This article dives into the playbooks of some of the larger AI
doomers. AI Doomerism is becoming mainstream thanks to mass media,
which drives our discussion about Generative AI from bad to worse, or
from slightly insane to batshit crazy. Instead of out-of-control AI,
we have out-of-control panic.
