HUMANLOOP: SHIP DIFFERENTIATED LLM FEATURES AND APPS (SPONSOR)
[https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20230621] 

You‚Äôll need more than an OpenAI API key to ship AI products that are
fast, accurate, and unique
[https://humanloop.com/?utm_source=tldr&utm_campaign=20230621].
Large language models can ‚Äòhallucinate‚Äô or produce repetitive
results if left unchecked. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs hard to build
something that feels differentiated when everyone is using the same
tech.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

OPENAI PLANS AN APP STORE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/9NgN7?utm_source=tldrai] 

OpenAI plans to launch a marketplace that will allow developers to
sell their AI models built on top of its own AI technology. 

EMERGING ARCHITECTURES FOR LLM APPLICATIONS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article by a16z discusses some of the emerging architectures for
LLM applications, including federated learning, edge computing, and
serverless computing. These architectures offer new ways to scale LLMs
and make them more efficient, which could lead to wider adoption of
LLMs in the future. 

OPENAI LOBBIED EU TO WATER DOWN REGULATION (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI has lobbied for significant elements of the most comprehensive
AI legislation in the world‚Äîthe E.U.‚Äôs AI Act‚Äîto be watered down
in ways that would reduce regulatory burden on the company.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DEEPMIND'S NEW ROBOTICS CONTROLLER (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent?utm_source=tldrai]


Gato came out about a year ago and was immediately the talk of the
town. RoboCat, a system built on top of Gato, is an embodied agent
that can learn in as few as 100 steps for a new task. It seems like an
exciting new step in language enabled robotics. 

A NOVEL APPROACH TO COLLABORATIVE IMAGE RECOGNITION (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09607v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

PhotoBook is an interactive game in which two players find common
images from their own private sets, pushing machines to learn
human-like communication around visual context. The approach, based on
the DeBERTa model and CLIPScore features, bypasses the need for
reference chains, directly predicting whether an image is shared.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

LOMO: EFFICIENT LLM TRAINING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/openlmlab/lomo?utm_source=tldrai] 

This research introduces LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), an optimizer
designed to dramatically decrease the resources needed for Large
Language Models (LLMs) training, a process that currently requires
extensive GPU resources. LOMO's innovative approach allows the
fine-tuning of a 65 billion parameter model using just a single
machine with 8 RTX 3090 GPUs, each with 24GB memory, reducing memory
usage to just 10.8% of the standard method. 

CLIP2PROTECT: A METHOD FOR PROTECTING FACIAL PRIVACY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/fahadshamshad/clip2protect?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Clip2Protect project introduces an innovative two-step approach to
ensure facial privacy, especially in an age of powerful face
recognition systems. It creates 'makeup' faces that look natural, yet
fool facial recognition software, showing significantly better
performance than previous privacy-enhancing methods. 

AUTOLABEL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/refuel-ai/autolabel?utm_source=tldrai] 

Autolabel is a Python library to label, clean and enrich text datasets
with any Large Language Models (LLM) of your choice.

ASSET MANAGERS PRESSURE TECH COMPANIES OVER AI MISUSE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/tENu3?utm_source=tldrai] 

Institutional investors are increasing pressure on technology
companies to take responsibility for the potential misuse of
artificial intelligence as they become concerned about the liability
for human rights issues linked to the software. 

NEED TO DEDUP LOTS OF DATA? (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/dedup?utm_source=tldrai] 

The quality of the training mix for AI models is key to getting good
performance. In code models, deduplication of data tends to matter
quite a bit. It's not clear if it matters as much for text. However,
in any case, this blog presents a great description of the techniques
used to deduplicate large data sets of text-like data. 

WHAT I LEARNT AFTER WRITING 25+ ARTICLES BY USING AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.is/Zr8HV?utm_source=tldrai] 

AI should be used as a tool to enhance productivity, imagination, and
creativity, and not as a means of automation. This article provides
insights on how to use AI without sacrificing quality.
