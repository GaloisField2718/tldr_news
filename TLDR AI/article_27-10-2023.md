RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMAGE DIFFUSION MODEL TRAINED ON OPEN DATA (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16825?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Most popular diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have been trained
on a wide variety of data, but much of that data is subject to
different copyright restrictions. This new model from MosaicML is
trained purely on Creative Commons data and achieves similar
performance to SD 2 while requiring only a fraction of the training
data. 

 4-BIT QUANTIZATION IN LLMS (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16836v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This research introduces LLM-FP4, a novel method to compress large
language models by converting their weights and actions to 4-bit
floating-point values after training. 

 EVALUATING GPT-4V'S OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION ABILITIES (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16809v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 The paper examines how well GPT-4V, a Large Multimodal Model,
performs in various Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, from
reading scenes and handwritten texts to understanding complex document
structures.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 REAL-TIME DEPTH ESTIMATION FOR UNDERWATER VEHICLES (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ebnerluca/uw_depth?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This study presents a model tailored for underwater vehicles that can
estimate real-time depth from single images by combining sparse depth
details. 

 GPT PILOT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot?utm_source=tldrai] 

 GPT Pilot is an AI-powered dev tool that writes scalable apps from
scratch. It enables developers to create apps using a description of
the kind of app they want to build. GPT Pilot creates apps
step-by-step while asking questions for clarification or help when it
gets stuck. A video demo is available in the repository. 

 TORA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/microsoft/ToRA?utm_source=tldrai] 

 ToRA is a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to
solve challenging mathematical reasoning problems by interacting with
tools.

 THE CONVERGENCE OF DATA AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN THE AGE OF AI (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://tomtunguz.com/data-engineering/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 AI needs data to work, meaning data functions are getting closer to
the core of the product-building process and moving away from internal
business intelligence. 

 A VERSATILE APPROACH FOR PIXEL MATCHING IN IMAGES (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/aim-uofa/rgm?utm_source=tldrai] 

 The study introduces RGM (Robust Generalist Matching), a deep
learning model designed for both sparse and dense pixel matching in
images. The method leverages a unique cascaded GRU module and a new
large-scale dataset. 

 REDDIT THREATENS TO BLOCK GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925504/reddit-deny-force-log-in-see-posts-ai-companies-deals?utm_source=tldrai]


 Reddit may block search crawlers if it can't reach deals with
generative AI companies to pay for its data. More than 535 news
organizations have opted to block their content from being scraped by
AI companies. X's new reading limits are due to data scraping by AI
startups.
