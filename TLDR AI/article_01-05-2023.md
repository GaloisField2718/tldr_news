INSTRUCTCTG: CONTROLLED TEXT GENERATION WITH NATURAL LANGUAGE
INSTRUCTIONS (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14293?utm_source=tldrai] 

INSTRUCTCTG is a controlled text generation framework that
incorporates various constraints by using natural language
descriptions and demonstrations. This flexible approach maintains
generation quality and speed, and allows the model to adapt to new
constraints without retraining through few-shot task generalization
and in-context learning. 

PUTTING PEOPLE IN THEIR PLACE: AFFORDANCE-AWARE HUMAN INSERTION INTO
SCENES (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14406?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study presents a method for realistically inserting people into
scenes while respecting scene affordances, using a self-supervised
approach and a large-scale diffusion model. The model synthesizes more
realistic human appearances and natural human-scene interactions
compared to previous work, and enables interactive editing. 

DOES CHATGPT MAKE HIGH VARIANCE DECISIONS? (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://yourway.substack.com/p/ai-vs-humans-a-noise-audit-in-decision?utm_source=tldrai]


‚ÄúNoise‚Äù in business decision making ‚Äúrefers to the unwanted
variability in judgments that should be consistent in similar
cases‚Äù. ChatGPT outputs can be noisy, as determined by temperature,
how does that translate to business decisions? It turns out ChatGPT is
almost 4x better than tested humans at making consistent and low noise
decisions. Cool work about potential real world impacts.

LLAMA-ADAPTER V2 (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter?utm_source=tldrai] 

LLaMA-Adapter V2 is an improved, parameter-efficient model that
enhances large language models' ability to follow instructions and
incorporate visual knowledge. By optimizing learnable parameters and
incorporating expert models, it performs better in multi-modal
reasoning and chat interactions. 

CHATVIDEO: A MULTIMODAL VIDEO UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.wangjunke.info/ChatVideo/?utm_source=tldrai] 

ChatVideo is a prototype system for versatile and multimodal video
understanding, using a tracklet-centric paradigm and Video Foundation
Models (ViFMs) to annotate properties. This approach demonstrates
effectiveness in addressing diverse video-related problems in
real-world scenarios. 

STABLE VICUNA CHATBOT (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://stability.ai/blog/stablevicuna-open-source-rlhf-chatbot?utm_source=tldrai]


Chat systems like ChatGPT are powered by large language models and
have been tuned by human preferences to generate realistic and useful
conversations. The models that power these systems are kept
underwraps. Stability AI has released a language model that behaves
similarly to chatGPT but is mostly open source. It isn‚Äôt quite as
powerful, and has some commercial license restrictions.
