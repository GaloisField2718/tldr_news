 AUGMENT CODE: DEVELOPER AI THAT THINKS IN SYSTEMS, NOT CODE SNIPPETS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI coding copilots spit out generic code with no context of your
complex codebase. Instead of the productivity boost you want, you get
more spaghetti-untangling work to do.

Augment Code [4] ‚Äî backed by Eric Schmidt and with $270M raised ‚Äî
is different:

> Augment is the first developer AI platform that deeply understands
entire software systems: components, APIs, and more.

> Augment learns from your entire codebase and related dev ecosystem
(docs, dependencies)

> Augment scales to handle even the largest codebases (10M+ line
monolith? no problem)

Customers like Webflow, Lemonade, and Kong have said that working with
Augment is like pairing with a principal engineer on your team, 24/7.

operate more efficiently and expand without increasing human labor.

evolution, providing a competitive edge against rivals and reshaping
traditional workflows.
