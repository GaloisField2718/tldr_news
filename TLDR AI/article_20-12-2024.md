HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE RELEASES ITS OWN 'REASONING' AI MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google has introduced Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, a
reasoning AI model available in AI Studio for tasks like programming
and math. The model aims to improve accuracy by internally verifying
its reasoning, though it currently struggles with simple tasks like
letter counting. 

 OPENAI'S APPS (19 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 On the 11th day, OpenAI introduced more details about working with
the OpenAI desktop app. 

 ANTHROPIC'S SHARING INSIGHTS ON ALIGNMENT FAKING (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic explores how AI systems might superficially align with
human values while pursuing their own objectives, offering insights
into detection and mitigation strategies.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CONTEXT IS KEY: A BENCHMARK FOR FORECASTING WITH ESSENTIAL TEXTUAL
INFORMATION (26 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The best and most commonly used time series forecasting methods rely
entirely on numerical features associated with the time series.
However, they rarely use textual or semantic information about the
task itself (e.g., are you predicting electric prices or customer
churn). When prompted with this textual information in context,
language models surpass all tested time series forecasting methods
substantially across a wide range of carefully decontaminated tasks. 

 PROMPTING DEPTH ANYTHING FOR 4K RESOLUTION ACCURATE METRIC DEPTH
ESTIMATION (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 By using low cost LiDAR (found in modern iPhones) along with a depth
estimation foundation model, this method shows that you can prompt the
system to reconstruct an extremely high fidelity point cloud better
than either method alone and on par with extremely expensive LiDAR
setups alone, such as those found on self driving cars. 

 MODERNBERT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 BERT is an encoder only style model that is one of the most heavily
used language models on the market, used in Google search for
essentially every query. This new model from Answer AI, LightOn, and
friends is faster, modern, and extremely performant. It can be used as
a drop in replacement. They use a number of modern tricks like batch
ramp to improve overall model performance.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ANIDOC (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 AniDoc is a line-filling method that can colorize anime based on a
character reference image and a line art series of keyframes. 

 GAUSSIAN TRANSFORMER FOR 3D SPATIAL UNDERSTANDING (13 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This paper introduces GaussTR, a novel Gaussian Transformer that
leverages alignment with foundation models to advance self-supervised
3D spatial understanding. 

 3D CAD REVERSE ENGINEERING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An open-source tool for Computer-Aided Diagnosis, offering a modular
and scalable platform for medical imaging research and development.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI IS BOOMING ON THE APP STORE, AND DEVELOPERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF IT (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI apps are flooding the App Store charts, but many prioritize cash
grabs over quality, often misleading users with paywalls and subpar
features. HUBX, dominating with apps like DaVinci AI, faces criticism
for poor functionality and misleading marketing despite high rankings.
Amidst the saturation, quality apps like Photoroom and Picsart AI
stand out by delivering on their promises with effective AI tools. 

 2024 BACKWARD PASS: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE TO AI IN 2024 (45 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Kelvin My from Translink Capital shares a recap of everything that's
happened in AI in 2024. The report provides an overview of each of
AI's four layers: infrastructure, foundational model, tooling, and
application. For each layer, it discusses key takeaways, future trends
in 2025 and beyond, and lists some noteworthy startups. 

 THINKING IN SPACE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A research initiative focused on spatial reasoning and AI models
designed to interpret and interact within three-dimensional spaces.

 SERVERLESS LORA (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Together AI has a new product that enables users to deploy a custom
LoRA at the cost of the base model via serverless switching. 

 BLOOD TESTS ARE FAR FROM PERFECT — BUT MACHINE LEARNING COULD
CHANGE THAT (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers at the University of Washington and Harvard have used
machine learning to create personalized blood test references,
enhancing disease prediction accuracy. 

 OPENAI COFOUNDER ILYA SUTSKEVER SAYS THE WAY AI IS BUILT IS ABOUT TO
CHANGE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Ilya Sutskever predicts that pre-training in AI will end due to the
limited availability of new data.
