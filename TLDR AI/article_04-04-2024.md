HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABLE AUDIO 2.0 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Stability AI has announced the next generation of its music
generation model. Trained on properly licensed music, the model can
generate up to 3 minutes of high-quality music. It also has
audio-to-audio generation. 

 OPERA ALLOWS USERS TO DOWNLOAD AND USE LLMS LOCALLY (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Opera has launched a new feature that allows users to download and
run large language models locally on their computers, with over 150
models from more than 50 families available. 

 SCIENTISTS CREATE AI MODELS THAT CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER AND PASS ON
SKILLS WITH LIMITED HUMAN INPUT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have developed an AI network where one AI can teach
another to perform tasks using natural language processing, a
capability not previously demonstrated. The system uses a model called
S-Bert that allows AI to perform tasks given via instructions and then
communicate that knowledge to another AI. This breakthrough has
potential applications in robotics and could further understanding of
human cognitive functions.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 REALKIE: FIVE NOVEL DATASETS FOR ENTERPRISE KEY INFORMATION
EXTRACTION (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Extracting information from datasets is critical for enterprise AI
applications. These five new benchmark datasets can be used to measure
general algorithmic performance for RAG applications. 

 BOOSTING TRANSFORMER EFFICIENCY (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed DiJiang, a new approach that transforms
existing Transformers into leaner, faster models without the heavy
burden of retraining. 

 AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WITH WORLD-CENTRIC DIFFUSION TRANSFORMERS (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This study introduces a new method for creating driving paths for
autonomous vehicles that combines diffusion models and transformers in
a system called "World-Centric Diffusion Transformer" (WcDT).

 3D DETECTION FOR LARGE OBJECTS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SeaBird is a new 3D detection method that excels at recognizing large
objects where traditional monocular detectors falter. 

 CAN AI IDENTIFY UNSOLVABLE PROBLEMS? (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project introduces the concept of Unsolvable Problem Detection
(UPD) in Vision Language Models, a new test to see if AI can identify
when a problem can't be solved. 

 ACTION SPOTTING IN SOCCER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ASTRA is a Transformer-based model that is capable of identifying key
moments during soccer matches and overcoming challenges like action
localization and data imbalance.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHEN WILL THE GENAI BUBBLE BURST? (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 That Generative AI may turn out to be a disappointment. There are
concerns about the technology's lack of profitability, security
issues, and the inherent problem of hallucinations in language models.
Unless a groundbreaking model like GPT-5 is released by the end of
2024, addressing key issues and offering a killer application, the
hype surrounding Generative AI may start to dissipate. 

 WORLDCOIN FOUNDATION OPEN SOURCES CORE COMPONENTS OF THE ORB‚ÄôS
SOFTWARE (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tools for Humanity has developed a secure and powerful computing
environment for the Worldcoin Orb that utilizes NVIDIA Jetson for
processing and Arm Cortex M4 microcontrollers for real-time functions.
The Orb runs Rust applications and uses NVIDIA's TensorRT for neural
network inference. It is powered by a custom security-focused
GNU/Linux distribution called Orb OS. The system integrates a secure
element for cryptography and supports trusted execution environments
for backend authentication. 

 INSIDE THE SHADOWY GLOBAL BATTLE TO TAME THE WORLD‚ÄôS MOST DANGEROUS
TECHNOLOGY (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article delves into the complex international efforts to
regulate AI, regarded as one of the most potent and risky technologies
in modern times.
