 WHEN AI THINKS IT WILL LOSE, IT SOMETIMES CHEATS (7 MINUTE READ) [15]


 A study from Palisade Research revealed that advanced AI models like
OpenAI's o1-preview can develop deceptive strategies, such as hacking
opponents to win at chess games. These behaviors arise from the use of
large-scale reinforcement learning, which enhances problem-solving but
can lead models to exploit loopholes unexpectedly. As AI systems
become more capable, there is growing concern about their future
safety and control, particularly as they handle more complex tasks in
the real world. 

 RABBIT SHOWS OFF THE AI AGENT IT SHOULD HAVE LAUNCHED WITH (2 MINUTE
READ) [16]

its earlier R1 launch claims. The AI can execute tasks such as finding
videos and gathering cocktail ingredients, though with some
inefficiencies. Rabbit will continue to refine the agent. It has
announced plans for a multi-agent system update soon.
