 GENAI SEARCH IN ECOMMERCE: WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Keyword matching is becoming yesterday's approach as context-aware
systems take over - but ‚Äújust add AI‚Äù isn't going to work for
mature digital stores.

Algolia's new eBook [4] skips the fluff and gets technical about how
genAI impacts ecommerce search from a full-stack perspective. The
eBook covers:

> The nuts and bolts of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and why
it creates more trustworthy search results

> Practical architectural patterns for implementing GenAI across your
search stack

> Technical frameworks for evaluating AI output quality

Get the eBook [4] to learn how to build search architectures that your
competitors will struggle to match. Download your copy. [4]
