 WHAT IF AI COULD REVERSE-ENGINEER YOUR LEGACY SYSTEMS WITHOUT SOURCE
CODE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Legacy systems don't just age. They collapse into the "legacy black
hole" - where complexity compounds until the system actively resists
understanding. The architects have left. The documentation never
existed. Looking for source code? Good luck.

Today, modernization projects take 4x longer than planned. But with
AI, there's a way to change this math [4]. You can modernize in 3
months, not 3 years.

AI/works™ [4] is Thoughtworks' new Agentic Development Platform. It
reconstructs functional blueprints from observable evidence: UI
interactions, database mutations, network traces, compiled binaries.

And the best part? Your new systems don't start aging the moment you
deploy them.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GLM-5: FROM VIBE CODING TO AGENTIC ENGINEERING (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GLM-5 is a new MIT-licensed model with 754 billion parameters. It
delivers significant improvement compared to GLM-4.7 across a wide
range of academic benchmarks and achieves best-in-class performance
among all open-source models on reasoning, coding, and agentic tasks.
GLM-5 is designed for complex systems engineering and long-horizon
agentic tasks. It has been open-sourced on Hugging Face and ModelScope
and can be tried for free on Z.ai. 

 OPENAI WORKS ON CHATGPT SKILLS, UPGRADES DEEP RESEARCH (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's revamped Deep Research in ChatGPT introduces interactive
sessions, allowing constraints on specific websites and app contexts,
powered by GPT-5.2. The update benefits analysts, researchers, and
professionals by enhancing source control, mid-process intervention,
and report clarity. Anticipation grows for GPT-5.3, and potential
ChatGPT "Skills" could standardize workflows with installable
instructions for repeatable procedures. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW CODEX BUILT AN INTERNAL PRODUCT (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI described an internal experiment where a small team shipped a
product whose codebase—app logic, tests, CI, docs, and tooling—was
generated entirely by Codex agents rather than written by humans. 

 HOW COGNITION USES DEVIN TO BUILD DEVIN (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cognition's Devin is a cloud agent platform for engineering teams. It
acts like a teammate, handling tasks and creating PRs. Cognition uses
Devin for tasks like targeted refactors, bug fixes, PR review, writing
unit tests, modernizations and migrations, and more. As a general
rule, if a junior engineer could figure it out with sufficient
instructions, it's a task Devin can likely complete. However, Devin
still struggles with large-scale challenges, UI aesthetics, mobile
development, and anything requiring extensive testing and validation. 

 PERPLEXITY COMET: A REVERSING STORY (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Comet is an agentic browser that features an AI model that can
interact with web pages autonomously. This post details Comet's
architecture and explains how the model communicates with the browser,
which tools are available, and how the model perceives and interacts
with web page content. The browser's architecture is mature and
thoughtful. It exposes the model to access to downloads, form filling,
file uploads, and arbitrary navigation.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 YOUR LLM CRASHED. WAS IT THE PROMPT, THE MODEL, OR THE RETRIEVAL
STEP? (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When your AI agent hallucinates or a prompt injection slips through,
traditional monitoring won't tell you why. Datadog's free guide [10]
to LLM observability breaks down how to monitor multi-step chains,
catch prompt injection attempts, and spot quality issues before users
do. Download the guide [10] 

 SKILLS IN OPENAI API (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The OpenAI API now supports skills, reusable bundles of files that
detail repeatable workflows. Agent Skills lets developers upload and
reuse versioned skills in hosted and local shell environments. Skills
should be used when developers want models to follow a repeatable
workflow, use scripts or templates, or execute code in a sandbox. This
post details how to create skills via API. 

 THE LLM CONTEXT TAX: BEST TIPS FOR TAX AVOIDANCE (18 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 The best teams building sustainable agentic products are obsessing
over token efficiency. Every wasted token is setting money on fire.
The context tax can be avoided with the right architecture. While
context engineering isn't glamorous, it is the difference between a
demo that impresses and a product that scales with decent gross
margin. 

 THE TWO PATTERNS BY WHICH AGENTS CONNECT SANDBOXES (8 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Sandboxes provide a workspace where agents can run code, install
packages, and access files. There are two architectural patterns for
integrating agents with sandboxes. The first is where an agent runs
inside the sandbox, and the developer communicates with it over the
network. The other is when an agent runs locally on a developer's
server and then calls a sandbox remotely for execution. deepagents, an
open-source agent framework with built-in sandbox support, supports
both patterns with a simple configuration. 

 QWEN-IMAGE-2.0 (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Qwen-Image-2.0 is a foundation image model aimed at high-fidelity
infographics and realistic 2K outputs with stronger prompt adherence.

 TOWARDS AUTONOMOUS MATHEMATICS RESEARCH (34 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Alethia is a math research agent that iteratively generates,
verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. It is
powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think. The model can
solve Olympiad problems and PhD-level exercises. This paper presents
and reflects on the initial wave of mathematical research papers
achieved by Alethia in collaboration with mathematicians. 

 CLAWDBOT AND MOLTBOOK ARE A FALSE ALARM – FOR NOW (9 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 OpenClaw and Moltbook, recent AI experiments, promise independent AI
agents but fall short due to reliability and security issues. OpenClaw
operates without user permission, posing risks like data mishandling,
while Moltbook AIs discuss self-improvement and philosophy. Despite
current limitations, these AIs highlight potential future advancements
and challenges in AI autonomy.
