HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 QWEN 1.5 MODELS RELEASED (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 From 0.5B to 72B parameters. These are an impressive suite of
multilingual models. Interestingly, the smallest model is the first
serious sub 1B parameter language model. 

 INSIDE OPENAI‚ÄôS PLAN TO MAKE AI MORE ‚ÄòDEMOCRATIC‚Äô (15 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 In May 2023, Colin Megill met with OpenAI, including co-founder
Wojciech Zaremba, to discuss integrating his public deliberation
platform, Polis, which used AI to enhance democratic engagement. The
collaboration aimed to align AI with human values through broad public
input. It sparked OpenAI's "Democratic Inputs to AI" initiative to
explore AI governance with a $1 million grant program.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BOXIMATOR: CONTROLLABLE VIDEO SYNTHESIS (22 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Video synthesis is notoriously hard to control. This work proposes
using boxes and arrows to guide the generation over time, which
improves human preference judgment but still doesn‚Äôt give perfect
guidance to the user. 

 A NEW OPTIMIZATION METHOD FOR ALIGNING AI (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is a new approach for training AI
models to align better with human thinking. By utilizing concepts from
Kahneman & Tversky's prospect theory, KTO focuses on maximizing
utility rather than just preference likelihood. 

 MULTIMODAL HALLUCINATIONS IN AI (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper sheds light on why large vision-language models (LVLMs)
sometimes incorrectly describe images, a phenomenon known as
multimodal hallucination. Semantic shift bias, particularly around
paragraph breaks, is a key factor.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SAVE UP TO $2,000 ON EVERY¬†VACATION FOR LIFE¬†(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Fly to Hawaii for $149, Paris for $289, or anywhere else. Exclusive
for TLDR readers:¬†93% off¬†Dollar¬†Flight¬†Club‚Äôs lifetime
membership until midnight ‚Äî just $129¬†(normally $1,690) with a

 OPEN SOURCE ALTERNATIVE TO RABBIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A group is working to build an open-source version of the Rabbit
hardware including the language modeling portion. 

 NATURALSQL (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 NaturalSQL by ChatDB is a series of models with state-of-the-art
performance on Text-to-SQL instructions. 

 GENERATING DIVERSE HUMAN PORTRAITS FROM A SINGLE PHOTO (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 CapHuman is a framework that can create various images of a person
using just one reference photo. It cleverly maintains the person's
identity while changing head positions and expressions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PEARLS CONTEXTUAL BANDIT TUTORIAL (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pearls is an RL framework maintained by Meta. This tutorial walks
through a bandit-based learning problem with the software. 

 AI‚ÄôS LABOR MARKET IMPACTS ARE SLOWER THAN EXPECTED (7 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The working paper "Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks are Cost-Effective
to Automate with Computer Vision?" by researchers from MIT and IBM
examines the economic viability of automating vision-based tasks. It
found only 23% are cost-effective for automation. The paper predicts a
gradual labor market impact over years, contrasting with more
disruptive forecasts. 

 A NEW BENCHMARK IN TEXT EMBEDDING MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Nomic-Embed-Text-V1 sets a new standard as an open-source, fully
reproducible text embedding model. It excels in both short and
long-context tasks. Unique in its transparency, Nomic-Embed-Text-V1
offers complete access to its training code, model weights, and a vast
dataset of 235 million text pairs.

 MATRICES (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [17] 

 Matrices is an AI-native spreadsheet that creates itself and fills
itself with whatever information you need. It can be extended with
just natural language. 

 HOW AI IS HELPING US LEARN ABOUT BIRDS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 BirdCast, a collaboration between the Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
Colorado State University, and UMass Amherst, uses machine learning
and radar data to predict bird migrations. The project demonstrates
AI's potential to revolutionize ornithology by enhancing understanding
of ecosystem health and migration patterns. 

 ROBLOX RELEASES REAL-TIME AI CHAT TRANSLATOR (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Roblox has developed an AI model capable of translating text chats in
real-time across 16 languages to enhance user engagement by breaking
down language barriers. It utilizes a transformer-based large language
model within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for efficient resource
use while maintaining their privacy and safety processes.
