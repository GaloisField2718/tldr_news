The AI revolution has already begun to rewire Wall St. Using it, a
Harvard data scientist and his crack team have allowed everyday people
to now benefit from a previously ‚Äúoff-limits‚Äù investment.¬†
The company that makes it possible is called Masterworks, whose unique
investment platform enables savvy investors to invest in blue-chip art
for a fraction of the cost. Their proprietary database of art market
returns provides an unrivaled quantitative edge

in analyzing the art market.¬†

So far, it's been right on the money. With all 15 of its exits,
Masterworks has achieved a profit, delivering +17.8%, +21.5%, and
+35.0%

THE AI RULES THAT US POLICYMAKERS ARE CONSIDERING, EXPLAINED (19
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23775650/ai-regulation-openai-gpt-anthropic-midjourney-stable?utm_source=tldrai]

The US government is getting serious about regulating AI, with
proposals focused on new rules, oversight institutions, funding for
research, and expanding the expert workforce. However, the area
remains slippery as the technology rapidly evolves. Key players like
OpenAI and Microsoft have endorsed new government licensing and
auditing for advanced AI models, but the specifics remain contested.

A LIGHTWEIGHT RGB-D SEGMENTATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06024v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Efficient RGB-D semantic segmentation helps mobile robots understand
their environment. While depth data offers useful geometric insights,
it can be noisy. This paper introduces a streamlined network that uses
less computing power but remains robust, blending color and depth
features effectively. 

BRIDGING THE GAP IN 3D DETECTION ACROSS DIFFERENT LIDAR ENVIRONMENTS
(GITHUB REPO) [https://github.com/darrenjkt/ms3d?utm_source=tldrai]

3D detectors often fail when used in unfamiliar settings, causing a
huge drop in detection rates due to changes in tools, places, or
weather. This project proposes a self-training system that adapts to
different lidar types by creating accurate fake labels, MS3D++. 

EFFICIENT MULTI-TASK MODEL SELECTION (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06262v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Predicting the performance of pre-trained neural networks on multiple
tasks without fine-tuning them is a challenge. The traditional method
is computationally costly, while modern methods are limited to single
tasks. This paper introduces EMMS, which transforms varied task labels
into a unified format, allowing for the prediction of a model's
effectiveness across tasks efficiently.

THE POWER OF SYNTHETIC IMAGE GENERATION IN COMPUTER VISION (4 MINUTE
READ) [https://weijiawu.github.io/DatasetDM_page/?utm_source=tldrai]

This project introduces a new tool called DatasetDM that can make
endless fake images along with detailed labels, like which part is
which object or how far things are in the image. This is great for
training computer vision systems, and by using just a small set of
real photos, the synthetic ones help achieve top results in tasks like
identifying objects or editing images.
