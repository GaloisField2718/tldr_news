HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MIDJOURNEY SAYS IT'S ‚ÄòGETTING INTO HARDWARE' (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Midjourney is expanding into hardware with a new team based in San
Francisco. The move, hinted at by the hiring of ex-Neuralink and Apple
Vision Pro engineer Ahmad Abbas, suggests that the hardware could be
related to its ongoing development of AI models for video and 3D
generation. 

 GOOGLE ROLLS OUT GEMS AND IMAGEN 3 TO GEMINI ADVANCED (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Google is rolling out its new features, Gems and Imagen 3, to Gemini
Advanced subscribers. Gems allows users to create custom versions of
Gemini tailored to specific tasks, offering premade options like
learning coaches and coding partners, while Imagen 3 is Google's
latest image generation model, now available to generate detailed and
artistic images. 

 OPENAI IN TALKS FOR FUNDING ROUND VALUING IT ABOVE $100B (3 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 OpenAI is in discussions to raise several billion dollars in a new
funding round led by Thrive Capital that would value the company above
$100 billion, with Microsoft also expected to participate.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GENERATIVE VERIFIERS: REWARD MODELING AS NEXT-TOKEN PREDICTION (28
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Reward models are generally trained as discriminative classifiers.
This work from DeepMind uses a language model's logits for yes/no as
the reward signal. It found that by allowing a model to use CoT and
ensembling, researchers improved performance by 16%. 

 MULTILINGUAL ARBITRAGE (31 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cohere's Aya model was able to dramatically improve its win rate vs
baseline models by taking advantage of the difference between oracle
model performance and routing synthetic data generation. 

 INTRODUCING TABLE-AUGMENTED GENERATION (24 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Table-Augmented Generation is a new paradigm that combines language
models with databases to answer complex natural language questions.

 üí°HOW TO GIVE LLMS HUMAN-LIKE EVALUATION POWERS (SPONSOR) [14] 

 How do you know if your LLM output is any good? Human feedback is the
gold standard ‚Äî but it's expensive, slow, and inconsistent. This
webinar by Kolena [14] introduces cutting-edge techniques to fine-tune
LLMs according to the preferences of human raters. Join the live
session next Wednesday (September 4) for the best experience ‚Üí [14] 

 FAST AND HIGH-QUALITY 3D SHAPE GENERATION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS
(GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 OctFusion is a method for generating 3D shapes with diffusion models
that achieves both efficiency and high quality. It can produce 3D
shapes at arbitrary resolutions in just 2.5 seconds on a single Nvidia
4090 GPU. 

 DISTILLING TRANSFORMERS INTO EFFICIENT LINEAR RNNS (GITHUB REPO) [16]


 Researchers have demonstrated that large Transformer models can be
distilled into more deployment-friendly linear RNNs, reusing weights
from attention layers. 

 EVENT-GUIDED VIDEO DEBLURRING (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers have developed a new approach to video deblurring by
integrating an event camera, which captures motion with microsecond
temporal resolution, to enhance the clarity of motion-blurred videos.

MISCELLANEOUS

 REAL TIME ON DEVICE AI (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cartesian has announced a number of model and system improvements. It
has also released an open hybrid State space model. 

 STEPHEN WOLFRAM THINKS WE NEED PHILOSOPHERS WORKING ON BIG QUESTIONS
AROUND AI (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Stephen Wolfram emphasizes the importance of incorporating
philosophical rigor into AI research, addressing core ethical
questions. As AI's influence grows, these questions, traditionally
part of philosophy, are increasingly relevant. Wolfram advocates for
deeper, classical philosophical thinking in AI development to better
navigate its implications for humanity. 

 THE TOP AI DEALS IN EUROPE THIS YEAR (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Despite general headwinds for startups, AI ventures continue to
secure substantial funding. U.S. AI startups have achieved nearly 30
deals over $100M in 2024, with Europe not far behind. Major
investments include WAYVE ($1B), Mistral AI (~$1B), Helsing ($484M),
Poolside ($400M), DeepL ($320M), H ($220M), and Flo Health ($200M).
