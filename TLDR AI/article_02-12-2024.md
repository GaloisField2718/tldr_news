 LEARN HOW TO DEMONSTRATE SECURE AI PRACTICES WITH ISO 42001 (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 AI is everywhere, but customers need to know that you're using it
safely and responsibly. The ISO 42001 standard [4] helps companies
demonstrate their AI security practices in a verifiable way.

Watch as experts from Vanta and A-LIGN discuss ISO 42001 [4]—what it
is, what types of organizations need it, and how it works. The
conversation also covers practical strategies and best practices for
successfully integrating ISO 42001 into your organization.

 ELON MUSK SEEKS TO BLOCK OPENAI'S FOR-PROFIT CONVERSION AGAIN (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk's legal team has filed a motion to prevent OpenAI from
transitioning to a for-profit model citing alleged antitrust
violations and financial risks. The motion claims CEO Sam Altman's
actions could leave the company unable to pay damages if Musk wins his
lawsuit. 

 PERPLEXITY MULLS GETTING INTO HARDWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Perplexity's CEO plans to develop a "simple, under $50" AI device for
voice-to-voice interactions. This aligns with a broader trend of AI
startups exploring hardware to enable new interactions, although
historical challenges in AI hardware highlight risks. Perplexity, with
substantial funding, aims to avoid pitfalls faced by others like
Humane's Ai Pin. 

 INFLECTION AI CEO SAYS IT'S DONE TRYING TO MAKE NEXT-GENERATION AI
MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Inflection AI shifted its focus from developing cutting-edge AI
models to providing AI tools for enterprise customers, leveraging
current AI models. It has acquired three AI startups to strengthen
offerings and is open to licensing models from former competitors. CEO
Sean White says the company is focused on practical applications over
frontier model development, highlighting on-premise AI solutions for
enterprise data security.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 INTELLECT-1 RELEASE: THE FIRST GLOBALLY TRAINED 10B PARAMETER MODEL
(12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 INTELLECT-1 is a 10B parameter model trained on 1T tokens with
hardware distributed around the globe. The benchmarks are reasonable,
and the MFU of 30%+ is amazing given the distributed nature of
training. If the results hold, this is a substantial improvement for
decentralized large model training. 

 DETECT AND LEARN UNSEEN OBJECTS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This new framework pushes object detection into open-world scenarios
by teaching AI to identify and learn from objects it hasn't seen
before. 

 MAKING UNDERWATER IMAGES CLEAR (31 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 HUPE is an AI-powered method that improves underwater image clarity
while preserving details critical for other tasks like object
detection.

 ORCHESTRATING AI WORKLOADS ON LAMBDA WITH DSTACK (SPONSOR) [11] 

 If you're managing AI infrastructure, you have better options than
SSH and Kubernetes. Join this technical workshop [11] to see how you
can streamline AI workflows on Lambda using dstack, an open-source AI
container orchestrator — including automated instance provisioning,
and simplified orchestration for environments and model deployments.

 MAPPING THE IONOSPHERE WITH THE POWER OF ANDROID (21 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Google researchers were able to accurately map the Ionosphere by
using GPS fluctuations and some clever algorithmic work. The task is
usually expensive and time consuming. This effort can assist with
various climate solutions. 

 INTRODUCING LTNTORCH (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) merge deep learning with logical
reasoning, allowing neural models to learn by optimizing a knowledge
base of logical formulas. 

 REFINING PRETRAINING DATA PROGRAMMATICALLY (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ProX is a framework that treats data refinement as a programming
task, allowing models to apply fine-grained operations to individual
examples at scale. It improves the quality of pre-training corpora by
using small language models to generate programs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHATS WITH VIDEOS IN REAL TIME (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 MMDuet is a novel "video-text duet" interaction format for VideoLLMs
that allows AI to provide real-time responses as videos play. The
approach mimics a dialogue where both users and AI can exchange
messages during playback. 

 BUILDING LLMS IS PROBABLY NOT GOING BE A BRILLIANT BUSINESS (11
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLM makers like OpenAI face significant challenges due to industry
structure, notably NVIDIA's pricing power as the key chip supplier and
high buyer price sensitivity and competition. Many AI companies raise
substantial capital but struggle with profitability, similar to
historical tech firms like Netscape. Despite this, the technology
itself may still advance. AI businesses might succeed by leveraging
existing models rather than developing new ones. 

 ROX (41 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new AI-native CRM, Rox, aims to disrupt Salesforce by leveraging
AI's ability to manage unstructured data and integrate with data
warehouses. Rox's strategy focuses on enhancing top sales performers
through AI-powered agents while securing customer data for future AI
developments. Investors have shown confidence with $50M in funding,
betting on Rox as AI capabilities continue to improve.
