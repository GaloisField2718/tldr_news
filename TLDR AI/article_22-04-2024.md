HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 UPDATES FROM GOOGLE DEEPMIND ALIGNMENT RESEARCH (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Following Anthropic, GDM has released some work from its alignment
efforts. The main insightful piece here is using sparse autoencoders
on Gemini Ultra. This is a substantial jump in interpretation size. 

 NVIDIA TO COLLABORATE WITH JAPAN ON THEIR CUTTING-EDGE ABCI-Q QUANTUM
SUPERCOMPUTER (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NVIDIA will power Japan's new quantum supercomputer, ABCI-Q,
alongside Fujitsu, integrating 2,000 NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs and CUDA-Q
platform for quantum-classical computing applications. The project
aims to advance Japan's capabilities in quantum computing and AI. This
collaboration is part of a broader technological partnership between
NVIDIA and Japan. 

 BRAVE SEARCH IS ADOPTING AI TO ANSWER YOUR QUERIES (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Brave Search has revamped its answer engine to include AI-synthesized
responses worldwide, leveraging large language models and trusted data
sources. The upgrade enables automatic or manual AI-enhanced answers
to user queries. Brave acknowledges potential impacts on web
publishers and plans to monitor and address the effects of
AI-generated content on site traffic.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MOVING OBJECT SEGMENTATION (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Segmenting objects across videos is challenging due to temporal
consistency. This work presents the combination of a powerful image
segmentation model and optical flow which combined gives compelling
performance on this task. 

 YOUR LANGUAGE MODEL IS A Q-FUNCTION (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A fairly technical RL paper that shows the theoretical underpinning
of reward models and base models in language. 

 FINE-TUNE LLAMA 3 WITH ORPO (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 While this tune performs worse than Hermes, it is likely due to the
small dataset used. Otherwise, this is a great walkthrough on how to
tune these models to improve desired performance on certain tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 USING AI AUTOMATION IN PROCESS ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOWS (SPONSOR) [11]


 AI is everywhere now. While current buzz around AI is driven by
applications like ChatGPT, AI-powered automation and process
orchestration can play a role in everything ‚Äî from carrying out its
own tasks, to orchestrating human tasks, to driving continuous
improvement. Download this free ebook by Camunda [11] to identify
where AI fits in your hyperautomation tech stack. Get the guide here

 FINEWEB: 15T HIGH QUALITY WEB TOKENS (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [12] 

 The newest Llama 3 models were trained on 15T tokens. This new
dataset contains an extensively deduplicated corpus from common crawl
and results in high quality models. 

 MISTRAL COMMON (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Mistral has released its tokenizer utilities, chat templates, and
more basic tools which it uses internally. 

 TRAINING-FREE CONTEXT EXTENSION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Researchers have developed a way to expand the context window of
embedding models up to 32,000 tokens without additional training using
strategies like position interpolation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TEACHING MODELS TO THINK AHEAD (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article introduces "reasoning tokens" in language models, which
generate additional tokens designed to predict future tokens rather
than the immediate next one, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
think ahead. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in
prediction accuracy, suggesting a potential for more complex reasoning
without explicit step-by-step training. 

 LOOKING FOR AI USE-CASES (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article discusses the transformative potential and current
limitations of generative AI like ChatGPT, noting that while it excels
in tasks like coding and generating drafts, it struggles with complex
tasks that require specific programming. It highlights the need for a
vision that matches AI solutions with practical applications,
emphasizing that identifying and integrating these into daily
workflows remains a significant challenge. 

 A VISUAL GUIDE TO VISION TRANSFORMERS (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A visual guide to Vision Transformers (ViTs), a class of deep
learning models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on
image classification tasks.

QUICK LINKS

 LLAMA 3 IS NOT VERY CENSORED (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The original Llama models had significantly more incorrect refusals.
This brief blog shows some examples that previously failed. 

 GPT-4 CAN EXPLOIT REAL VULNERABILITIES BY READING SECURITY ADVISORIES
(3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers have demonstrated that OpenAI's GPT-4 model can
autonomously exploit security vulnerabilities detailed in CVE
advisories with an 87% success rate, far outperforming other models
and tools like vulnerability scanners. 

 THE CAULDRON VLM DATA (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [20] 

 50 vision/language datasets combined into a single format to allow
for improved training of models.
