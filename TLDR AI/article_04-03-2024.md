HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk, co-founder of OpenAI, is suing the company claiming -
among other things - that GPT-4 constitutes AGI and is no longer
subject to the Microsoft agreement. He also argues for more
transparency and openness. 

 OPENAI WANTS TO MAKE A WALKING, TALKING HUMANOID ROBOT SMARTER (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Humanoid robots could be working alongside human manufacturing
workers in only a few short years. Figure, a prominent company in the
humanoid robot space, recently raised $675 million and struck a new
agreement with OpenAI to develop next-generation AI models for its
robots. The funding, which was reportedly over $150 million more than
the amount Figure had initially sought, will help scale up the
company's AI training, robotic manufacturing, and add on new
engineers, speeding up the company's timeline for making its product
available commercially. OpenAI's technology will help improve Figure's
robots' semantic understanding, making them more useful in work
scenarios.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 HYPERATTENTION: USED IN GEMINI (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 It is widely believed, and unofficially confirmed, that Gemini‚Äôs
amazing 1m+ token context window uses HyperAttention to achieve such
success. 

 WHY DO LEARNING RATES TRANSFER? (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A theoretical paper that attempts to explain the success of MuP
hyperparameter transfer. Its authors find that the largest eigenvalue
of the training loss Hessian is independent of the width and depth of
the network. 

 GPT-4 ONLY SUCCEEDS ON 14% OF AGENT TASKS (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The community is very excited about the potential of Agents to tackle
a variety of digital workloads. However, even the best general-purpose
models struggle to complete tasks where humans succeed 70%+ of the
time. It is becoming clear that we may need specially trained models
for these tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 FINETUNE GEMMA 2.4X FASTER WITH UNSOLTH (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Unsloth is a project that aims to rewrite important kernels for
training and inferencing language models. It has released an example
with code for Google‚Äôs open-source Gemma model. 

 3D GEOMETRIC VISION MADE EASY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project supports constructing 3D representations, in GLB form,
from a loosely related collection of images, meaning you can take a
few pictures of a location and reconstruct it for 3D uses. 

 ENHANCING LATENT SPACE SMOOTHNESS IN TEXT-TO-IMAGE DIFFUSION MODELS
(4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A new approach named Smooth Diffusion addresses the challenge of
latent space smoothness in text-to-image diffusion models. This method
ensures a consistent and gradual change in images in response to minor
adjustments in input. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SURFACE NORMAL ESTIMATION (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 DSNIE is a method that dramatically improves monocular surface normal
estimation which can be used in a number of computer graphics
applications. 

 VISUAL PLACE RECOGNITION (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 CricaVPR introduces a novel approach for improving visual place
recognition by focusing on the relationships between multiple images,
even under different conditions. 

 MAGICLAB'S HUMANOID CAN TOAST MARSHMALLOWS, FOLD CLOTHES, AND DANCE
(6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 MagicLab has unveiled MagicBot, a humanoid robot that can roast
marshmallows and dance. The robot has exceptional balance and
dexterity - it has the capability to execute somersaults. MagicBot has
sub-millimeter positioning accuracy and a load capacity reaching
several kilograms. Videos of the robot in action are available in the
article.
