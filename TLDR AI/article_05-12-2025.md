 THE ACTUALLY-USEFUL GUIDE TO RAG: FROM CHUNKING STRATEGIES TO
PRODUCTION-READY PIPELINES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 RAG sounds simple in theory: retrieve relevant documents, feed them
to an LLM, get grounded answers. In practice, there are dozens of
decisions [4] that determine whether your system actually works.

Algolia's white paper [4] covers the full pipeline, including:

 	* CHUNKING: Why 200-500 word blocks with 10-20% overlap tend to work
best for most use cases
 	* EMBEDDINGS: Batch vs. streaming updates, and when to re-embed your
entire corpus
 	* VECTOR STORES: HNSW vs. IVF+PQ indexing, sharding strategies, and
how to keep retrieval under 50ms
 	* PROMPT ASSEMBLY: Structuring system messages, context blocks, and
token budgets for reliable outputs

The guide includes working code examples using FAISS, LangChain, and
Algolia's search client.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC INTERVIEWER (29 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic Interviewer is a tool that uses AI to conduct and analyze
large-scale interviews to research AI's role in work across different
professions. Initial findings from 1,250 professionals showed optimism
toward AI enhancing productivity while highlighting concerns over job
displacement and security in creative and scientific fields. Anthropic
plans to use this data to improve AI models and influence policy,
collaborating with artists, scientists, and educators to align AI
development with user needs. 

 GOOGLE PARTNERS WITH REPLIT, IN VIBE-CODING PUSH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google Cloud has partnered with AI coding startup Replit to enhance
enterprise vibe-coding using Google models. Replit will use Google
Cloud services to expand its platform, supporting AI coding for
enterprise clients. This collaboration aims to drive Google Cloud
adoption and extend AI reach beyond traditional engineers. 

 GEMINI 3 DEEP THINK IS NOW AVAILABLE IN THE GEMINI APP (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Gemini 3 Deep Think uses parallel reasoning to explore multiple
hypotheses simultaneously, building on the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think
variants that won a gold medal on the International Mathematical
Olympiad.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STATE OF AI (90 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This year was a turning point in the real-world use of large language
models. The field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to
multi-step deliberation inference. The shift up folded so fast that
our understanding of how these models have been used in practice has
lagged behind. This study leverages the OpenRouter platform to analyze
over 100 trillion tokens of real-world AI interactions to see how the
technology is being used in the real world. The way developers and
end-users have been engaging with AI is complex and multifaceted. The
study shows how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better
design and deployment. 

 WE GOT CLAUDE TO FINE-TUNE AN OPEN SOURCE LLM (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hugging Face Skills gives Claude the ability to fine-tune language
models. It can submit jobs to cloud GPUs, monitor progress, and push
finished models to the Hugging Face Hub. This tutorial teaches readers
how it works and how to use it. The tool allows users to train models
from 0.5B to 70B parameters, convert them to GGUF for local
deployment, and run multi-stage pipelines that combine different
techniques. 

 GPT-5.1-CODEX-MAX PROMPTING (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has outlined how to get optimal results from
GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, highlighting its faster token efficiency,
long-running autonomy, and improved compaction for extended reasoning.

 BUILDING WITH CURSOR (PUBLIC) (WEBSITE) [14] 

 This is the public-facing version of an internal onboarding guide at
Cursor. It walks through how to get started from scratch to a
built-out and deployed project. It covers how to set up and use
Cursor, how to build and customize projects, and how to deploy using
Vercel. 

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR AI AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The field of context engineering is moving fast. However, the biggest
performance gains nowadays come from removing complexity. As models
get stronger, we should be getting out of the model's way. Context
engineering is about minding the minimal effective context required
for the next step, not about adding more context. 

 ARCHITECTING EFFICIENT CONTEXT-AWARE MULTI-AGENT FRAMEWORK FOR
PRODUCTION (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The landscape of AI agent development is shifting fast. Organizations
are now deploying sophisticated, autonomous agents to handle
long-horizon tasks. However, this ambition is being bottlenecked by
context. The context stack in Google Agent Development Kit was
developed to support context engineering. The open-source,
multi-agent-native framework is built to make active context
engineering achievable in real systems.

 THE MATH LEGEND WHO JUST LEFT ACADEMIA—FOR AN AI STARTUP RUN BY A
24-YEAR-OLD (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Ken Ono is one of the most prominent mathematicians in the world. He
recently joined Axiom Math to revolutionize math with AI. The company
was founded by one of his former students. He joined because he
couldn't resist the opportunity to put his mark on something other
than a chalkboard. 

 POWER OVERWHELMING (17 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI capex is driving US GDP growth, yet a $1.5 trillion AI revenue
shortfall looms compared to invested capital. OpenAI's infrastructure
spend and emerging AI application revenues like ChatGPT's $20B by 2025
reveal a disconnect between projected and necessary earnings to
justify current investments. The uncertain AI cloud business model,
characterized by rapid hardware obsolescence, suggests heavy reliance
on the Magnificent Seven's internal workloads to prevent an impending
AI bubble and excessive market overbuild.
