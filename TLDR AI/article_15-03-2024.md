 AI IS MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SPAMMERS, HACKERS, AND FRAUDSTERS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Research by Incogni [4] reveals that imposter calls (impersonating a
person, agency, or company) were a major problem in 2023.
AI makes it easier for bad actors to aggregate user information for
robocalls, imposter calls, and other types of fraud [4]. Deep fake
technology is bound to make this worse.

 OPENAI PARTNERS WITH LE MONDE AND PRISA MEDIA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has announced partnerships with Le Monde and Prisa Media
involving the integration of their content into ChatGPT to provide
users with interactive and insightful access to news and to aid in
model training. 

 WORLD‚ÄôS FIRST MAJOR AI ACT PASSED BY EUROPEAN LAWMAKERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The European Parliament has approved the world's first comprehensive
AI regulatory framework, setting global standards for artificial
intelligence, categorizing risks, and aiming for innovation alongside
fundamental rights protection, with staggered implementation starting
in 2025. 

 FIGURE 01 CAN NOW HAVE FULL CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Figure has implemented OpenAI's technology to allow its robots to
have full conversations with people. OpenAI's models provide
high-level visual and language intelligence while Figure's neural
networks deliver fast, low-level dexterous robot actions. This X post
contains a video showing a person talking to a Figure robot and
getting it to perform tasks, explain the reasoning behind the tasks,
and self-assess on how the tasks went.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BRANCH-TRAIN-MIX: MIXING EXPERT LLMS INTO A MIXTURE-OF-EXPERTS LLM
(22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This work shows that you can train models individually and then merge
them together into a single Mixture-of-Experts model. 

 LIVECODEBENCH: HOLISTIC AND CONTAMINATION FREE EVALUATION OF LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CODE (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Evaluating language models trained to code is a challenging task.
Most folks use HumanEval from OpenAI. However, some open models seem
to overfit to this benchmark. LiveCodeBench is a way to measure coding
performance while mitigating contamination concerns. 

 EXPLORING THE SAFETY OF LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers in a recent study used a virtual team called 'Evil
Geniuses' to test the safety of LLMs. They found that these AI agents
are less robust against malicious attacks, provide more complex
responses, and make it harder to detect inappropriate replies.

This library provides tools for reranking documents. It can be
integrated into your retrieval pipeline. 

 SKYVERN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Skyvern automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer
vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual
workflows, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. 

 VISION TRANSFORMERS FOR DENSE PREDICTION TASKS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project introduces ViT-CoMer, a new backbone architecture
enhancing Vision Transformers (ViT) for dense prediction tasks without
the need for pre-training.

for enterprise AI startups at a Lightspeed meetup, emphasizing the
importance of delivering true business value, persistence in hiring,
and prioritizing product quality over cost and speed. Jain also
highlighted the slower adoption of generative AI tools in enterprises
due to privacy and security concerns. Glean aspires to be a ubiquitous
enterprise AI platform, embedding deeply within organizational
workflows to fundamentally change how people work. 

 CLAUDE 3 IS THE MOST HUMAN AI YET (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic's new AI model, Claude 3, stands out for its 'warmth,'
making it a robust partner in creative writing tasks. Claude 3 is
described as more human-feeling and naturalistic, crossing the
threshold from good thought to deep thought made enjoyable. Despite
technical benchmarks not fully capturing this nuance, Claude 3 is
poised to revolutionize how we interact with AI in creative processes.
