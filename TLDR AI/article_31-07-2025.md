TLDR AI 2025-07-31

 SOFTWARE USED TO BE ABOUT FEATURES. WITH AI, IT'S ABOUT REAL VALUE
DELIVERED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When you buy an Office license, you're paying for features or
capabilities. With AI, features and capabilities are nearly unlimited,
and THE VALUE OF SOFTWARE BECOMES WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES. That's why
OpenAI and Anthropic charge by tokens used rather than seats.

The change is inevitable, but many monetization models are stuck in
the past [4]. Read more about the three eras of software value—and
the cost of not keeping up with the current one—on the Metronome
blog [4].

P.S. Later this month, Metronome will release a full whitepaper on
this topic: _The_ _Monetization Operation Model_. Get early access [5]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI HITS $12 BILLION IN ANNUALIZED REVENUE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has reached $12 billion in annualized revenue, roughly
doubling its revenue in the first seven months of the year. The figure
implies that OpenAI is generating $1 billion a month. The company has
around 700 million weekly active users. OpenAI has increased its cash
burn projection to roughly $8 billion in 2025, up $1 billion from its
projection earlier in the year. 

 META'S VISION FOR PERSONAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta is betting on personal superintelligence as the future of
computing: AI that knows you deeply, lives on devices like smart
glasses, and helps you pursue your goals, relationships, and
creativity. Unlike centralized visions of automation and universal
basic output, Meta argues that progress comes from individual agency
and empowerment. The company plans to invest heavily in infrastructure
and safety to bring this technology to billions. 

 AMAZON INVESTS IN ‘NETFLIX OF AI' START-UP FABLE, WHICH LAUNCHES
SHOWRUNNER: A TOOL FOR USER-DIRECTED TV SHOWS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon has invested in Fable, a startup with an AI-generated TV show
service called Showrunner. The money from the investment will help
develop Showrunner, which allows users to create scenes (or entire
episodes) of a TV show using prompts. Showrunner will be free at
launch, but the company eventually plans to charge $10-$20 per month
for credits. Fable's AI models have guardrails that block offensive,
illegal, or copyrighted material. 

 MISTRAL CODESTRAL 25.08 AND THE ENTERPRISE CODING STACK (9 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Mistral unveiled Codestral 25.08, part of a full-stack coding
platform optimized for enterprise needs. It addresses deployment,
customization, observability, and toolchain integration gaps to enable
AI-native software development across regulated and complex
environments.

 QUERY FAN-OUT TECHNIQUE IN AI MODE: NEW DETAILS FROM GOOGLE (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google's query fan-out technique, available in AI Mode, Deep Search,
and some AI Overview experiences, makes multiple background searches
based on an initial question. It uses a large language model to
interpret queries and 'fan out' to multiple related searches,
including on topics the user never explicitly mentioned. The responses
are then combined into a single response with links. 

 30% OF "HUMANITY'S LAST EXAM" ANSWERS ARE LIKELY WRONG (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 FutureHouse researchers found that nearly a third of biology and
chemistry questions in the prominent PhD-level AI benchmark contain
answers directly contradicted by peer-reviewed literature. The errors
stem from HLE's unusual design that created "gotcha" puzzles that even
confused human experts. 

 PRICING AI PROOFS-OF-CONCEPT: FREE PILOTS WILL KILL YOU (6 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 AI agents deliver real business value, so they should be priced
accordingly from day one. Companies that position their products as
pilots or technical proof-of-concepts are competing on features
instead of outcomes. They should charge enough to filter out the
curious and co-create the ROI model that closes the deal. Customers
who see how agents help save time, reduce errors, and increase
throughput won't be able to argue with the business value.

 HOW PERPLEXITY, NOTION & THE FARMER'S DOG USE AI TO STAY CLOSE TO
CUSTOMERS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 You're sitting on a goldmine of feedback: tickets, surveys, reviews,
but can't mine it.

Manual tagging doesn't scale, and insights fall through the cracks.

Enterpret's AI unifies all feedback, auto‑tags themes, and ties them
to revenue/CSAT, surfacing what matters to customers.

The result: faster decisions, clearer priorities, and stronger
retention.

 AGENT INTERACTION GUIDELINES (AIG) (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Agents are reshaping roles and workflows, changing how software is
planned, built, reviewed, and deployed. Developer's roles have shifted
to orchestrating input and reviewing output. The Agent Interaction
Guidelines are a set of foundational, evolving principles and
practices for designing agent interactions that integrate naturally
into human workflows. They are still being written, and more is
expected to be added as the community gains more experience. 

 GEPA: REFLECTIVE PROMPT EVOLUTION CAN OUTPERFORM REINFORCEMENT
LEARNING (31 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Traditional RL approaches need thousands of expensive trial-and-error
runs to learn from simple success/failure scores. GEPA uses natural
language reflection to diagnose what went wrong and evolve better
prompts through a Pareto-based selection strategy. GEPA
(Genetic-Pareto) dramatically outperforms both reinforcement learning
methods like GRPO and leading prompt optimizer MIPROv2 while requiring
up to 35× fewer training attempts. 

 LATTE: DECENTRALIZED TEST-TIME ADAPTATION (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Latte is a framework for test-time adaptation in decentralized
environments using pre-trained vision-language models. It combines
local and shared memory to improve adaptation under limited data
conditions.

 SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME UNDENIABLE THIS MONTH (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The best available open weight models new come from Chinese AI labs.
The delay in the release of OpenAI's open weights model may be due to
a desire to be notably better than the truly impressive lineup of
Chinese models. This post lists the biggest Chinese model releases of
this month, along with links to notes on each one. 

 ‘VIRTUAL SCIENTISTS' TO SOLVE COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Stanford Medicine developed a team of AI agents that mimic real
research labs, complete with a virtual PI, specialized scientists, and
a built-in critic. The system has already designed promising COVID-19
nanobodies in days that outperformed existing antibodies in lab tests.


 GOOGLE EARTH AI (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Google introduced Google Earth AI, a suite of geospatial AI models
and datasets designed to tackle major planetary challenges. It
includes models for weather prediction, flood forecasting, wildfire
detection, and urban planning.

 MICROSOFT IN ADVANCED TALKS FOR CONTINUED ACCESS TO OPENAI TECH (3
MINUTE READ) [22]
