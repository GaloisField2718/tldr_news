use employee conversations for model training. 

 OPENAI VALUED AT $80 BILLION IN DEAL WITH THRIVE CAPITAL (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has reportedly reached a valuation of over $80 billion
following a deal with VC firm Thrive Capital. This valuation marks a
nearly 3x increase in less than 10 months, making OpenAI the 3rd
highest-valued tech startup in the world. The deal involves a share
sale under a "tender offer," allowing employees to cash out their
shares in the company. 

 MAGIC RAISES $117M TO CONTINUE CODE GENERATION MODELS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Magic is building an AI software engineer and has raised more to help
with this process.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 KV QUANT - SCALING TO 10M TOKENS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Quantizing the KV cache, which is a technical detail of the
Transformer architecture, allows it to use less memory at inference
time. Quantization is the shrinking of the floating point precision
with minimal loss in quality. 

 ENHANCED SPEECH TRANSLATION (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ZeroSwot is a new method for Speech Translation (ST) that overcomes
the lack of data and differences between speech and text. It uses
unique techniques to train a speech encoder with only speech
recognition data, allowing it to work with a multilingual translation
model. 

 MAKING CLIP‚ÄôS VISUALLY UNDERSTANDABLE (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SpLiCE is a new method that makes CLIP's complex visual data easier
to understand.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TAKE THE¬†PROJECT MANAGEMENT¬†OUT OF PRODUCT BUILDING (SPONSOR) [11] 

 When you started building a product, you didn‚Äôt dream of endless
admin and organization tasks. You wanted to make something people
would love.
Meet Height [11], an AI project tool to manage the work for you,
invisibly, automatically, and autonomously.

 LIBRARY FOR CONTROLVECTORS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ControlVectors are a way to cheaply steer semantic generation output.
They are cheaper to train than LoRA but can still be quite effective.
This library makes it easier. 

 OPENRLHF (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This is a Ray-based implementation of RLHF for Llama-style models,
which includes Mistral. It contains a number of PPO stabilization
tricks to improve performance. 

 3D DIFFUSER FOR SMARTER ROBOTS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The 3D Diffuser Actor combines diffusion policies and 3D scene
representations to improve robot manipulation. This AI-driven approach
allows robots to understand and interact with their environment more
effectively.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO JOINTLY TUNE LR AND WD IN ADAMW (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AdamW is commonly used to decouple learning rate and weight decay.
However, the common implementation in Pytorch doesn‚Äôt explicitly do
this. This post discusses how to tune these parameters. 

 INSIDE OPENAI (68 MINUTE PODCAST) [16] 

 Ever wondered how OpenAI is able to innovate and build at such a fast
pace? In this podcast, Logan Kilpatrick, OpenAI's head of developer
relations, discusses OpenAI's unique culture, the importance of high
agency and urgency, and the company's decision-making framework for
launching products. 

 ENHANCING DENSE VIDEO ANALYSIS TRANSFORMERS (28 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new Temporal Dilated Video Transformer (TDViT) has been developed
to improve the analysis of dense video tasks, such as frame-by-frame
video object detection.
