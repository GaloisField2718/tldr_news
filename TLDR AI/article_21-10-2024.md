 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN FROM HOURS TO MINUTES WITH AUTOMATED
TESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf.

They get engineering teams to 80% automated end-to-end test coverage
[4] and helps them SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles from hours to
minutes.

QA Wolf [4] takes testing off your plate. They can get you:

 	* Unlimited parallel test runs
 	* 24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation
 	* Human-verified bug reports sent directly to your team
 	* Zero flakes, guaranteed

The result? Drata's team of 80+ engineers [5] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META'S LATEST OPEN SOURCE RELEASES (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has released a large number of important and useful research
artifacts including a speech-to-speech model, improved SAM, and many
other interesting advances. 

 ANTHROPIC JUST MADE IT HARDER FOR AI TO GO ROGUE WITH ITS UPDATED
SAFETY POLICY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic updated its Responsible Scaling Policy to include
Capability Thresholds for AI models that pose significant risks, such
as bioweapons and autonomous AI research. This policy aims to set
industry standards by introducing AI Safety Levels that require
stricter safeguards based on model capabilities. By publicly
disclosing safety practices and maintaining a Responsible Scaling
Officer, Anthropic hopes to lead in AI governance and inspire similar
approaches industry-wide. 

 SAM ALTMAN'S WORLDCOIN BECOMES WORLD AND SHOWS NEW IRIS-SCANNING ORB
TO PROVE YOUR HUMANITY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The World project, co-founded by Sam Altman, aims to verify human
identity online using iris-scanning technology amidst privacy concerns
and ongoing investigations in the EU. It plans to incorporate human
verification into AI platforms and potentially redistribute
AI-generated wealth through Worldcoins. Recent announcements include a
new blockchain, app, and tools like Deep Face for combating deep
fakes.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SHORTCUT MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Shortcut models are a new class of consistency like models that can
generate continuous signals with very few inference steps. 

 SABOTAGE EVALUATIONS FOR FRONTIER MODELS (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic has performed a number of novel evaluations to determine
weaknesses and how to measure misalignment in large and powerful
models. 

 ZERO-SHOT 3D VISUAL GROUNDING (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 VLM-Grounder is a new method for 3D visual grounding that overcomes
the limitations of traditional approaches by using vision-language
models (VLMs) and 2D images.

 NEED SIMPLE-YET-POWERFUL VMS FOR AI/ML? TRY GPU DROPLETS ON
DIGITALOCEAN (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Need serious GPU power? Prefer not to spend your entire day fiddling
with infrastructure knobs? DigitalOcean has you covered: GPU Droplets
are virtual machines powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs [12] that make it
easy to run AI workloads (training, inference) without blowing your
budget. 1X and 8X configurations available. See how easy it is to
start [12] 

 DEEPSEEK'S NATIVELY MULTIMODAL MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 DeepSeek has trained and released a 1.3b powerful model that can
operate on interleaved text and images to both generate and
understand. 

 META'S LINGUA (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Meta has created a simple and research friendly codebase that can
reproduce Llama 2 7B in 24 hours. 

 ALIGNING TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS WITH HUMAN VALUES (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization) is a novel method for aligning
Text-to-Image models with human values.

 LONG CONTEXT CONTEST (KAGGLE COMPETITION) [16] 

 The Gemini team has earmarked $100k for the best uses of their long
context model capabilities. 

 ALPHACODIUM OUTPERFORMS DIRECT PROMPTING OF O1 MODEL (10 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 OpenAI's o1 model, which exhibits System 1.5 thinking, shows enhanced
reasoning capabilities compared to previous LLMs but still falls short
of full System 2 deliberate problem-solving. AlphaCodium significantly
improves o1's coding performance by providing a structured framework
that guides reasoning and iterative refinement, achieving better
accuracy on Codeforces benchmarks. While o1 and AlphaCodium together
show promise in advancing AI toward deeper reasoning, much work
remains to integrate full System 2 thinking in AI models. 

 DUOLINGO CEO LUIS VON AHN THINKS AI HAS A LOT TO TEACH US (65 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Duolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, discusses leveraging AI and
gamification to enhance language learning through features like chat
conversations with AI avatars and video game-like adventures generated
by AI. The company recently introduced Duolingo Max, a higher-priced
subscription plan that offers AI-driven conversation practice, as
AI-generated content costs less and speeds up development. Despite
AI's limitations in engagement, Duolingo focuses on keeping users
motivated by balancing learning efficacy with gamified, entertaining
experiences.
