HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META DROPS AI BOMBSHELL: MULTI-TOKEN PREDICTION MODELS NOW OPEN FOR
RESEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta has released pre-trained models that leverage a novel
multi-token prediction approach that forecasts multiple future words
simultaneously, promising enhanced performance and drastically reduced
training times. 

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND'S AI RAT BRAINS COULD MAKE ROBOTS SCURRY LIKE THE
REAL THING (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 DeepMind and Harvard University developed a virtual rat with AI
neural networks trained on actual rat movements and neural patterns to
probe the brain circuits responsible for complex motor skills. This
bio-inspired AI has the capacity to generalize learned movement skills
to new environments, offering insights into brain function and
advancing robotics. The research demonstrates that digital simulations
can effectively mimic and decode neural activity related to different
behaviors.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SUPER-RESOLUTION FOR ANY SCALE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 AnySR is a new approach to single-image super-resolution (SISR) that
enhances efficiency and scalability. Unlike traditional methods, AnySR
supports the 'Any-Scale, Any-Resource' implementation, reducing
resource needs for smaller scales without additional parameters. 

 3D POSE ESTIMATION FROM VIDEOS (13 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Researchers have developed a new approach to estimating
category-level 3D poses from casual, object-centric videos without
human supervision. 

 RESEARCHERS LEVERAGE SHADOWS TO MODEL 3D SCENES, INCLUDING OBJECTS
BLOCKED FROM VIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PlatoNeRF is an AI technique developed by MIT and Meta researchers
that uses shadows and single-photon lidar to create 3D models of
scenes, including obstructed areas. This method could enhance the
safety of autonomous vehicles and improve AR/VR experiences. PlatoNeRF
outperforms traditional methods and has promising practical
applications with lower-resolution sensors.
