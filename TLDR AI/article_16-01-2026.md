 CHINESE AI DEVELOPERS SAY THEY CAN'T BEAT AMERICA WITHOUT BETTER
CHIPS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Some elite Chinese AI researchers estimate that the country's chances
of catching up to the US are slim in the short run due to a bottleneck
in chips. US rules block the direct sale of Nvidia chips to China.
Chinese companies can rent Nvidia chips in third countries, but this
typically leaves developers with fewer chips and more inconvenience
compared with well-funded competitors in the US. The US recently
unblocked sales of Nvidia's H200 chip to China, but this is not likely
to be a game-changer in helping Chinese companies catch up. 

 MOBILE APPS ON REPLIT (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Replit launched a new AI-powered coding assistant designed to enhance
coding efficiency and collaboration. This tool integrates seamlessly
into its platform, providing real-time code suggestions and
intelligent code completion. It aims to streamline the coding process
for developers and teams.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CLAUDE ECONOMIC INDEX REPORT (51 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic published its January 2026 Economic Index, offering new
data on how Claude is used across geographies and sectors. The report
introduces five metrics to track Claude's economic footprint and
includes the most detailed usage dataset released to date. 

 NVIDIA'S ACHILLES HEEL: INFERENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Benchmark's Eric Vishria shares his email to investors about Nvidia
from 2024. Nvidia's dominance holds in training, but GenAI inference
is emerging as the weak spot. Purpose-built SRAM architectures from
players like Groq and Cerebras deliver order-of-magnitude faster
inference than GPUs, unlocking larger models, lower latency, and new
use cases. As inference becomes a growing share of spend, performance
gaps could shift AI compute winners away from incumbents.

 ON NEURAL SCALING AND THE QUANTA HYPOTHESIS (99 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Humanity started an experiment in scaling up deep neural networks
several years ago. The experiment is on track to be the most expensive
ever attempted, and we don't yet know what the results of the
experiment will be. Despite its importance, there isn't a mature
theory backing the experiment. We don't really know how to think about
what neural networks are doing internally. The number of people
working on such a theory in public is relatively small. 

 GOOGLE'S TRANSLATEGEMMA (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google's TranslateGemma is a set of open machine translation models
built on Gemma 3 and fine-tuned using synthetic and human-translated
data, followed by reinforcement learning with quality-focused reward
models. These models outperform Gemma 3 baselines across 55 language
pairs and retain strong multimodal capabilities. 

 SEQUENCE DISTILLATION FOR EFFICIENT REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 DASD is a distillation pipeline that combines techniques like
temperature-scheduled learning and divergence-aware sampling to train
compact models for reasoning tasks. Its 4B and 30B variants achieve
strong results on coding, math, and science benchmarks. 

 NVIDIA SPEEDS UP AI REASONING WITH FAST-THINKACT (5 MINUTE READ) [13]


 Fast-ThinkAct introduces a vision-language-action framework that
compresses textual reasoning into latent plans, achieving up to 9.3x
faster inference for embodied AI while maintaining high reasoning
performance through action-aligned visual plan distillation.

 HOW SCIENTISTS ARE USING CLAUDE CODE? (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anthropic detailed progress on Claude for Life Sciences and its AI
for Science program, highlighting Claude's expanding role as a
research collaborator. The update showcases Opus 4.5's improvements in
scientific reasoning and new use cases across labs accelerating
discovery through AI-powered experimentation and analysis. 

 AI IS EVERYWHERE, BUT NOWHERE IN RECENT PRODUCTIVITY DATA (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Forrester's J.P. Gownder argues that AI hasn't yet boosted
productivity, similar to how PCs didn't immediately impact
productivity metrics. His research suggests AI could replace 6% of
jobs by 2030, with many companies yet to see tangible ROI from AI
projects. He contrasts AI's slow job-replacement with previous shifts
like outsourcing, highlighting financial decisions rather than direct
AI replacements driving current job losses.
