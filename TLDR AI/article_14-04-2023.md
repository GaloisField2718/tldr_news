HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

BUILDING LLM APPLICATIONS (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Chip Huyen has a wealth of knowledge and a huge amount of insightful
blog posts. This is another in that long line of useful content.
Specifically, there are two insights - it is easy to build something
cool with LLMs and it is exceedingly hard to get that cool thing ready
for production. A lot of the challenge comes from the ambiguity of
natural language, and how to store prompts. There is also a list of
promising use cases. 

AWS BEDROCK (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/announcing-new-tools-for-building-with-generative-ai-on-aws/?utm_source=tldrai]


Amazon has announced a new service for AWS called Bedrock that allows
you to use foundation models from various companies such as anthropic
and stability AI. The idea is to take an open model and bring your
data (just point it to s3). There's been a lot of discussion recently
around data privacy and security, with this service it might be
possible to run the models in your own infra in AWS which is
attractive from a privacy perspective. Amazon also announced two new
models and free access to their code model for individual developers.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DREAMPOSE: FASHION IMAGE-TO-VIDEO SYNTHESIS VIA STABLE DIFFUSION (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dreampose/?utm_source=tldrai]


DreamPose is a diffusion-based image-to-video synthesis model. Given
an input image of a person and pose sequence, DreamPose synthesizes a
photorealistic video of the input person following the pose sequence. 

DATASET FOR ANIMATED KID‚ÄôS DRAWINGS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-dataset-animating-kids-drawings/?utm_source=tldrai]


In 2021, Meta released a cool demo of animating kid‚Äôs drawings with
AI. Now they‚Äôve open sourced the dataset of 100k+ examples,
animation code, pose finding, etc. It seems to be permissively
licensed and useful for those interested in working in the automated
animation space. It‚Äôs also nice to see some extra effort taken to
preserve privacy when filtering the dataset. 

VICUNA: AN OPEN-SOURCE CHATBOT IMPRESSING GPT-4 WITH 90% CHATGPT
QUALITY (5 MINUTE READ) [https://vicuna.lmsys.org/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces Vicuna-13B, an open-source chatbot trained by
fine-tuning LLaMA on user-shared conversations. Vicuna-13B outperforms
other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in over 90% of cases while
achieving a quality of over 90% compared to OpenAI ChatGPT and Google
Bard. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300, and the code and
demo are publicly available for non-commercial use.

VIDEO EDITING WITH VIDSTYLEODE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://cyberiada.github.io/VidStyleODE/?utm_source=tldrai] 

VidStyleODE combines StyleGAN and Neural-ODEs for disentangled video
representation, enabling applications like appearance manipulation,
motion manipulation, image animation, and video
interpolation/extrapolation. 

CONTINUAL DIFFUSION (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://jamessealesmith.github.io/continual-diffusion/?utm_source=tldrai]


Text-to-image diffusion models face catastrophic forgetting when
customizing with sequential concepts, leading to poor image generation
for past concepts. Our proposed C-LoRA method overcomes this issue
with a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation, outperforming
baselines in continual diffusion and setting new state-of-the-art
performance in rehearsal-free continual learning for image
classification. 

ADAPTIVE HUMAN MATTING FOR DYNAMIC VIDEOS (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06018?utm_source=tldrai] 

AdaM, an Adaptive Matting framework for Dynamic Videos, tackles the
limitations of trimap-free methods by simultaneously differentiating
foregrounds from backgrounds and capturing alpha matte details in
diverse, unstructured videos. Utilizing an interconnected
encoder-decoder network and a transformer network, AdaM improves
matting realism and temporal coherence, achieving best-in-class
generalizability for complex real-world videos.

CHROMA‚ÄôS HACKER IN RESIDENCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.trychroma.com/blog/hir-2023?utm_source=tldrai] 

On the tails of a recent fundraise, the vector database startup Chroma
is looking to hire a hacker for 3 months to build cool AI applications
that require long-term memory. Specifically, they hope this hacker can
be mostly self driven and build something powerful! I expect to see
more of these sorts of positions pop up, given the ease of MVP
development on top of language models. 

HOW AI COULD DISRUPT VIDEO GAMING (4 MINUTE READ)

The article examines the potential of AI to disrupt the video gaming
industry, emphasizing how innovations in machine learning and
procedural content generation can transform game development, user
experiences, and the overall economics of the sector. 

THE MOUNTING HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS OF AI (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/generative-ai-is-cool-but-lets-not-forget-its-human-and-environmental-costs/?utm_source=tldrai]


This article makes the argument that while generative AI is an
exciting development, it is crucial to consider its human and
environmental costs, such as increased energy consumption, carbon
emissions, and the risk of eroding creative professions or exploiting
human-generated content.
