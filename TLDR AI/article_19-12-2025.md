 AGENTIC AI ISN'T JUST GENAI WITH EXTRA STEPS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The buzz around agentic AI has reached a fever pitch. But outside of
coding, most implementations are "agent-washing:" a chain of prompts
or a normal workflow with an LLM in the loop.

Algolia's ebook [4] breaks down what agentic AI actually is, how it
differs from gen AI, and where it's headed:

→ Read why Gartner predicts a third of enterprise apps will be
agentic enabled by 2028

→ Discover how agentic AI enhances search [4] by parsing natural
language queries and personalizing results (e.g., answering queries
like "sunglasses from Jack Black's latest movie")

→ Learn what good agentic AI looks like, and what's just vaporware

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S NEW FUNDRAISING ROUND COULD VALUE STARTUP AT AS MUCH AS $830
BILLION (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is in the early stages of a fundraising round that could raise
as much as $100 billion, valuing the startup at as much as $830
billion. It aims to complete the round by the end of the first quarter
at the earliest. It is unclear whether there will be sufficient
investor demand to reach the goal. The round will be one of the
biggest tests OpenAI has faced since the public market's exuberance
for AI spending waned. 

 META IS DEVELOPING NEW AI IMAGE AND VIDEO MODEL CODE-NAMED ‘MANGO'
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is developing a new image and video-focused AI model code-named
Mango. The model is expected to be released in the first half of 2026.
Image generation has proven to be a vital front in the war between the
big AI model companies. It is a primary point of interest for many
users and a particularly sticky feature that keeps them coming back. 

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.2-CODEX (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's new agentic coding model is state-of-the-art on SWE-Bench
Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0 with improved long-horizon work. OpenAI is
launching a trusted access pilot to give vetted cybersecurity
professionals access to future, more powerful models.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 JOHN SCHULMAN ON DEAD ENDS, SCALING RL, AND BUILDING RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS (51 MINUTE VIDEO) [8] 

 John Schulman estimates that with full hindsight, a few talented
people could have built a ChatGPT-3.5-level model in 2018-2019 with a
couple of GPU boxes. He described early OpenAI as a "rag tag" blend of
small exploratory research projects and bigger engineering efforts
inspired by DeepMind's AlphaGo. He expects value functions and offline
RL to make a comeback, and warns that catch-up mode makes it harder to
build exploratory research culture later. 

 AI #147: FLASH FORWARD (93 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GPT-5.2 is a frontier model only for the frontier. OpenAI's image 1.5
looks comparable to Nano Banana Pro, and the startup has a deal for
Disney's characters. Gemini 3 Flash is a good model for its speed and
price. It captures the bulk of Gemini 3 Pro's intelligence quickly at
a low price. 

 EVALUATING CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT MONITORABILITY (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI has proposed a new evaluation suite to measure how reliably
model reasoning can be monitored via chains-of-thought. The study
assessed monitorability across 24 environments and found that
reasoning transparency can vary significantly with scale,
reinforcement learning, and inference-time compute.

 AGENT SKILLS BECOMES AN OPEN STANDARD (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Agent Skills, folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that
give AI agents new capabilities on demand, originated at Anthropic
(which also created MCP) and is now an open format with adoption from
Cursor, GitHub, VS Code, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex CLI. Skills
let teams package domain expertise and workflows into portable,
version-controlled packages that work across different agent products.


 INSIDE REPLIT'S SNAPSHOT ENGINE: THE TECH MAKING AI AGENTS SAFE (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Replit built a compute and storage fabric that allows it to make
changes in an isolated, reversible way. These primitives enable
developers to experiment more frequently and faster. The company
realized the same primitives could be used to superpower coding agents
when it built Replit Agent in 2024. The system helps the human driving
the agent, and the agent itself greatly benefits from the tools. This
post explores the underlying systems that make the Replit Agent safe
and how Replit uses them. It also takes a peek at Replit's near-term
roadmap. 

 INTRODUCING MISTRAL OCR 3 (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mistral OCR 3 is designed to extract text and embedded images from a
wide range of documents with exceptional fidelity. It is a major
upgrade over the previous version in forms, handwritten content,
low-quality scans, and tables. Mistral OCR 3 enables downstream
systems to understand structure as well as document content. The model
can be integrated via API and used with Document AI, a UI that parses
documents into text or structured JSON. 

 RUBRICS AS REWARDS: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BEYOND VERIFIABLE DOMAINS
(15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Scale AI researchers developed a structured approach to reinforcement
learning that uses checklist-style rubrics instead of traditional
preference rankings to train language models on subjective tasks. The
framework achieved up to 28% improvement on medical reasoning
benchmarks by decomposing response quality into interpretable criteria
like factual accuracy and completeness.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NVIDIA AND ALPHABET VC ARMS BACK VIBE CODING STARTUP LOVABLE AT $6.6
BILLION VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Alphabet and Nvidia have invested in Swedish vibe coding startup
Lovable in a $330 million Series B round that places it at a $6.6
billion valuation. Lovable has raised over $500 million this year. The
company has built a product popular with both enterprises and
founders. Its platform uses AI models to help users build apps and
websites using text prompts. 

 THE SIGNATURE FLICKER (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic has fixed Claude Code's signature flicker. Terminals
weren't really designed for interactivity. Repositioning the cursor
and writing over existing text easily leads to flickering if not done
well. Anthropic chose to re-render only the changed parts. It rewrote
the renderer from scratch while still keeping React as the component
model.

 CONTRA DSPY AND GEPA (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Trying to treat LLM workflows as modular programs is a backwards,
rigid, and the wrong fit for the most interesting tasks. 

 SUPERPOWERS 4 (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Superpowers 4.5 has better subagent-driven development. 

 PROJECT VEND: PHASE TWO (8 MINUTE READ) [19]

 2026 VIBE CODING TOOL COMPARISON (20 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Replit is the most feature-rich, well-thought-out, and powerful vibe
coding tool, but v0 is the best if you're already a developer and want
a technical interface. 

 META'S YANN LECUN TARGETS $3.5 BILLION VALUATION FOR NEW AI STARTUP,
