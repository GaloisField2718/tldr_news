 BRIA AI, THE BELLE OF THE BALL FOR VISUAL GENERATIVE AI @NVIDIA GTC
2025! (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Over 20K attendees roamed downtown San Jose for 2025 GTC last week;
AI developers learned from Bria.ai [5] How to build predictable,
controllable, on-brand visual content at scale while respecting
artists' rights.

See a few of the key topics they covered:

 	* The Future of a Sustainable Economy Around Visual Generative AI is
Built on Licensed Data, Not Scraped (a.k.a stolen) Data. [6]
 	* Visual AI Cookbooks (GitHub projects) For Visual Generative AI
Model Customization [7]
 	* Explore All Bria APIs for Content Creation [8]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI AND MIT EXPLORING AI AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 MIT Media Lab and OpenAI are exploring how users engage emotionally
with ChatGPT, examining its impact on social and emotional well-being.
The study highlights the diverse ways people use AI conversational
models and sets the stage for further research on responsible AI
interactions. 

 HUGGING FACE REAL-TIME ENDPOINT ANALYTICS (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hugging Face has revamped its analytics dashboard, which now features
real-time updates for monitoring AI inference endpoints. The improved
system ensures faster data loading and instant insights into request
latency, error rates, and performance metrics. 

 PERPLEXITY'S PLAN FOR REBUILDING TIKTOK IN AMERICA (7 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Perplexity AI envisions a TikTok that prioritizes deep content
discovery and truth-seeking powered by an advanced answer engine. It
plans to enhance the platform's utility while maintaining its core
function as a hub for creative expression.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SYNTHETIC CITIES (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SynCity is a novel system that generates detailed 3D worlds from text
prompts without any training. It combines a 2D image generator for
artistic quality and a 3D generator for accurate geometry, building
scenes tile-by-tile and seamlessly blending them into a navigable
environment. 

 NEMOTRON-H (23 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nvidia has released a new set of hybrid Mamba style models trained on
20T tokens. They achieve strong performance, especially on long
context tasks where they have extreme sequence scaling benefits. This
represents the first successful fp8 large scale training of a hybrid
attention model. 

 LARGE-SCALE OUTDOOR SCENE GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 NuiScene introduces a new method for generating expansive outdoor
environments that utilizes uniform vector-set encoding and explicit
outpainting for better compression and faster generation. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TOKENIZE AN IMAGE AS A SET (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 "Tokenize Image as a Set" is a new framework for image generation
that uses set-based tokenization and a novel discrete diffusion
method. The approach represents images as unordered token sets,
enabling a unique and invertible generative modeling process. 

 LATENT MULTI-HOP REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This research investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
perform multi-hop reasoning – a process of connecting multiple
pieces of knowledge – when presented with complex prompts. The study
found evidence of this latent reasoning process, particularly in the
initial step, but utilization of the connected knowledge varied and
showed a scaling trend with model size, suggesting both challenges and
opportunities for future LLM development. 

 LARGE ANIMATABLE HUMAN RECONSTRUCTION MODEL FOR SINGLE IMAGE TO 3D IN
SECONDS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Code release for a method that takes a single image as input and
creates a fully animatable 3D avatar. It is permissively licensed and
seems to work quite well. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENAI EXEC LEAVES TO FOUND MATERIALS SCIENCE STARTUP (1 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 OpenAI's VP Liam Fedus is leaving to start a materials science AI
company with backing from OpenAI. His new firm will compete with
Google DeepMind and Microsoft in the AI materials science sector. Some
experts doubt current AI can achieve groundbreaking scientific
discoveries. 

 PEOPLE ARE USING GOOGLE'S NEW AI MODEL TO REMOVE WATERMARKS FROM
IMAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google's new Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model can remove watermarks from
images, raising copyright concerns. The tool, available in Google's AI
Studio, is experimental and not suited for production use, yet shows
advanced capabilities in watermark removal. Google states that using
its generative AI tools for copyright infringement violates its terms
of service. 

 APPLE'S AI STRATEGY PLAGUED BY DELAYS, SIRI UPGRADE REMAINS IN LIMBO
(3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Apple is facing delays and challenges with its AI features for Siri,
initially planned for iOS 18.5 but now possibly pushed to 2026.
Despite showcasing features at WWDC, internal assessments reveal the
technology isn't ready for public release yet. Apple remains
optimistic in enhancing Siri, aiming for significant improvements by
2027 with a new infrastructure to stay competitive.
