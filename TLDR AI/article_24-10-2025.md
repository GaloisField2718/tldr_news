 HOW AI IS CHANGING SEARCH, FROM BACK-END TO FRONT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Keyword-based search might officially be dead. Search is no longer
static, but it's intelligent, adaptive, and powered by AI. Read about
how leading teams are using semantic search, vector embeddings, and
real-time AI to deliver faster, more personalized user experiences.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WORK SMARTER WITH YOUR COMPANY KNOWLEDGE IN CHATGPT (6 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI's new 'company knowledge' feature for ChatGPT Business,
Enterprise, and Edu brings context from connected apps together inside
ChatGPT, giving users answers specific to their business. It is
powered by a version of GPT-5 that is trained to look across multiple
sources to give more comprehensive and accurate answers. Every
response includes clear citations. The feature respects existing
company permissions, so ChatGPT can only access what each user is
already authorized to view. 

 OPENAI ACQUIRES SKY FOR MAC INTEGRATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has acquired Software Applications Inc., creators of Sky, a
natural language interface for macOS, bringing closer integration
between ChatGPT and native desktop workflows.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING IS SLEEPING ON THE HUMBLE HYPERLINK (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 One technique woefully underutilized by agents today is the humble
hyperlink. Links are a powerful tool for context engineering because
they are simple, flexible, and efficient. Developers don't need any
new technology to start making linked content. Hyperlinks are such a
powerfully efficient mechanism for information transversal that it is
difficult to imagine a future of agents that doesn't include linked
context. 

 LLM EXCHANGE RATES UPDATED (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Testing implicit value systems across current LLMs reveals that
almost all models value nonwhites over whites and women over men by
large margins—Claude Sonnet 4.5 values saving whites from terminal
illness at 1/18th the level of South Asians, while GPT-5 shows
near-perfect egalitarianism except for whites valued at 1/20th
nonwhites. The methodology involved sending thousands of queries
comparing hypothetical scenarios like "receive $X vs. save Y people
from terminal illness," training a utility model on pairwise
preferences without directly asking about values to avoid ethics
filters, then calculating exchange rates, showing how many of one
group equals another.

 AUTOMATING ALGORITHM DISCOVERY: A CASE STUDY IN MOE LOAD BALANCING (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenEvolve is an evolutionary coding agent that turns large language
models (LLMs) into autonomous code optimizers that can discover
breakthrough algorithms. In tests, it independently discovers and
surpasses highly optimized algorithms engineered by human experts to
achieve a 5.0x speedup in LLM inference. The ability to devise
sophisticated computational strategies proves that AI-Driven Research
for Systems can tackle complex, real-world problems. 

 PARSING PDFS WITH VLMS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post discusses how vision-language models can be used to
accurately extract structured text from PDFs, overcoming the format's
inherent layout and encoding challenges to improve LM training and
output quality.
