HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ERIC SCHMIDT'S AI PROPHECY (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt predicts rapid advancements in AI,
with potential to create significant apps like TikTok competitors in
minutes within the next few years. He highlights the unpredictability
and swift progress in AI, where large language models and agent-based
systems with text-to-action capabilities could converge, causing
tremendous economic and technological disruption. Schmidt's view
reflects the substantial investments and energy requirements
anticipated for leading-edge AI development, signaling a
transformative period ahead. 

 WAYMO IS DEVELOPING A ROOMIER ROBOTAXI WITH LESS-EXPENSIVE TECH (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Waymo has unveiled its Generation 6 self-driving technology, which
requires fewer cameras and sensors, integrated into Geely Zeekr EVs.
The Alphabet unit plans to rapidly deploy this tech, leveraging
machine learning and semiconductor advancements to withstand diverse
weather conditions. This update supports Waymo's scaling efforts for
its Waymo One service, which is currently providing 50,000 weekly
trips. 

 GEMINI LIVE COULD USE SOME MORE REHEARSALS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gemini Live, Google's AI-powered voice interaction system, mimics
natural conversation but struggles with hallucinations and
inaccuracies. Despite incorporating professional actors for more
expressive voices, it lacks the customizability and expressiveness
found in competitors like OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode. Overall, the
bot's reliability issues and limited functionality make its
practicality and purpose unclear, particularly as part of Google's
paid AI Premium Plan.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BLIP-3 (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 BLIP was the dominant multimodal model for some time. The newest
version is dramatically simpler, using a pure autoregressive loss. It
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of captioning
benchmarks. 

 IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH SAM2-UNET (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SAM2-UNet is a new framework for image segmentation that leverages
the powerful Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) as its encoder. 

 A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (38 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This paper provides an extensive review of 180 benchmarks used to
evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models.

 SURFACE-ALIGNED GAUSSIAN SPLATTING FOR EFFICIENT 3D MESH
RECONSTRUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Mesh reconstruction from gaussian splatting allows you to take a
video or image sequence and construct an editable and animatable mesh
output. It does so extremely quickly and efficiently, requiring only a
few steps on a single GPU. 

 LLAMA-3.1 STORM (HUGGING FACE HUB) [13] 

 These are the first tuned models that convincingly improve on the
base Llama-3.1 models from Meta. 

 A LANGUAGE MODEL FOR ENHANCED RECOMMENDATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 EasyRec is a language model designed specifically for recommendation
tasks. It utilizes collaborative information from multiple datasets
and innovative contrastive learning objectives to create high-quality
semantic embeddings. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 CLASSIFYING ALL PDFS ON THE INTERNET (28 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A great article on using embeddings and clever prompting to classify
every available PDF on the internet based on its semantic content. 

 HOW TO GET FROM HIGH SCHOOL MATH TO CUTTING-EDGE ML/AI (17 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Software professionals seeking to understand advanced ML/AI papers
can follow a four-stage learning roadmap: 1) Foundational math
(algebra, calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics), 2)
Classical machine learning (basic regression, classification models),
3) Deep learning (multi-layer neural networks), and 4) Cutting-edge ML
(Transformers, LLMs, diffusion models). Essential resources include
author-created content for stages 1-2 and recommended external
materials for stages 3-4. Mastery of each stage progressively equips
learners to tackle complex ML papers and stay current with evolving AI
research. 

 WHY NEURALINK'S BLINDSIGHT AND BRAIN IMPLANTS TO RESTORE SIGHT WON'T
WORK LIKE HUMAN EYESIGHT (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This research highlights the challenges of restoring vision with
AI-powered cortical implants, emphasizing that neurons in the visual
cortex do not function like pixels on a screen. While high-resolution
simulations show potential, achieving natural vision through cortical
implants requires replicating complex neuronal patterns, a task far
beyond current capabilities, leading to grainy and imperfect outcomes.

 HAMMING LAUNCHES 100X FASTER TESTING OF VOICE AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Hamming is a tool that allows you to set up Character AI-like
personas and test hundreds of scenarios for your voice AI systems. 

 A PERSONALIZED BRAIN PACEMAKER FOR PARKINSON'S (6 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Researchers have developed an adaptive approach to deep brain
stimulation that tailors electrical pulses to Parkinson's patients'
varying symptoms, significantly reducing symptom duration.
