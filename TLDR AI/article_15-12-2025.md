 HOW RAMP BUILT AN AI OPERATING SYSTEM FOR SCALABLE WORK (SPONSOR) [4]


 Learn how Ramp became one of the most productive companies in the
world by adopting a Builder mindset—understanding that work is
fundamentally changing and actively building an AI operating system
instead of waiting for the perfect tool.

Key takeaways from the story:

	* THE BUILDER MINDSET: Don't wait for AI to get easier—start
designing your future work now
	* THREE STEPS TO SCALE: Getting precise with AI, centralizing
information, and building workflows without engineers
	* REAL RESULTS: 270 features shipped in H1 2025 (more than all of
2024 combined) with 90% of 1,200 employees using Notion AI monthly

The blog includes a CTA to watch the Make with Notion session with Ben
Levik (Ramp's operations and AI product leader)

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI IS QUIETLY ADOPTING SKILLS, NOW AVAILABLE IN CHATGPT AND CODEX
CLI (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Skills support is quietly showing up in OpenAI's Codex CLI tool and
ChatGPT. The skills folder can be accessed by prompting, 'Create a zip
file of /home/oai/skills'. So far, the skills cover spreadsheets,
docx, and PDFs. A link to a repository with a copy of the skills is
available in the article. 

 TINKER ADDS VISION INPUT AND GOES GA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Tinker is open to everyone now, featuring a new reasoning model, Kimi
K2 Thinking, and an OpenAI API-compatible interface for seamless
integration. Vision input capabilities have been added with Qwen3-VL
models, allowing processing of images and text together. These updates
enhance Tinker's utility in image classification, outperforming
traditional models with limited labeled data.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 I REVERSE ENGINEERED CLAUDE'S MEMORY SYSTEM, AND HERE'S WHAT I FOUND!
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude uses on-demand tools and selective retrieval for its memory
system. This post explores Claude's memory system through
conversations with the bot. Claude appears to be cooperative,
transparent, and willing to share information about its internal
structure, tools, and prompt format. However, it is worth noting that
Claude can hallucinate, so some of the information may be inaccurate. 

 TEXT DIFFUSION MODELS ARE FASTER AT WRITING CODE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Diffusion language models generate code at a faster rate than large
language models. Increased structure tends to correlate with reduced
entropy, which leads to higher confidence token predictions, which
directly means more tokens decoded in parallel per step. Tests suggest
that it really is the structuredness of the output, not memorization,
that matters. 

 INSIDE OUR EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE MINTLIFY ASSISTANT (3 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Mintlify's AI-powered assistant helps end users get answers from docs
with clear citations and useful code examples. This article walks
through how the team analyzed and improved the assistant after they
decided that it wasn't performing the way they wanted. The team
rebuilt its feedback pipeline, moved conversation data into
ClickHouse, and categorized negative interactions at scale. Its
analysis surfaced that search quality was the assistant's biggest
weakness, while most other responses were strong. 

 CAN LLMS GIVE US AGI IF THEY ARE BAD AT ARITHMETIC? (17 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 While large language models are useful tools, it's hard to look at
the frontier models and see something approximating human-level
intelligence when there are such evident cognitive gaps. These models
aren't being fine-tuned to make accurate judgments about even small
datasets. There needs to be more efficient ways to attach data that
doesn't burn tokens while still allowing models to pass data sets
through to efficient tools. This would make tooling a great deal more
efficient.

 TINKERING WITH PROMPTS CAN ONLY GET YOU SO FAR. (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Most companies get stuck tinkering with prompts and wonder why their
agents fail to deliver dependable results. This guide from You.com
[11] breaks down the evolution of agent management, revealing the five
stages for building a successful AI agent and why most organizations
haven't gotten there yet. 

Go beyond the prompt: get the guide. [11]

 HOW WE USED CODEX TO BUILD SORA FOR ANDROID IN 28 DAYS (15 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The initial version of Sora's production Android app was built in 28
days using OpenAI Codex. It took a lean engineering team and roughly 5
billion tokens to ship the project. The app has a crash-free rate of
99.9%. This article describes how OpenAI used GPT-5.1-Codex - the same
version available to any developer or business - to build the app. 

 AGENTIC CODING TOOLS SHOULD GIVE MORE CONTROL OVER MESSAGE QUEUEING
(7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Claude Code uses boundary-aware queuing, where new messages are
inserted at natural break points, which changes the model's course of
action smoothly without stopping ongoing generation. OpenAI Codex uses
post-turn queuing, where user messages wait until the current action
finishes completely before they are handled. Agentic tools should
implement both types of queuing and let users choose which to use.
Having that option would make a difference in agentic workflows where
users are running three to four agents in parallel. 

 SKILLS VS DYNAMIC MCP LOADOUTS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The easiest way to work with tools is to ask agents to write their
own tools as a skill. This leaves control of the tool largely to the
user. Whenever it breaks or needs modification, the user can just ask
the agent to adjust it. Dynamic tool loading with MCP will likely
become a thing, but it will probably take quite a few protocol changes
to bring in skill-like summaries and built-in manuals for the tools. 

 EVALUATING GEMINI ROBOTICS POLICIES IN A VEO WORLD SIMULATOR (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google used its video generation model Veo to build a world simulator
that predicts how robotics algorithms will perform in novel
environments without physical testing. The system accurately ranked
eight policy checkpoints and identified safety vulnerabilities—like
a robot knocking over a laptop or grabbing a bottle too
aggressively—through 1,600+ simulated rollouts that correlated
strongly with real-world results.

 OPENAI ENDS ‘VESTING CLIFF' FOR NEW EMPLOYEES IN
COMPENSATION-POLICY CHANGE (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has ended a compensation policy that required employees to
work at the company for at least six months before their equity vests.
The change is designed to encourage new employees to take risks
without fear of being let go before accessing their first chunk of
equity. OpenAI had shortened its vesting period for new employees to
six months from the industry standard of 12 months in April. xAI also
made a similar change in the late summer. 

 CLAUDE CODE'S DX IS TOO GOOD, AND THAT'S A PROBLEM (11 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Claude Code's capabilities have grown tremendously. This means that
developers have a lot more to learn. Claude Code is currently
optimizing hard for the power user while trying not to lose everyone
else. While the learning curve is manageable, every new capability
adds weight. The risk is that Claude Code becomes so capable that you
need to learn Claude Code to use it.
