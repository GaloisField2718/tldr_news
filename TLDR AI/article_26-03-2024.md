RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GENERATING REALISTIC SHADOWS IN IMAGES (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This study introduces a new method for creating realistic shadows in
image composition, overcoming previous challenges with shape and
intensity accuracy. The researchers significantly improved shadow
generation in images by enhancing ControlNet with intensity modulation
modules and expanding the DESOBA dataset. 

 PEOPLE RECOGNITION FROM DRONE AND GROUND CAMERAS (14 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Researchers developed the View-Decoupled Transformer (VDT) to tackle
the challenge of identifying people across different camera views,
such as from drones to ground cameras. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH FLEXIBLE SIZES AND ASPECT RATIOS (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 ElasticDiffusion is an innovative decoding method that allows
text-to-image diffusion models to create images in various sizes and
aspect ratios without additional training.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH PSALM (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 PSALM is an extension of the Large Multi-modal Model (LMM), which
introduces a mask decoder and a versatile input schema to excel in
various image segmentation tasks. This approach not only overcomes the
limitations of text-only outputs but also allows the model to
understand and classify complex images effectively. 

 CEREBRAS CS3 CHIP (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cerebras' new wafer chip can train 24T parameter language models. It
natively supports PyTorch. 

 IMPROVED IMAGE PERSONALIZATION (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers have developed a new method to improve how AI creates
personalized images, addressing overfitting issues. This approach
ensures a more balanced and diverse representation of concepts in the
images.

 THE GPT-4 BARRIER HAS FINALLY BEEN BROKEN (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GPT-4's dominance in AI benchmarks has been challenged by four new
models from different vendors, each showing the potential to surpass
GPT-4's capabilities. However, concerns arise as, amidst growing legal
and ethical considerations, none of these models are open-source or
transparent about their training data. The push for models trained on
public domain or licensed content continues, highlighting the
complexity of creating competitive AI without proprietary data. 

 CHINA PUTS TRUST IN AI TO MAINTAIN LARGEST HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK ON
EARTH (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 China's high-speed rail network has seen an 80% decrease in minor
track faults and no major track irregularity warnings in the past year
thanks to AI and machine learning technologies. The success in
proactive safety and maintenance was supported by AI's analysis of
extensive data from the railway's sensors. Despite challenges, such as
a shrinking workforce and U.S. sanctions on AI chips, China continues
to advance in specialized AI applications across various sectors. 

 GO, PYTHON, RUST, AND PRODUCTION AI APPLICATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 This article discusses the role of Python, Go, and Rust in AI
application development: Python for AI model development, Go for
scaled-up production, and Rust for performance-critical tasks. It
suggests that Go could be the production language alternative to
Python, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right language for
the task based on the ecosystem and tool suitability. The author
advocates for bridging Python and Go communities to enhance AI
application production.
