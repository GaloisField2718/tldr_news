 AI STARTUP CURSOR RAISES $2.3 BILLION FUNDING ROUND AT $29.3 BILLION
VALUATION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cursor has closed a $2.3 billion funding round at a $29.3 billion
post-money valuation. The tool has crossed $1 billion in annualized
revenue and swelled to more than 300 employees since it first launched
in 2023. Coding tools have proved to be a lucrative AI use case.
OpenAI approached Anysphere to potentially purchase Cursor earlier
this year, but the deal failed to gain traction. 

 MURATI'S THINKING MACHINES IN FUNDING TALKS AT $50 BILLION VALUE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Thinking Machines Lab is in early talks to raise new funding at a
roughly $50 billion valuation. The new financing would more than
quadruple the startup's valuation from July. The deal's terms have yet
to be finalized and could change. Thinking Machines aims to build AI
models and products to help businesses by supporting more 'human-AI
collaboration' across every field of work. The startup has dozens of
employees who previously worked at OpenAI. 

 GOOGLE ADDS DEEP RESEARCH IN NOTEBOOKLM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's latest update to NotebookLM introduces Deep Research, a
feature designed to support high-quality source integration, and adds
support for analyzing new file types, including spreadsheets and Word
documents.

 NANO BANANA CAN BE PROMPT ENGINEERED FOR EXTREMELY NUANCED AI IMAGE
GENERATION (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nano Banana allows for very strong generation control, but it has
several issues. It is terrible at style transfer, even though it has
essentially no restrictions on intellectual property. The model can be
used to create highly specific, high-quality images. This article
looks at some of the tricks to using the model. 

 AI-ORCHESTRATED CYBERATTACK DETAILED BY ANTHROPIC (28 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Anthropic disclosed the first documented AI-driven cyber espionage
campaign, carried out largely autonomously using its Claude Code tool.
The attackers, linked to a Chinese state-sponsored group, targeted 30+
entities worldwide, demonstrating the growing threat of agentic AI
systems in cybersecurity.

 GENAI OBSERVABILITY: 6 PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 GenAI and agentic AI are powerful but unpredictable. It's not just
hallucination — they regularly take entirely new paths through
established workflows. Clarity requires more than monitoring: this
Dynatrace report [10] lays out six pragmatic observability
recommendations for practitioners preparing their organizations for
GenAI and agentic AI. Read the report [10] 

 INTRODUCING GPT-5.1 FOR DEVELOPERS (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GPT-5.1 uses fewer tokens on simple tasks and shows modest benchmark
gains on SWE-bench (+3.5 points to 76.3%) and GPQA Diamond (+2.4
points to 88.1%). On other capabilities, its benchmark scores are flat
or slightly lower. 

 INTRODUCING CODE WIKI: ACCELERATING YOUR CODE UNDERSTANDING (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Code Wiki is a platform that maintains a continuously updated,
structured wiki for code repositories. It scans the full code base and
regenerates documentation after each change, so docs evolve with the
code. Every wiki section and chat answer is hyperlinked directly to
the relevant code files and definitions. The platform will allow new
contributors to start immediately, while senior developers can now
understand new libraries in minutes. 

 WEIGHT-SPARSE TRANSFORMERS HAVE INTERPRETABLE CIRCUITS (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 OpenAI trained language models with most weights forced to zero,
making it easier to identify which neurons link together into a
“circuit” representing a certain concept. The approach
successfully isolated circuits for tasks like Python quote-matching
that are both necessary (removing them breaks the behavior) and
sufficient (they work in isolation).

 GOOGLE IS ROLLING OUT CONVERSATIONAL SHOPPING—AND ADS—IN AI MODE
SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google users in the US will soon be able to ask AI Mode complex
questions about what to buy. The model will respond with suggestions,
guides, tables, and other generated content to help them decide. Some
of the content that appears in AI Mode will be ads. There will be an
agentic checkout feature that lets AI automatically make purchases
with Google Pay at specific retailers. Shopping features are also
coming to the Gemini app, but there won't be sponsored content in the
results for the time being. 

 JEVONS OR BUST (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Demand for AI is growing, and it seems that it is paying demand. AI
is driving incremental revenue to big cloud providers. However, this
doesn't mean that AI is definitely a Jevonic-non-bubble instead of a
capex binge that ends badly. We have yet to see whether the demand
side will materialize.
