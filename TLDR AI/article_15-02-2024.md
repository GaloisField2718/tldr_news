 OPENAI STOPPED STATE-SPONSORED ACTORS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI discovered and terminated accounts affiliated with
nation-states using GPT models for malicious cases. 

 ANDREJ KARPATHY LEAVES OPENAI (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and former leader of
Tesla's Autopilot team, announced his departure from OpenAI to focus
on personal projects. His exit is not due to any specific event,
issue, or drama. 

 NVIDIA‚ÄôS NEW CHATBOT RUNS LOCALLY ON YOUR PC (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NVIDIA has launched a demo of Chat with RTX, a local PC-run chatbot
that can analyze and summarize personal data from various file formats
and even integrate knowledge from YouTube videos, with the aim of
creating a more personalized digital assistant experience. This
innovation, which does not require cloud processing or an internet
connection for sensitive data, is currently limited to Windows PCs
with specific NVIDIA GPUs.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VIDEO LANGUAGE MODEL THAT CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HOUR LONG VIDEOS
(12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This model uses ring attention and a fine-tuned 7B parameter model to
accurately answer million token video length questions. It outperforms
commercial VLMs and has extremely accurate performance on retrieval
benchmarks. 

 LUMIERE TEXT TO VIDEO MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google has a new text-to-video model that can help take images and
styles as input. It uses a novel ‚Äúspace-time UNet‚Äù to diffuse
everything at once. 

 CRAFTING LONG VIDEOS WITH CREATIVE AI TRANSITIONS (4 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 SEINE is an innovative video diffusion model guided by textual
descriptions designed to extend short AI-generated video clips into
longer, story-level sequences with seamless and imaginative scene
transitions.

 üëÄ SEE WHY CODY IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR AN ENTERPRISE-GRADE AI
CODING ASSISTANT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Cody uses¬†a¬†deep understanding of your codebase [13]¬†to explain,
fix, and help you write code. It‚Äôs universal, meaning it works
within your existing tech stack. Sourcegraph‚Äôs¬†code intelligence
platform [12]¬†allows Cody to autocomplete, explain, and edit your
code with¬†much richer context [12].
Write better code, faster.¬†Book a demo or try Cody yourself. [14]

 MAGNET AUDIO GENERATION MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Facebook released a state-of-the-art open-source audio model that is
7x faster than alternatives without sacrificing quality. It can
generate music and sound effects. The paper is now available. 

 PRIVACY IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Researchers conducted a comprehensive study on whether it's possible
to tell if a data point was used to train a large language model. They
tested various models and found that, for the most part, these attacks
are no better than random guesses. 

 TRUSTWORTHY AUTONOMOUS AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This project introduces advanced methods to ensure that autonomous
intelligent agents, which are crucial in life-dependent applications,
remain trustworthy and ethical even as they evolve.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHY "CHAT OVER YOUR DATA" IS HARDER THAN YOU THINK (8 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Building domain-specific, chat-based LLM applications and copilots is
harder than people think. Some of the challenges include achieving
robust performance, handling complex data and complex queries, and
enabling robust data retrieval for LLM-based chat applications. 

 TEXT-DRIVEN IMAGE EDITING WITHOUT MASKS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers have developed a unique method for editing images based
on text prompts. This approach uses a text-to-image model and a
bounding box generator to identify regions for editing, allowing for
changes without needing masks or sketches. 

 VIDEO ANNOTATOR FOR ENHANCED VIDEO CLASSIFICATION (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 The Video Annotator framework involves domain experts directly in the
annotation process. This new approach, integrating human expertise
with zero-shot and active learning techniques, improves model accuracy
and efficiency.
