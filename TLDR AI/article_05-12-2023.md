 Tired of guessing whether your model is good enough? Openlayer [5]
lets you build AI products with the rigor of traditional software ‚Äî
with testing, evaluation, and observability [5].
Manage models, identify edge cases, and detect production errors. It
only takes. one line of code [5] to get started:

	* Choose from a suite of tests [5] for data quality and overall
performance (e.g. hallucination score, feature drift, context recall).
	* Monitor your models with real-time alerts [5] in email, Slack, or
in-app.
	* Track and version [5] models, datasets, and prompts.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI AGREED TO BUY $51 MILLION OF AI CHIPS FROM A STARTUP BACKED BY
CEO SAM ALTMAN (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 During his tenure, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman planned to purchase $51
million worth of AI chips from Rain AI, a company in which he
personally invested. Despite his firing and reinstatement, OpenAI
expressed possible future collaboration with Rain. This aspect
highlights Altman‚Äôs intertwining roles as a vested investor and CEO,
which contributed to his firing. 

 NOUS RESEARCH RELEASES HERMES 2.5 VISION MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Built on top of the best 7B language model with SigLIP integration,
this vision model is a powerful new open source text and vision model
that can run on consumer hardware. One of the cool innovations here is
the integration of function calling. The model is still in alpha
because of a hallucination issue. 

 PERPLEXITY AI UNVEILS ‚ÄòONLINE‚Äô LLMS THAT COULD DETHRONE GOOGLE
SEARCH (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perplexity AI's combination of a web index and up-to-date information
with a conversational AI chatbot-style interface has the potential to
dethrone Google. The company recently released fine-tuned and
augmented versions of open source models from Mistral and Meta. The
models aim to offer helpful, factual, and up-to-date information. They
are the first-ever live LLM APIs that are grounded with web search
data and have no knowledge cutoff.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLMS AS FUNCTIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When slotting in language models to your code base, a useful mental
model is treating them like functions with standard input and output.
This blog, from the creator of React Native, shows a few ways you can
do that and the benefits of modeling your models this way. 

 LINEAR-TIME SEQUENCE MODELING (24 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Another state spaces paper with improved scaling and performance. In
this case, they borrow ideas from the LSTM and train a 3B parameter
model that outperforms larger 7B parameter Transformer models. 

 VIDEO MOTION EDITING WITH A NOVEL DIFFUSION MODEL (16 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 MotionEditor is a diffusion model designed for video motion editing,
skillfully balancing motion manipulation and original content
preservation. It introduces a content-aware motion adapter and a
unique two-branch architecture with attention injection, allowing
seamless integration of edited motions while maintaining the original
background and protagonist's appearance.

 AICONFIG BY LASTMILE AI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 LastMile AI open-sourced a library, AI Config, to decouple and
abstract away models, parameters, and prompts. AI Config allows
developers to easily swap between model providers and develop
model-agnostic applications. 

 DIFFUSION MODELS AS PRIOR FOR VISUAL PREDICTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [16]


 A new method called Diffusion Models as Prior (DMP) improves the
accuracy of semantic predictions in AI-generated images. This
innovative approach cleverly adapts pre-trained text-to-image models
for various tasks like 3D property estimation and semantic
segmentation, outperforming existing techniques even with limited
training data. 

 PROTECT TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS FROM MALICIOUS ADAPTATIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The new IMMA technique offers a unique solution to safeguard
text-to-image models from being maliciously adapted to generate
harmful content.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI AND TRUST (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The speaker in the talk highlights the distinction between
interpersonal and social trust, cautioning that our tendency to
anthropomorphize AI as friends rather than services can be exploited
by profit-driven corporations. They advocate for government
intervention through transparency laws and regulations aimed at humans
behind AI and call for the development of public AI models to ensure
AI remains a trustworthy and beneficial service in society. 

 AI DOOMERS ARE WORSE THAN WRONG - THEY‚ÄôRE INCOMPETENT (8 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 This article criticizes the AI doomer movement within OpenAI for
strategic blunders and counterproductively accelerating AI development
rather than ensuring its safety. 

 GENERATIVE AI FOR BEGINNERS (ONLINE COURSE) [20] 

 Microsoft released a 12 lesson course on generative AI for beginners.
