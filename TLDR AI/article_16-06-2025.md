HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMD'S AI FUTURE IS RACK SCALE 'HELIOS' (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AMD's MI400 will rival Nvidia's Blackwell chips with rack-scale
architecture that enables thousands of GPUs to function as unified
systems. The company claims 40% better tokens/$ compared to NVIDIA.
Its roadmap includes a path to 20x rack-scale energy efficiency by
2030. 

 GOOGLE, SCALE AI'S LARGEST CUSTOMER, PLANS SPLIT AFTER META DEAL (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's $14 billion acquisition of a 49% stake in Scale AI prompted
Google to pull its planned $200 million contract for human-labeled
training data over fears of exposing sensitive data to Meta.
Microsoft, xAI, and OpenAI are also backing away from Scale AI over
the same competitive concerns. The exodus benefits Scale's
competitors, with Labelbox expecting "hundreds of millions" in new
revenue as AI labs seek neutral data providers or move operations
in-house.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HAVE LLMS FINALLY MASTERED GEOLOCATION? (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Open-source intelligence researchers tested 20 AI models on 500
geolocation challenges using unpublished travel photos to ensure
models couldn't rely on memorized training data. OpenAI's latest
models outperformed Google Lens by cross-referencing architectural
styles, vegetation patterns, and partially visible text, while
competitors like Claude often managed only continent-level guesses.
However, all models still hallucinated. "Deep research" modes
paradoxically performed worse than standard versions. 

 LOW-BIT QUANTIZATION WITH PARETOQ (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ParetoQ is a new training algorithm that unifies binary, ternary, and
2-to-4 bit quantization, achieving state-of-the-art results across all
levels.

 😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR) [9] 

 QA Wolf's [10] AI-native service gets web and mobile apps to 80%
automated test coverage in less than 4 months.

They create and maintain your test suite in open-source Playwright.
Plus, they provide unlimited parallel test runs [11] on their
infrastructure (24-hour maintenance included).

The result? Salesloft saves $750k/year [12] in QA engineering +
executes 300+ tests in parallel on every PR in minutes.

 NEW INSIGHTS FOR SCALING LAWS IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Research from Waymo confirms that, similar to language modeling,
increased data and compute resources can enhance the performance of
autonomous vehicles. The finding has exciting implications for the
development of autonomous vehicles as researchers and developers now
know with certainty that enriching the quality and size of the data
and models will deliver better performance. It opens up the
possibility of devising more adaptive training strategies for planning
tasks in robots. 

 THE AI EVAL FLYWHEEL: SCORERS, DATASETS, PRODUCTION USAGE, & RAPID
ITERATION (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 There was a surprising consistency in the general eval frameworks
discussed at the 2025 AI Engineer World's Fair. Most of them involved
structuring inputs and how outputs are evaluated and evolving these
inputs and evals based on real production usage. The more they can
iterate, the better the experience they can deliver, so they try to
make eval flywheels as quick and frictionless as possible. One of the
key ideas is to have 'playgrounds' to make it easy to tweak a feature
and run it against datasets and evals. 

 HOW ANTHROPIC BUILT THEIR DEEP RESEARCH SYSTEM (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In this engineering blog post, Anthropic details its findings in
prompt design, tool coordination, and production reliability
challenges when orchestrating multi-agent systems. Its design uses an
orchestrator-worker pattern where a lead agent spawns specialized
sub-agents that search in parallel, far outperforming a single-agent
Opus-based method. Token usage alone explains 80% of performance
variance, with multi-agent systems consuming 15x more tokens than a
regular chat but enabling much more complex research tasks. 

 SELF-ADAPTING LANGUAGE MODELS (30 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new training approach enables LLMs to generate "self-edits" that
produce persistent weight updates through supervised fine-tuning. The
framework outperformed GPT-4.1 despite using a smaller model, but
suffered from catastrophic forgetting and required 15x more tokens
than standard inference. This addresses the looming data wall and
limitations on personalization and memory by enabling models to
bootstrap their own improvement through self-generated training
material rather than relying on external human-generated text.

 GOOGLE'S VEO FOR LIVE-ACTION VIDEOS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google DeepMind collaborated with filmmakers to produce "ANCESTRA," a
hybrid film blending live-action with Veo-generated video. New Veo
features enabled personalized, motion-matched generative content for
seamless visual integration. 

 FEATHERLESS AI ON HUGGING FACE (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Featherless AI is now available as an inference provider on Hugging
Face. It offers serverless access to a wide variety of models from
Meta, Qwen, DeepSeek, and others. 

 AUTOMATED ISSUE RESOLUTION DATA PIPELINES (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 SWE-Factory provides automated training and evaluation pipelines for
GitHub issue resolution tasks. It is powered by LLM-based multi-agent
systems.
