 [REPORT] OVER 500 CEOS WORLDWIDE SHARE THEIR AI CONFESSIONS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Turns out, CEOs have confessions  [4]to make. Dataiku has the
answer.

 	* 74% of CEOs admit their job is at risk if they fail to deliver
measurable AI-driven business gains.
 	* 94% suspect employees are using GenAI tools without approval —
exposing a massive governance failure.
 	* 54% admit a competitor already has a superior AI strategy.

Dataiku's latest report, The Global AI Confessions Report: CEO
Edition, [4] makes one thing clear: AI execution is where companies
win or lose. Dataiku empowers organizations to take charge [4] of
their AI talent, processes, and technologies — turning AI strategy
into real, measurable impact.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL LAUNCHES AGENTS API (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral's new Agents API enables persistent, multi-agent workflows
with built-in connectors for code execution, web search, RAG, image
generation, and MCP support. 

 OPENAI LAUNCHES "SIGN IN WITH CHATGPT" (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is developing a system that lets users sign into third-party
apps using their ChatGPT accounts, similar to "Sign in with Google,"
and is seeking developer partners. 

 CLAUDE'S VOICE MODE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic is launching a beta voice mode for Claude on mobile,
enabling users to engage in voice-based tasks like summarizing
calendars or searching documents.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW AI IS ERODING THE NORMS OF WAR (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Battlefield reporting reveals how AI-powered weapons are outpacing
international law and creating a "race to the bottom" in warfare
ethics. In Ukraine, drones are causing 70-80% of casualties, and
combatants are using civilian disguises and human shields to evade AI
targeting systems that struggle to distinguish between military and
civilian targets. 

 OAUTH FOR AGENTIC AI (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft outlined how next-gen AI agents will require evolved
identity and access standards, as it shifts from reactive assistants
to proactive collaborators capable of operating autonomously across
systems. 

 EFFICIENT GRPO AT SCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Liger is an optimized trainer for Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) that cuts memory usage by 40% and adds FSDP and PEFT support,
making reinforcement learning fine-tuning more efficient and scalable.

 GOOGLE OPEN SOURCES LMEVAL FOR CROSS-MODEL EVALUATION (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 LMEval is a framework for benchmarking AI models across different
providers with multimodal support and incremental evaluation. 

 LEARNING TO REASON WITHOUT EXTERNAL REWARDS (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 INTUITOR is a reinforcement learning method that uses an LLM's
internal confidence level as a reward signal instead of costly
domain-specific supervision. The resulting models match performance on
math benchmarks while achieving superior generalization on coding
tasks, offering a potential alternative to current RL methods that
struggle without verifiable rewards. 

 BENCHMARKING AUDIO-VISUAL QA (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Daily-Omni is a benchmark and training-free agent for evaluating
models on tasks requiring synchronized audio-visual understanding.
