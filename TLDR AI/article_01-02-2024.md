HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL CEO CONFIRMS ‚ÄòLEAK‚Äô OF NEW OPEN SOURCE AI MODEL NEARING
GPT-4 PERFORMANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The AI community is abuzz with a leaked large language model called
"miqu-1-70b" that was shared on HuggingFace and 4chan. The model shows
performance rivaling OpenAI's GPT-4 and is linked to Mistral's Mixtral
8x7b. This incident, acknowledged by Mistral's CEO as a leak by an
enthusiastic customer, highlights the growing capabilities of open
source AI. 

 MICROSOFT LASERS AWAY LLM INACCURACIES (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dipendra Misra presented Layer-Selective Rank Reduction (LASER), a
technique that improves large language model (LLM) accuracy by
replacing a weight matrix with a smaller approximation, at the January
Microsoft Research Forum.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLAVA 1.6 (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The newest version of Llava, a vision language model, has improved
OCR, reasoning, and world knowledge. It matches Gemini on some tasks.
The Llava team plans to release data, code, and the model. 

 WEAVER: FOUNDATION MODEL FOR STORY TELLING (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Weaver is a series of models specifically trained to tell stories.
The largest model (34B params) outperforms GPT-4 on a storytelling
benchmark. 

 TEXT-BASED IMAGE INPAINTING (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This paper introduces a benchmark and two datasets for scene and
handwritten texts. Featuring original, corrupted, and assistant
images, the novel Global Structure-guided Diffusion Model (GSDM)
leverages text structure to efficiently recover clean texts. It shows
significant improvements in recognition accuracy and image quality.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LONG VIDEO UNDERSTANDING WITH OPTIMAL TRANSPORT (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Norton is a new approach to improving long-term video understanding
by addressing the multi-granularity noisy correspondence issue in
video-language studies. 

 LIDAR-BASED MOVING OBJECT SEGMENTATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (GITHUB
REPO) [13] 

 MF-MOS is a new model for better detecting moving objects in
autonomous driving using LiDAR technology. It uniquely separates
motion and semantic information, using residual maps for motion
capture and range images for semantic guidance. 

 MCTS IMPLEMENTATION IN JAX (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a state-of-the-art search
algorithm. It was used in AlphaGo and researchers are now working to
integrate it with language models. MCTS is notoriously tricky to
implement.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT CAN BE DONE IN 59 SECONDS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI has gotten good enough to accomplish multiple tasks in under a
minute, which means organizations and employees are going to have to
emphasize using AI for good, not bad. 

 COMMERCIALLY LICENSED LLAVA MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 FireLlava is a new open vision model trained on data that makes it
possible to use for commercial tasks. It matches the performance of
the original Llava, but not yet to the level of Llava 1.5. 

 SERVICENOW‚ÄôS STATEMENT ON AI (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ServiceNow, a $150b market cap company, last week announced that its
gen AI products drove the largest net new ACV contribution for its
first full quarter of any of its new product family releases ever,
including its original Pro SKU. We‚Äôre already seeing
enterprise-level AI applications drive meaningful revenue growth ‚Äì
that‚Äôs cool.
