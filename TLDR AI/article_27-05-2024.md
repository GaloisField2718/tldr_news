HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI AND META FIGHT TO PARTNER WITH CHARACTER.AI (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Silicon Valley AI firms are fighting to partner with Character.ai, a
fast-growing role-playing startup founded by AI pioneer Noam Shazeer.
This comes as many large firms are pouring money into smaller
companies. 

 SCARLETT JOHANSSON TOLD OPENAI NOT TO USE HER VOICE (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Scarlett Johansson alleges that OpenAI created a voice for ChatGPT
that mimics hers without consent, leading her to seek legal advice.
OpenAI has since paused using the voice and is discussing the issue
with her representatives. The situation highlights concerns over the
use of celebrity likenesses in AI applications. 

 GOLDEN GATE CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new research paper details the mapping of AI model Claude 3
Sonnet's inner workings, revealing "features" activated by concepts
like the Golden Gate Bridge. By adjusting these features' strengths,
researchers can direct Claude's responses to incorporate specific
elements, demonstrating a novel method of modifying large language
models. The research aims to enhance AI safety by precisely adjusting
model behaviors related to potential risks.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AT LYFT (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Lyft team used online reinforcement learning, rewarded by driver
future earnings, to match drivers with riders. They were able to
dramatically improve in real time and made an estimated $30m/year
extra for riders. 

 LESSONS ON REPRODUCIBLE EVALUATION OF LANGUAGE MODELS (45 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Evaluating language models is hard and details on how to do it are
hard to find outside of the largest firms. This paper shows a
reproducible and powerful set of evaluation criteria. It includes a
valuable discussion of perplexity evaluation in the appendix. 

 IMAGE PERSONALIZATION WITH CLASSIFIER-GUIDED DIFFUSION MODELS (16
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers introduce a new approach to customize diffusion models
for generating identity-preserving images from user-provided
references. Unlike traditional methods that require extensive
domain-specific training, this technique uses classifier guidance to
steer diffusion models without additional training.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MISTRAL FINETUNE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Mistral released an official repository to fine-tune its models. 

 ENSEMBLING LORA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LoRA-Ensemble is a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for
self-attention networks. This technique, which extends Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for implicit ensembling, allows for accurate and
well-calibrated predictions without the high computational cost of
traditional ensemble methods. 

 MODULAR NORM FOR NEURAL NETWORKS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Modular norm is a new method for normalizing weight updates in neural
networks that scales training efficiently across different network
sizes.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOBILENET-V4 (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MobileNet is a computer vision model with extreme performance and
speed. It can run on edge devices. This blog post outlines the new
model and some modern changes that went into its creation. 

 MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FEATURES IN LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project investigates whether language models use
multi-dimensional features for computation, challenging the linear
representation hypothesis. 

 AI'S COMMUNICATION REVOLUTION: WE'RE ALL TALKING TO COMPUTERS NOW (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 GPT-4o, OpenAI's latest AI model, bridges real-time communication
between humans and machines, extending capabilities beyond text to
include vision and audio. The AI revolution introduces a new wave of
human-to-AI and eventual AI-to-AI interactions, likely impacting the
dynamics of our social behaviors and business models. As this
technology progresses, its effect on human communication will unfold,
potentially catalyzing the creation of innovative companies and
software solutions.

 MIXTRAL 8X22B ON A $400 CPU FASTER THAN READING SPEED (GITHUB
DISCUSSION) [17] 

 Thanks to recent advances from Mozilla's Llamafile project, it is now
possible to run inference for the flagship model from Mistral at 20
tokens per second on a commodity CPU. 

 I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MY ONE WILD AND PRECIOUS LIFE DEALING WITH
GOOGLE'S AI SEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's AI search feature is causing frustration by adding an
uninvited three-second delay to search results, disrupting the user
experience with unwanted information. 

 LLMS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR (ADVANCED) BRAINSTORMING (4 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Large language models struggle with truly innovative brainstorming,
often converging to consensus-based ideas rather than generating novel
concepts.
