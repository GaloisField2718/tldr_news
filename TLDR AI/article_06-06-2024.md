 üéØ MASTER THE ART OF MODEL SELECTION IN THIS RECORDED SESSION
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 OctoAI's experts will show you how to avoid "model fatigue" and pick
the perfect open-source model for your project.

In this video, you'll learn how to:¬†

	* Narrow down the vast universe of models to a shortlist tailored to
your needs
	* Decide between checkpoints, LoRAs, and Community tunes for your
specific use case
	* Evaluate model success across prompts, data, training, and tuning

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CARTWHEEL RAISES $5.6M SEED ROUND FOR GENERATIVE 3D ANIMATION TOOL (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cartwheel, a motion synthesis start-up by our very own Andrew Carr,
has raised a seed round led by Accel and KV. The company has built a
text-to-animation tool and powerful integration into existing 3D
workflows. 

 MISTRAL LAUNCHES FINE-TUNING API (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mistral has launched customization for its models via its platform
and API. 

 IT'S NOT JUST YOU: GOOGLE SEEMINGLY SCALED BACK AI OVERVIEWS AFTER
ITS ROCKY LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has scaled back AI Overviews. The AI-generated answers are now
appearing in around 11 percent of queries, down from around 27 percent
when the feature was launched last month. The company is still in the
process of refining the feature. AI Overviews are appearing most in
health-focused searches, despite the company highlighting the tool's
use for shopping, restaurant recommendations, and travel in its
marketing.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GOOGLE OPTIMIZES SHIPPING ROUTES (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The operations research group at Google improved mathematical
optimization for cargo shipping routes. They found a 13% reduction in
fuel usage and costs. 

 DREAMMAT: HIGH-QUALITY PBR MATERIAL GENERATION (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Dream Mat is a great way to improve texture generation for 3D
objects. It uses a number of classical graphic techniques such as
Albedo, Metallic, and Roughness to render an extremely compelling
output given a 3D mesh. 

 LLAMACARE FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have introduced LlamaCare, a fine-tuned large language
model (LLM) for medical knowledge, along with Extended Classification
Integration (ECI) to address classification issues in LLMs.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 üîé ORCA SECURITY'S AI-POWERED SEARCH HELPS USERS GET FAST ANSWERS
BY ASKING PLAIN LANGUAGE QUESTIONS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Security teams have long struggled to understand what's in their
cloud environments and their exposure to risks. As part of Orca's move
towards AI-driven cloud security [12], the platform now answers
natural language questions such as ‚Äúdo we have any S3 Buckets that
allow public READ access?‚Äù. Read more and see examples on the Orca
blog [13] 

 EXPLAINABLE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 XRec is a model-agnostic framework that leverages the language
capabilities of large language models to enhance explainable
recommender systems. 

 NEURAL SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 GenS is an end-to-end generalizable neural surface reconstruction
model that excels in reconstructing surfaces from multi-view images
without 3D supervision. 

 EFFICIENT LLMS WITHOUT MATRIX MULTIPLICATION (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Researchers have found a way to eliminate matrix multiplication
(MatMul) from large language models while maintaining strong
performance, even at the billion-parameter scale.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STABLE AUDIO OPEN (HUGGING FACE HUB) [17] 

 Stability AI has released the weights to Stable Audio which was
trained to generate sound effects on permissively licensed audio
samples. 

 I'M BEARISH OPENAI (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI's recent brain drain and focus on consumer products
complicates its path to competing with big tech. 

 THE FUTURE OF FOUNDATION MODELS IS CLOSED-SOURCE (10 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 The future of AI foundation models will be closed-source due to the
centralizing forces of data and compute, which favor economically
viable and secure closed models over open-source alternatives.
