 UNCHECKED AI AGENTS ARE A RISK: HOW TO SECURE ACCESS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI agents and MCP servers are powerful—but without proper access
control, they can become liabilities. When agents and services have
unchecked access, data exposure and unintended actions are inevitable.

Enter WorkOS AuthKit [5]—your authorization layer for AI agents and
services. With scoped OAuth access and built-in role-based access
control, you can assign roles, define permissions, and lock down
exactly what each service can access.

 AMAZON'S WAREHOUSE STOWING ROBOT SHOWS PROMISE AND LIMITATIONS (14
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Amazon's custom stowing robot matches human performance in warehouse
operations while highlighting robotics' current frontier - its

 CHINA'S AI DATA CENTER BOOM FACES COLLAPSE AS DEMAND FALTERS (8
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 China's AI infrastructure boom has led to severe overcapacity, with
80% of computing resources across 500+ new data centers sitting
unused. DeepSeek's R1 model fundamentally changed market dynamics by
shifting demand from training-focused to inference-optimized hardware,
rendering many facilities obsolete. Despite this market correction,
China has continued to aggressively invest in infrastructure to
compete with U.S. initiatives like the $500 billion Stargate project.

 JOURNALISTS REVEAL NUANCED APPROACHES TO AI INTEGRATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A survey of media professionals from Reuters, The Washington Post,
VentureBeat, 404 Media, and others shows newsrooms are adopting AI
selectively, embracing it for transcription, data analysis, and
translation while rejecting AI content creation. While Reuters reports
that AI now generates about 25% of its code, many journalists remain
skeptical, prioritizing maintaining audience trust and journalistic
integrity over technological efficiency.
