HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI ANNOUNCES GPT-4.5, WARNS IT'S NOT A FRONTIER AI MODEL (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-4.5 as a research preview for ChatGPT Pro
users. The model offers enhanced writing capabilities and improved
world knowledge but is not considered a frontier model. It will roll
out to Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu users in the coming weeks. 

 GPT 4.5 SYSTEM CARD (75 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The newest model from OpenAI is their largest yet. It was trained on
the same recipe as 4o, which means it is a multimodal model. It is
likely the last large pre-training run that OpenAI releases. They
claim it isn't a frontier model, but don't provide much explanation.
They do show that it has significantly reduced hallucinations compared
to previous model generations. 

 META PLANS STANDALONE AI CHATBOT APP (4 MINUTE READ) [6]

 EMERGENT MISALIGNMENT: NARROW FINETUNING CAN PRODUCE BROADLY
MISALIGNED LLMS (PDF) [8] 

 A strange and unsettling result from alignment. The authors of this
paper show that if you tune a model to output insecure code, then it
becomes broadly misaligned with user intent, and in some cases begins
to actively produce harmful content. 

 DEEPMIND'S HCI RESEARCH IN THE AGI ERA (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article outlines the role of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
research in shaping AI technologies as they progress toward AGI. It

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DUALPIPE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Continuing their open source releases, DeepSeek presents their novel
parallelism strategy to distribute a model with strong overlap in
compute and communication. 

 DIFFUSION STUDIO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Platform and codebase by modelscope that provides useful abstractions
for many types of diffusion models and their associated auto encoders.


 UNCERTAINTY IN CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12]

MISCELLANEOUS

 IT'S TIME TO ADMIT THE 'AI GADGET' ERA WAS A FLOP (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Humane has shut down and its AI Pin will be bricked, signaling the
failure of recent AI gadget ventures. The Rabbit R1 and Humane Pin,
initially seen as potential smartphone alternatives, couldn't deliver
on their promises. The AI gadget era has effectively ended as
impractical and unnecessary compared to integrating AI into existing
devices. 

 THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WEIRD ABOUT THIS $30 BILLION AI STARTUP BY A
MAN WHO SAID NEURAL NETWORKS MAY ALREADY BE CONSCIOUS (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Ilya Sutskever's new venture, Safe Superintelligence, has raised $1
billion, boosting its valuation to $30 billion despite having no
product yet. The company aims to eventually release a superintelligent
AI but remains vague about its roadmap. This speculative approach has
attracted significant investment, although experts doubt the near-term
arrival of AGI. 

 AVOIDING PITFALLS OF AI FOR DESIGNERS: GUIDING PRINCIPLES (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Designing AI products requires placing humans at the center to avoid
bias and misinformation. Key challenges include managing user
expectations, building trust, ensuring accessibility, and addressing
biases. Adopting guiding principles like transparency, co-creation,
and adaptability can enhance ethical and effective AI design.
