HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META MOVIE GEN (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has trained a state-of-the-art movie model. It has 30B
parameters and took 6,144 H100s to train. The model was trained on 1B
images and 100m highly curated videos. Interestingly, it is a Temporal
Autoencoder and Flow matching Llama. Meta released a 92 page paper,
one of the most detailed research reports on the topic. 

 FINLLM LEADERBOARD (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Open FinLLM Leaderboard offers a specialized evaluation platform
tailored for financial language models. It focuses on tasks crucial
for finance, such as stock movement prediction, sentiment analysis,
and information extraction from financial reports. 

 OLLAMA IN BRAVE BROWSER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia's RTX-Acceleration combined with Ollama allows for running
local models in the browser.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EMBERS OF AUTOREGRESSION FOR O1 (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Large language models have limitations due to next token prediction.
However, OpenAI's o1 model was trained with a new objective over
reasoning traces. Despite this change, o1 still shows signs of
limitations due to next token prediction. 

 CONTEXTUAL DOCUMENT EMBEDDINGS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper describes a method that is almost like a neutral TF/IDF in
that it takes information from the entire corpus instead of just a
single embedding document. It essentially encodes contextual
information about neighboring documents. This method is
state-of-the-art on MTEB. 

 ENTP: ENCODER-ONLY NEXT TOKEN PREDICTION (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper shows a novel design architecture for using encoder-only
transformers as next token prediction models. This has been done in
other ways before, but the researchers find a great way to prevent
cheating. The models have hints of strong performance at scale and
also are capable of in-context learning.

 INFINITE DATA LOADERS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 New model testing is limited in the image domain by poor-quality
small datasets like CIFAR10. This GitHub repository contains a tool
that creates infinite complicated fractals as images or videos for
testing. 

 AUTO JOBS APPLIER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An immensely viral repository that uses language models to automate
the job application process and add an additional layer of
personalization to the process. 

 PAIRWISE DISTILLATION FOR DENSE RETRIEVAL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project proposes a new technique called Pairwise Relevance
Distillation (PairDistill) to improve the accuracy of dense retrieval
methods.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This study develops high-performance graph algorithms that help solve
complex, large-scale problems like detecting fraud in financial
networks or finding efficient delivery routes. 

 FACTUAL ACCURACY IN AI (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Integrative Decoding is a method that enhances the factual accuracy
of large language models, especially for open-ended tasks. 

 LIQUID FOUNDATION MODELS: OUR FIRST SERIES OF GENERATIVE AI MODELS
(11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Liquid AI has announced its first generation of Liquid Foundation
Models (LFMs), which deliver state-of-the-art performance with reduced
memory usage. The LFMs, optimized for various hardware, include a 1B,
3B, and 40B model and are already available on platforms like LIQUID
PLAYGROUND and soon on Cerebras. These models excel in handling
sequential data and offer innovations in efficiency and scaling across
industries such as financial services and biotechnology.
