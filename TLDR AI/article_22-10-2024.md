 🏷️ FOR SALE: YOUR PERSONAL DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A legal loophole allows data brokers to collect your personal data
and sell it to the highest bidder. This is used for all sorts of
nefarious purposes - from spam email [4] to more convincing deepfake
calls (thanks, AI!).

To get your data off these websites, you need to either:

 	* Contact dozens of them individually; or
 	* Sign up to Incogni [4] and never think about it again.

Incogni contacts dozens of data brokers on your behalf — getting
your data off the web, and making sure it stays off.

✅ Over 20,000,000 data removals completed to date

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STATE OF AI REPORT 2024 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The 2024 State of AI Report highlights the consolidation of
foundation models into practical products, with OpenAI leading
significant revenue generation. Key trends include convergence in
frontier lab performance, increasing focus on planning and reasoning
in LLM research, and the expansion of foundation models into
multimodal domains. Despite regulatory challenges, AI enterprises have
surged in value, though questions about long-term sustainability
persist. 

 ANTHROPIC QUICKSTARTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic Quickstarts offers projects like a customer support agent
and financial data analyst to help developers utilize the Anthropic
API quickly. These projects use Claude for natural language processing
and interactive data visualization. Each quickstart includes setup
instructions and supports community contributions. 

 XAI, ELON MUSK'S AI STARTUP, LAUNCHES AN API (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI has released a Grok-based generative AI API. It currently offers
a single model, "grok-beta," with function-calling capabilities. The
API is part of xAI's strategy to compete with AI leaders by leveraging
data from Musk's companies, including X. Despite some functionality
issues, xAI is rapidly expanding Grok's integration into the X
platform.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MINI-OMNI2: TOWARDS OPEN-SOURCE GPT-4O WITH VISION, SPEECH, AND
DUPLEX CAPABILITIES (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A powerful and open source attempt to recreate GPT-4o speech
capabilities. This particular model was trained by aligning modalities
with pre trained audio and speech encoders. 

 A UNIFIED MODEL FOR CONDITIONAL IMAGE GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 BiGR is a novel image generation model that uses compact binary
latent codes to improve both generation and representation abilities.
It's the first model to unify generative and discriminative tasks
within the same framework. The model features mechanisms like binary
tokenization and a unique entropy-ordered sampling method. 

 POSITIONAL BIASES IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 LongPiBench is a benchmark designed to assess the positional biases
in large language models (LLMs) when processing long contexts that
specifically targets biases arising from the spacing of multiple
pieces of relevant information.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LEAVE NO DOCUMENT BEHIND (SPONSOR) [11] 

 What if you could use EVERY document in your knowledge retrieval
systems? RESTRUCTURED, Kolena's innovative AI-powered platform, takes
heaps of unstructured data (documents, images, audio) and turns them
into structured and immediately actionable datasets. This webinar [11]
will showcase 3 use cases: document search and retrieval; analyzing
customer communications; and contract analysis. Register now [11] 

 MUSIC LANGUAGE CLIP LIKE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Clamp2 is a contrastive model that can be used for music and text
alignment. 

 BITNET CPP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Microsoft released an inference repository for its 1.58 Bit models,
which, if properly trained, can be run on consumer hardware. 

 SYNTHETIC DATA FOR LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Montessori-Instruct is a new framework for generating synthetic data
tailored to a student language model's learning process. It adjusts
the synthetic data generated by the teacher model to match the
student's learning preferences using local data influence and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO).

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPENAI O1: 10 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's o1 series hints at a shift from generative AI to
reasoning-focused models. The new AI paradigm emphasizes long-term
problem-solving over data generation, altering traditional scaling
laws and creating AI-rich and AI-poor user classes. OpenAI and others
are moving towards this reasoning-centric approach. Upcoming models
like GPT-4.5 and Gemini 2.0 will pave the way for the GPT-5 era. 

 REAL-WORLD TRADING COMPETITION (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This is a competition hosted by Jane Street where participants are
tasked with building models using real-world data from production
systems to offer insights into the complexities of financial markets. 

 OCP SUMMIT 2024: THE OPEN FUTURE OF NETWORKING HARDWARE FOR AI (6
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta introduced a next-generation disaggregated network fabric and
new network hardware for AI clusters at OCP 2024. It developed
Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF) to enhance scalability and
performance in AI training systems. Both new and existing hardware are
optimized for high throughput and efficiency, supporting advanced AI
applications with open, vendor-agnostic solutions.
