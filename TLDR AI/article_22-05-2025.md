 SIGNALFIRE REPORT: NEW GRAD TECH HIRING PLUMMETS AND ANTHROPIC
DOMINATES AI TALENT WARS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tech hiring for new graduates has collapsed by over 50% since
pre-pandemic levels while experienced engineers remain in high demand
as AI tools increasingly handle entry-level tasks. Anthropic has
emerged as the clear leader in the AI talent wars, maintaining an
impressive 80% employee retention rate while aggressively poaching
engineers from competitors. Talent is now 8 times more likely to leave
OpenAI or DeepMind for Anthropic than move in the reverse direction. 

 MINIMAL MCP + A2A EXAMPLE (30 MINUTE VIDEO) [10] 

 A toy example demonstrating the basics of Minimum Cost Path (MCP) and
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) ping checks. 

 BUILDING AN AGENTIC IMAGE GENERATOR THAT IMPROVES ITSELF (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Large language models exhibit strong capabilities in natural language
reasoning about visual imperfections, but they struggle to map these
high-level insights into precise pixel-space action. The models excel
when reasoning is constricted to discreet, well-scoped dimensions -
performance degrades when they are asked to balance abstract aesthetic
judgments with deterministic pixel-level corrections. This suggests
that the models have trouble bridging symbolic understanding and
spatial grounding, especially in iterative workflows that demand
surgical image edits.

 GOOGLE UNVEILS DEFENSE STRATEGIES AGAINST AI PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS
(5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google DeepMind's research on defending Gemini against indirect
prompt injection attacks reveals that more capable models aren't
inherently more secure, and defenses that work in static tests often
fail against adaptive attackers. Their findings show that "adversarial
training" - fine-tuning models on examples of malicious prompts -
significantly improved Gemini 2.5's resistance without degrading
performance on normal tasks. When they combined this approach with a
"Warning" defense, attack success rates plummeted from 94.6% to just
6.2%. 

 NEW TOOLS AND FEATURES IN THE RESPONSES API (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI has added built-in tools and features to the Responses API.
The API now has support for all remote Model Context Protocol (MCP)
servers and tools like image generation, Code Interpreter, and
improvements to file search. It has new features that improve
reliability, visibility, and privacy for enterprises and developers.
All of these tools and features are now available in the Responses
API, which supports the GPT‑4o series, GPT‑4.1 series, and
o-series reasoning models. Image generation is only supported on o3 in
the reasoning model series. 

 LLM FUNCTION CALLS DON'T SCALE; CODE ORCHESTRATION IS SIMPLER, MORE
EFFECTIVE. (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Giving large language models the full output of tool calls is costly
and slow. Output schemas enable developers to get structured data,
which can then be processed. Using code execution as a way to process
data from MCP tools opens the door to scaling the work of AI models.
However, allowing an execution environment to also access MCPs, tools,
and user data requires careful design as to where API keys are stored
and how tools are exposed.

 FUTUREHOUSE'S NEW AI SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED A NOVEL TREATMENT
FOR LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 FutureHouse combined specialized literature search agents with a data
analysis agent in a continuous experimental loop to accelerate medical
discovery. The system autonomously generates hypotheses from
literature reviews, proposes experiments for human execution, then
analyzes resulting data to inform the next research cycle. Through
this process, researchers identified ripasudil, an eye drop medication
that relaxes cellular tension, as a promising new treatment for the
leading cause of age-related vision loss, where retinal light-sensing
cells gradually deteriorate. The complete code, data, and agent
interaction traces will be publicly released on May 27. 

 MY PROMPT, MY REALITY (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AI products depend heavily on user prompts, unlike traditional
software with predictable outcomes. Skilled prompting can yield
varying results due to nuanced intent and context. Product teams can
improve results by refining prompts and using follow-up questions to
guide users.
