 SAM ALTMAN ON GPT-6: ‘PEOPLE WANT MEMORY' (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman said that GPT-6 will arrive more quickly than the two-year
gap between GPT-4 and GPT-5, emphasizing memory as the breakthrough
advancement. Personalization, specifically adjusting a model's
political beliefs, may satisfy a new executive order that requires
federal AI systems to be ideologically neutral. 

 DEEPSEEK V3.1 JUST DROPPED — AND IT MIGHT BE THE MOST POWERFUL OPEN
AI YET (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DeepSeek quietly released DeepSeek V3.1 on Tuesday. The 685-billion
parameter system challenges the dominance of American AI giants and
reshapes the competitive landscape. Early performance tests revealed
benchmark scores that rival proprietary systems from OpenAI and
Anthropic. The model's hybrid architecture seamlessly integrates chat,
reasoning, and coding functions into a single, coherent model. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG SHAKES UP META'S A.I. EFFORTS, AGAIN (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Mark Zuckerberg's restructuring creates separate teams for research,
superintelligence, products, and infrastructure as Meta abandons its
previous "Behemoth" frontier model to start fresh under new chief AI
officer Alexandr Wang. The shake-up includes potential downsizing of
the thousands-strong AI division and a strategic shift—Meta is now
exploring third-party AI models after years of relying exclusively on
its own technology. 

 XAI READIES GROK WEB WITH IMAGINE TOOL AND TEAM PROFILES (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Grok Imagine will enable users to generate images and short videos on
the web. The feature, already accessible to mobile users, offers a
dedicated gallery where people can view generations created by the
model. xAI is close to releasing Team accounts, which will enable
organizations to manage workspaces with isolated namespaces, dedicated
chat histories, and collaborative projects. It fits into xAI's broader
strategy of supporting both individual and enterprise workflows.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 MARKETPLACE: MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT TRAINING WITHOUT BACKPROP ON GPU
EFFICIENTLY (41 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 People from a decade ago would hardly believe that we have an
abundance of supercomputers in our homes. It's now possible to conduct
end-to-end experiments in a solo project with modern hardware. We're
entering into a new era of personal supercomputing. This article looks
at an approach to training without backpropagation on GPUs efficiently
- an experiment like this used to cost researchers an insane amount of
money and resources just to test the idea. 

 FASTER MOE TRAINING WITH CUSTOM CUDA KERNELS (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cursor rebuilt the Mixture-of-Experts layer from scratch using CUDA
and PTX, achieving a 3.5x speedup in MoE operations. This resulted in
a 1.5x end-to-end training speedup on Blackwell GPUs compared to
Hopper.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 1PASSWORD RESEARCH FINDS THAT SECURITY LEADERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH
UNMANAGED AI ACCESS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Our research found that _only 21% of security leaders report having
full visibility into the AI tools used in their organization_. As
organizations play catch-up with AI governance, they often find
they're unequipped to enforce their policies. Read the research and
learn how to mitigate AI access risks. [11] 

 LEMONADE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Lemonade is a server that helps users run local LLMs with the highest
performance by configuring state-of-the-art inference engines for
their NPUs and GPUs. It supports both GGUF and ONNX models - Lemonade
has a Model Manager that allows users to import custom models.
Lemonade makes it easy to switch between configurations at runtime. It
can be used with any OpenAI-compatible client library. 

 ACCELERATING MOES WITH TRITON GROUPED GEMM (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 PyTorch has introduced a cache-aware Triton BF16 Grouped GEMM kernel
optimized for Mixture-of-Experts models like DeepSeekv3. The
implementation offers up to 2.6× speedup over baseline PyTorch loops
by batching independent GEMMs into a single kernel call. 

 SIGNAL AND NOISE: REDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN LANGUAGE MODEL EVALUATION
(7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Benchmarks with high signal (ability to distinguish between models)
and low noise (consistency across training steps) are far more
reliable for making scaling decisions, with some benchmarks showing
32% error reduction when filtered by signal-to-noise ratio. An
analysis of 900K evaluation results across 465 models suggests that
quality evaluation sets matter more than large sample sizes. 

 NEXT VISUAL GRANULARITY FOR IMAGE GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 NVG introduces a structured sequence-based framework for image
generation, refining outputs progressively from global layout to fine
details. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DO LLMS HAVE GOOD MUSIC TASTE? (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Claude models favor classic artists, especially jazz musicians like
Herbie Hancock and Nina Simone. Reasoning models from OpenAI, xAI, and
DeepSeek exhibit a bizarre preference for artists with numbers or
dollar signs in their names, suggesting overly aggressive
reinforcement learning may be creating unintended biases. 

 DATABRICKS SAYS IT'S VALUED AT OVER $100 BILLION IN LATEST FUNDING
ROUND (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Databricks, now valued at over $100 billion, joins an exclusive club
of private companies at this valuation alongside SpaceX and OpenAI.
CEO Ali Ghodsi announced a new funding round exceeding $1 billion,
with the company projecting $3.7 billion in annual revenue. This
funding will support further AI product development, positioning
Databricks against rivals like Snowflake and major cloud providers.
