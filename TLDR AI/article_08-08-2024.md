HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI INTELLIGENCE IS COMING TO NEST CAMERAS, SMART SPEAKERS, AND
SMART DISPLAYS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google announced new Gemini AI-powered features for Google Home,
including intelligent captions for Nest camera footage, natural
language processing for Home routine creation, and an upgraded, more
natural-sounding Google Assistant. The advanced features, primarily
behind a Nest Aware subscription paywall, aim to enhance the smart
home experience with the rollout commencing in beta and expanding next
year. As part of the move toward smarter home automation, Google
envisions an assistant that can proactively manage complex and dynamic
home environments. 

 AS REGULATORS CLOSE IN, NVIDIA SCRAMBLES FOR A RESPONSE (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Nvidia is facing increased government scrutiny from the EU, UK,
China, and the US Justice Department over its dominant market share in
AI chips and sales practices. The company is rapidly building its
legal and policy teams to address antitrust concerns amid profitable
growth, as it commands 90 percent of the GPU market essential for AI
systems. Nvidia is also adapting to increased competition oversight,
with recent attention turning to its planned acquisition of Run.ai and
impact on the AI supply chain. 

 ZUCKERBERG SAYS META WILL NEED 10X MORE COMPUTING POWER TO TRAIN
LLAMA 4 THAN LLAMA 3 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta plans to significantly increase computing capacity for training
its next-gen large language model, Llama 4, expecting a 10x compute
increase over Llama 3. The investment in AI training infrastructure
will drive up capital expenditures in 2025. Despite heavy spending,
Meta doesn't foresee immediate significant revenue from Gen AI
products.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SCALING TEST TIME COMPUTE OPTIMALLY CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN
SCALING MODEL PARAMETERS (25 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is strong pressure to use compute at inference time to improve
model performance. This paper showcases several methods that can be
used and discusses the trade offs made between them. In general, this
points towards a broader trend of squeezing performance out of smaller
models. 

 LLAVA-ONEVISION: EASY VISUAL TASK TRANSFER (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There has been a push in vision language models to make them easy to
tune and transfer between tasks. This is reminiscent of computer
vision a decade ago. Importantly, this can be done through careful
data curation and architecture updates which are on display with
LLaVA-OneVision. 

 AN OBJECT IS WORTH 64X64 PIXELS: GENERATING 3D OBJECT VIA IMAGE
DIFFUSION (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Treating 3D objects as UV wrapped images makes it simple to use a DiT
model to synthesize novel objects based on textual inputs.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ABC INVARIANCE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 muP is a way to tune your hyperparameters to transfer from smaller to
larger models. This GitHub gist shows a great theorem in practice
which states that you can change where you scale model outputs and it
doesn't affect final transfer performance. 

 FLUX CANNY CONTROLNET (HUGGING FACE HUB) [11] 

 XLabs has released the first Flux-Dev control net which allows for
generation conditioned on Canny image inputs. 

 CREATE PRIVACY-PROTECTED TABULAR DATA (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 HARMONIC is a framework for generating and evaluating synthetic
tabular data using large language models.

 HOW GITHUB HARNESSES AI TO TRANSFORM CUSTOMER FEEDBACK INTO ACTION (8
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub is leveraging AI and machine learning to analyze and summarize
customer feedback at scale, informing product improvements and feature
prioritization with actionable insights. This automated approach
enables the capture of multilingual feedback and drives data-driven
decision-making, enhancing the responsiveness to developer needs. The
initiative highlights GitHub's commitment to integrating AI to
maintain a developer-centric product development process. 

 HOW DOES OPENAI SURVIVE? (31 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article presents a deep skepticism about OpenAI's
sustainability, considering generative AI's lack of broad market
utility and the prohibitive costs of developing and running large
language models. The author questions OpenAI's long-term viability
without significant technological breakthroughs or continuous,
unprecedented fundraising efforts. Despite OpenAI's influence on the
AI industry, the company faces challenges with profitability, high
operational burn rates, and dependence on strategic partnerships,
particularly with Microsoft. 

 AMD IS BECOMING AN AI CHIP COMPANY, JUST LIKE NVIDIA (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 AMD's Q2 2024 earnings show a significant shift toward data center
products, with nearly half of its sales now in this area, thanks
primarily to the Instinct MI300 AI chip. The company has committed to
annual new AI chip releases, competing with Nvidia's offerings,
despite supply constraints projected to last until 2025. Although
Nvidia remains ahead in the data center market, AMD has seen growth in
its CPU and GPU segments, including its Ryzen processors and Radeon
6000 GPUs.
