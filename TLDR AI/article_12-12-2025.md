 PROMPTS FOR OPEN PROBLEMS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post proposes different research problems in machine learning
research. The ideas include design-based machine learning, a theory of
competitive testing, going beyond average case evaluation certainty
equivalence in LLM reasoning, and open source, open corpus language
models. The research areas are all doable, there just needs to be a
will to do it. 

 BUSINESS AI ADOPTION FLATLINES (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI adoption held flat for 45% of businesses in November, and there
were slight declines in the finance and technology sectors. Adoption
rose in several industries with relatively low adoption rates, like
retail, construction, and manufacturing. The slowdown comes after a
rapid run-up in adoption rates in 2025. The effects of the latest
advancements seem to have faded. Another run-up in adoption will
likely require technological gains or implementation gains.

 CHATGPT'S ‘ADULT MODE' IS COMING IN 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [16]
