HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

APPLE IS POURING MONEY INTO SIRI IMPROVEMENTS WITH GENERATIVE AI (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/06/apple-is-pouring-money-into-siri-improvements-with-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai]

Apple has boosted its budget for developing artificial intelligence,
emphasizing creating conversational chatbot features for Siri ‚Äî
allegedly spending millions of dollars daily on research and
development.

FALCON 180B MODEL RELEASED (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://falconllm.tii.ae/falcon-models.html?utm_source=tldrai]

The Falcon models from the UAE have long been the best open models
available. The newest 180B parameter model slightly outperforms Llama
2 70B and has a 2k context window. The models have historically been
quite tunable. However, given the resource requirements, it's not
clear whether the community will adopt this newest model.

OPENAI‚ÄôS FIRST DEVELOPER CONFERENCE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/announcing-openai-devday?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI will hold its inaugural DevDay conference in San Francisco on
November 6, 2023. This event will preview new tools and foster idea
exchange, attracting hundreds globally. Currently, over 2 million
developers use tools like GPT-4 and DALL¬∑E through OpenAI's
continuously updated API.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

REDUCING PPO MEMORY USAGE IN RLHF (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00754?utm_source=tldrai]

PPO is a pain in RLHF because you need to have 3 models floating
around. However, they all stay close and only require small updates
from one another. Enter LoRA. If you instead use adapters you can
dramatically reduce memory costs without losing performance. Beautiful
idea in its simplicity.

SIMULATING AN ORDER BOOK IN JAX (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13289?utm_source=tldrai]

Financial institutions use something called a limit order book to
maintain all of the transaction information for trades on their
platforms. This is useful, but it usually runs on the CPU, which makes
running RL on them hard. This paper talks through creating an order
book that runs on the GPU written in JAX.

ENHANCING SPEECH-DRIVEN 3D FACE ANIMATION (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05428v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This study delves into the complexities of 3D face animation driven by
speech, highlighting two important aspects: global factors that change
how the face moves over time (composite nature) and how different
parts of the face move independently based on local muscles (regional
nature).

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

TOKENFLOW (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/omerbt/TokenFlow?utm_source=tldrai]

Using a pre-trained text-to-image model to edit videos produces
dream-like and strange results. TokenFlow is much smoother and
maintains many semantic and structural features of the original video.
It almost seems to outperform Runway Gen-2.

COMGRA (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/FlorianDietz/comgra?utm_source=tldrai]

A library for use with PyTorch that makes it easier to inspect the
internals of your neural networks.

MAKING VIDEO AVATARS ADAPT TO DIFFERENT LIGHTS AND BACKGROUNDS (3
MINUTE READ)
[http://haonanqiu.com/projects/ReliTalk.html?utm_source=tldrai]

ReliTalk is a cool tech breakthrough that lets us make video avatars
look natural even when you change the lighting or background. It uses
a single video and the sound of your voice to create a 3D face model.

CAN LLMS LEARN FROM A SINGLE EXAMPLE? (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/?utm_source=tldrai]

It appears that AI models were able to rapidly memorize examples from
the dataset after seeing them just once. This astonishing feat
contradicts most prior wisdom about neural network sample efficiency.

A NEW WAY TO TELL IF TWO SIMILAR PICTURES ARE REALLY THE SAME IN 3D (3
MINUTE READ) [https://doppelgangers-3d.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]

Doppelgangers is a new tech tool that helps figure out if two pictures
that look almost the same are actually showing the same 3D object or
not. It's smart enough to avoid mistakes that even people might make.

HOW THE AI REVOLUTION WILL RESHAPE THE WORLD (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://time.com/6310115/ai-revolution-reshape-the-world/?utm_source=tldrai]

An argument that the impending technological wave, largely driven by
AI, will herald a historic redistribution of power.

BUZZY AI STARTUP FOR GENERATING 3D MODELS USED CHEAP HUMAN LABOR (5
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.404media.co/kaedim-ai-startup-2d-to-3d-used-cheap-human-labor/?utm_source=tldrai]

Kaedim, a 3D generation startup, often used human artists to make
models, at one point using workers to produce the 3D design wholecloth
themselves.
