 🆕 SENTRY'S NEW DEBUGGING AGENT ACHIEVES 94.5% ACCURACY WHEN ROOT
CAUSING ISSUES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI is pretty good at creating bugs. Can it also resolve them?

SEER is Sentry's new AI agent — and the only AI agent that uses all
of the context that Sentry provides [4]: errors, stack traces, commit
history, logs, traces, spans, breadcrumbs.

Seer sifts through the data, finds the root cause of an issue (with
94.5% accuracy!), and can open a PR with a fix. Ship it, close the
tab, and move on with your life. It's private by default, supports
±any stack, and it actually works.

WATCH SEER WORK ITS MAGIC [5] and learn how the Sentry engineering
team uses Seer to automatically debug issues. Join the workshop →

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELON MUSK'S XAI RAISES $10 BILLION IN DEBT AND EQUITY AS IT STEPS UP
CHALLENGE TO OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 xAI has raised $5 billion in debt through secured notes and term
loans and $5 billion in equity secured through a strategic equity
investment. The debt offering was oversubscribed and included
prominent global debt investors. The funding will go towards the
startup's efforts to build out its AI infrastructure and develop its
Grok chatbot. It will continue buying Nvidia and AMD chips for a
1-million-GPU facility outside of Memphis. 

 GRAMMARLY TO ACQUIRE SUPERHUMAN TO ACCELERATE ITS AI PRODUCTIVITY
PLATFORM (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Grammarly is acquiring Superhuman to enhance its AI productivity
platform by integrating AI-native email capabilities. Superhuman users
send and respond to 72% more emails per hour with AI, showcasing
increased efficiency. This acquisition supports Grammarly's plan to
create applications as intelligent agents, positioning email as a key
platform for multi-agent assistance. 

 AMAZON LAUNCHES A NEW AI FOUNDATION MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon introduced a new AI foundation model to optimize warehouse
robotics and celebrated the milestone of deploying one million robots.
The model improves efficiency by 10% and supports faster deliveries.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 INSIDE OPENAI'S CHATGPT JOURNEY (65 MINUTE VIDEO) [9] 

 Nick Turley and Mark Chen discuss ChatGPT's viral launch, evolving
safety strategies, breakthroughs in multimodal models, and the rise of
agentic coding with Codex. They also share insights on internal
culture and the vision for AI-powered assistants. 

 FINETUNING SPARSE ENCODERS WITH SENTENCE TRANSFORMERS (39 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The latest update to Sentence Transformers introduces support for
training sparse embedding models, ideal for hybrid search and
reranking. The blog walks through model components and training steps
and highlights available SPLADE-based models.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 BUILDING A PERSONAL AI FACTORY (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post discusses how to build an AI factory that improves itself.
The aim of the project was to build a factory that can produce itself.
It aimed to create a factory of agents that can produce code, verify
it, and improve themselves over time. The post covers the idea behind
the AI factory, how to build the factory, scaling the factory, and
ideas for future improvement. 

 WHAT WE LEARNED TRYING TO DIFF BASE AND CHAT MODELS AND WHY IT
MATTERS (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers compared raw AI models with their chat-trained versions
to understand what safety training actually changes inside the
model—like finding the "off-limits" neurons that make a model refuse
harmful requests. They discovered that Anthropic's standard comparison
technique was hallucinating thousands of fake differences, but their
BatchTopK fix revealed real interpretable safety circuits like refusal
detection and stereotype filtering, capturing 88% of behavioral
changes versus just 60% for the broken method. 

 REFRAMING DEEP LEARNING PHENOMENA (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Arguing against case-by-case analysis of concepts like grokking or
double descent, these authors propose shifting focus toward broader
theories that offer more practical value for real-world deep learning
applications. 

 INTRODUCING CHAI-2: ZERO-SHOT ANTIBODY DESIGN IN A 24-WELL PLATE (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Finding antibodies that bind to disease targets usually means
screening massive libraries for months—most pharmaceutical discovery
is basically a numbers game. Chai Discovery's AI cuts straight to
viable drug candidates by designing them computationally, hitting 16%
success rates and finding working antibodies for 50% of targets with
just 20 attempts each.

 KEY PATHS, PLANS, AND STRATEGIES TO AI SAFETY SUCCESS (9 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Key AI safety paths include international cooperation, domestic
initiatives, and societal resilience. Strategies involve forming
alliances like CERN for AI, using deterrence to prevent unsafe
development, and fostering responsible actors within countries. A
diversified approach across these strategies offers insurance against
uncertainties and leverages various expertise. 

 COMMUNITY NOTES ON X (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 X launched a pilot allowing LLMs like Grok or ChatGPT to submit
Community Notes. These AI-generated notes will be vetted by humans and
subject to the same trust mechanisms as existing user contributions.
