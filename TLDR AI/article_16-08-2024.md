HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NOUSE HERMES 3 (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nous Research has released its flagship model. Trained on top of
Llama 3, the model has strong performance and a great personality like
many of the company's original models. 

 CALIFORNIA AI BILL SB 1047 AIMS TO PREVENT AI DISASTERS, BUT SILICON
VALLEY WARNS IT WILL CAUSE ONE (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 California's SB 1047, designed to prevent "critical harms" from large
AI models, faces pushback from Silicon Valley, with stakeholders
divided over its potential impact on innovation. Major industry
figures and companies debate the bill's merits and consequences on AI
development and safety. The bill, which requires AI model safety
protocols and third-party audits, with enforcement and hefty fines
outlined for non-compliance, is heading to a final Senate vote. 

 SOFTBANK'S INTEL AI PROCESSOR PLANS IN DOUBT AS INSIDERS SAY IT IS
NOW CONSIDERING A TSMC PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Intel failed to produce AI processors for SoftBank's Project Izanagi,
leading SoftBank to explore a partnership with TSMC. Despite setbacks,
SoftBank remains committed to challenging major AI players with its
own hardware and data center ecosystem, potentially backed by
significant investment from global partners. The move could strain
SoftBank's relationship with Arm clients as it risks direct
competition.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ANCHORED PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tuning models to align with human preferences usually requires some
post training. However, when training these models it is not clear why
one example is better than another. APO is a way for models to degrade
existing examples and then use that degraded example to anchor the
difference in preference. 

 MUTUAL REASONING MAKES SMALL MODELS SMARTER (34 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Tree search is an extremely active area of research for inference
time computation for language models. This paper from Microsoft shows
a particularly compelling case that enables small models to improve
dramatically on mathematics problems. 

 SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION WITH METASEG (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MetaSeg is a powerful semantic segmentation network built on the
MetaFormer architecture that enhances both the backbone and decoder of
the network.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 GITHUB REPO ‚≠ê DATACHAIN: UNSTRUCTURED DATA MANAGEMENT FOR AI
PROJECTS, REIMAGINED (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Iterative's new open-source tool lets you simplify AI projects and
scale unstructured data management. With DataChain, you can source,
curate, and version cloud data at scale [12]; easily integrate
metadata from various formats; parallelize local and API-based AI
model inferences for 3x-10x speedup [12]; and store AI model outputs
as Python data objects.

 LONG CONTEXT RAG (21 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post explores how long context models perform on various RAG
tasks. Improving the number of examples can help. These models often
fail in strange but predictable ways. 

 UNIVERSAL WAVEFORM GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PeriodWave is a new model for universal waveform generation that
excels in capturing the natural periodic features of high-resolution
waveform signals. 

 SECURITY RISKS IN MODEL MERGING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 As Model Merging (MM) becomes a popular method for combining
fine-tuned models without additional training, new security risks
emerge. This paper introduces BadMerging, the first backdoor attack
specifically targeting MM.

 A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY ON MODEL MERGING TECHNIQUES (41 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 This survey provides an in-depth review of model merging techniques,
an increasingly popular method in machine learning that doesn't
require raw training data or expensive computation. 

 BRANDS SHOULD AVOID ‚ÄúAI‚Äù (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A recent study found that labeling products as "AI-powered" can
decrease consumer intent to purchase due to trust issues and fears of
the unknown. The research suggests that both cognitive and emotional
trust are factors, with people wary of AI's inner workings and risks,
especially regarding personal data privacy. Companies are advised to
focus on clear messaging about AI benefits rather than using "AI" as a
buzzword. 

 TRANSFORMER EXPLAINER (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Beautiful visualization of the inner workings of a Transformer.

 ANOTHER APPLE SMART RING PATENT, INCLUDES CONTROL OF SMART GLASSES (2
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Apple's newly granted patent details a smart ring capable of health
monitoring and controlling other Apple devices, hinting at possible
integration with AR/VR headsets and smart glasses. 

 14% OF PCS SHIPPED GLOBALLY IN Q2 2024 WERE AI-CAPABLE (4 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 There was a significant increase in AI-capable PC shipments in Q2
2024 with 8.8 million units, representing 14% of total PCs shipped.
