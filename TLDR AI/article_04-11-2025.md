HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AWS AND OPENAI ANNOUNCE MULTI-YEAR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is moving a significant portion of its compute to AWS in a $38
billion, seven-year deal that provides immediate access to hundreds of
thousands of Nvidia GPUs with the ability to scale to tens of millions
of CPUs. OpenAI won't serve its models through AWS (yet) due to its
exclusive cloud relationship with Microsoft. 

 MICROSOFT SIGNS $9.7 BILLION CLOUD DEAL WITH IREN AS AI DEMAND SWELLS
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft inked a $9.7 billion deal with data-center operator IREN to
access Nvidia's advanced chips, addressing a computing crunch amid
increasing AI demand. This five-year partnership allows Microsoft to
boost capacity without constructing new facilities or securing
additional power. IREN's phased deployment, supported by Microsoft's
prepayment, will run through 2026.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHAT'S UP WITH ANTHROPIC PREDICTING AGI BY EARLY 2027? (23 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 To get Nobel-Prize-winning AIs by early 2027, AIs must fully automate
researching engineering by December 2026 and go from completing
hour-long tasks today to completing two-week-long tasks in just the
next 8 months. OpenAI is only slightly more conservative than
Anthropic, estimating automated AI research by March 2028. 

 BABY SHOGGOTH IS LISTENING (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI will replace human writers and readers. Influential figures in AI
like Tyler Cowen and Gwern argue that writers shouldn't optimize for
human readers served by algorithmic feeds but for LLMs that will
invariably train on their work. The motivation ranges from practical
(LLMs now mediate most information retrieval and composition) to
existential (influencing a future superintelligence may be the only
lasting legacy).

[10] as they discuss the skills your team needs to stay ready for
AI-driven workflows. Save your spot now 💺 [11] 

 QWEN3-MAX-THINKING (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Qwen3-Max-Thinking has been released in early preview. It currently
achieves 100% on challenging reasoning benchmarks like AIME 2025 and
HMMT when augmented with tool use and scaled test-time compute. The
model is available in Qwen Chat and the Alibaba Cloud API. 

 NOTES FROM READING THE AMP MANUAL (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Amp is a coding agent with support for MCP, the ability to set
project, folder, and global context, a permissions system, headless
mode, and more. It stores all threads on the server so users can
resume a thread anytime. Amp picks the right model for each task, but
it can be nudged to use more expensive models. It is pay-per-token and
not cheap, but it is worth it because it saves time. 

 ASSISTANT-UI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 assistant-ui is an open-source TypeScript/React library for building
production-grade AI chat experiences quickly. It handles streaming,
auto-scrolling, accessibility, and real-time updates, and works with
any custom backend. assistant-ui has broad model support out of the
box. It is fast to production and designed for customization with a
great developer experience.

MINUTE READ) [16]

meetings, enable the assistant to join certain meetings on its own,

concludes. They will help professionals and teams streamline meeting
documentation and follow-up and cut down on manual note-taking and
coordination. There is no timeline announced yet for the rollout of
these new features.
