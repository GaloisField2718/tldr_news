 _FEATURING SPEAKERS FROM OPENAI, PINECONE, TRUERA, AND MENLO
VENTURES_
There are many cool demos of LLM apps out there. Getting them into
production is an entirely different beast ‚Äî which requires scaling
up model and vector DB usage while managing costs

 BIG TECH STRUGGLES TO TURN AI HYPE INTO PROFITS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/jMM1k?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Tech giants are investing in costly generative AI tools, leading to
pricier software upgrades. Firms are exploring ways to balance
innovation with profitability while anticipating future cost
reductions. 

 CLEANLAB RAISES $30M TO HELP BUILD TRUSTWORTHY LLMS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://cleanlab.ai/blog/series-a-announcement/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Starting as an open sourced package at MIT, CleanLab has now grown
into an enterprise-grade no-code tool for curating high quality data
for industry ML pipelines.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PAPER FOR MISTRAL 7B MODEL (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825?utm_source=tldrai] 

 The Mistral 7B model was released via a tweet. It beats many models
twice its size. This paper explores some of the technical
contributions and details. No discussion of the pre-training dataset,
but good insights into the architecture. 

 IMPROVING MEMORY IN CONTINUAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06362v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This study explores the challenges faced in "continual learning",
where a model tries to keep learning new things without forgetting old
ones, especially in categorizing texts. It introduces a new method
called InfoCL, which uses special techniques to help the model
remember better and reduce mistakes. 

 MAKING AI-GENERATED SENTENCES SOUND NATURAL (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06363v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Researchers found that the sequence in which ideas or 'concepts' are
presented to models that generate sentences affects how good the
sentences turn out to be. Among various programs tested, BART-large
did the best job when given ideas in a certain order, but
surprisingly, bigger isn't always better.

 A CASE FOR GPT-4‚ÄôS CAPACITY TO REASON (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://lajili.com/posts/post-3/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Although GPT-4 lacks consciousness and long-term memory, there is
good evidence that it is able to reason and comprehend concepts. 

 UNIVERSAL, INTERACTIVE, REAL WORLD SIMULATOR (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://universal-simulator.github.io/unisim/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 What if your simulator was generative AI? It would work to zero shot
transfer robotic policies! This work from DeepMind and colleagues
tackles the challenge that RL usually can't generalize past the
training environment. If we just make everything the training
environment then there is no need for extrapolating. 

 PROSECUTORS DON‚ÄôT WANT BANKMAN-FRIED‚ÄôS LAWYERS MENTIONING HIS
$500 MILLION INVESTMENT IN AI STARTUP ANTHROPIC (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/5eLJB?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Prosecutors want to prevent former FTX cofounder Sam
Bankman-Fried‚Äôs attorneys from mentioning his $500M investment in AI
startup Anthropic during trial, deeming it irrelevant. Meanwhile,
Anthropic, seen as a competitor to OpenAI, is seeking funding that
could propel its valuation to $20B-$30B, after recently securing a
$1.25B commitment from Amazon.
