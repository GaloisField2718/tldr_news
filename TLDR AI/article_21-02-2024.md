HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-4 KNOWLEDGE CUTOFF IS DECEMBER 2023 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 According to the new documentation on the OpenAI platform, the
training data for GPT-4 models has been updated to include information
up to December 2023. 

 SOFTBANK FOUNDER MASAYOSHI SON AIMS TO RAISE $100 BILLION FOR NEW
CHIP VENTURE (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp. is launching Izanagi, a $100
billion chip venture aimed at competing with Nvidia and focusing on AI
applications. 

 SCRIBE $25M SERIES B (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scribe has raised a Series B funding round led by Redpoint Ventures
to accelerate its AI-driven platform, which automates the creation of
visual step-by-step guides and facilitates knowledge sharing within
organizations. Over a million teams use Scribe, including 97% of the
Fortune 100. The company is expanding its AI features to make
workplace information even more accessible.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GENERATIVE REPRESENTATIONAL INSTRUCTION TUNING (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Contextual team has trained and released a model that both
generates text and embeddings. It dramatically outperforms single
specialist models. The model is an interesting take on the multi-modal
trend where the output modality is an embedding. 

 DEEPDIVE: MAMBA THE HARD WAY (30 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sasha Rush has released an annotated tutorial for accelerating Mamba
with custom Triton kernels. It doesn‚Äôt scale yet due to a bug in the
Triton compiler, but it is an extreme illustration of the technology
and great for those looking to dive deeper into the state space
Transformer alternative world. 

 ENHANCING FINE-TUNING WITH LORA+ (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper presents LoRA+, an advancement over the existing Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) method for fine-tuning large models. LoRA+ achieves
better performance and faster fine-tuning, without increasing
computational demands, by using different learning rates for key
components in the process.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TONIC TEXTUAL: NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION AND SYNTHESIS FOR
UNSTRUCTURED DATA (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Train your models with high-quality and realistic data, without
worrying about sensitive data leakage. Tonic Textual [11] provides
named entity recognition and sensitive data synthesis from free-text,
PDF, and Word documents [11]. Cleanse data of all sensitive
information, and use a few lines of SDK code to start working with
synthetic data in minutes. See how Tonic scans your text in real time
[11] 

 3D OBJECT FROM AS FEW AS 4 PICTURES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This repository allows you to take four images and turn them into a
high-quality 3d representation with Gaussian Splatting. 

 GENERATING IMAGES AT ANY RESOLUTION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Flexible Vision Transformer (FiT) is a novel architecture
designed to create images at any resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike
traditional models, FiT treats images as sequences of variable-sized
tokens, allowing it to adapt to different image sizes more effectively
during training and inference. 

 BOOSTING AI'S DEFENSE AGAINST ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project introduces a new method to strengthen multi-modal models
like OpenFlamingo and LLaVA against visual adversarial attacks. By
fine-tuning the CLIP vision encoder in an unsupervised manner, the
authors effectively shield these models from manipulative image
attacks, enhancing their reliability and security in real-world
applications without the need for retraining the entire model.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW LLM BENCHMARK (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Preeminent researcher Nicholas Carlini has released the benchmark he
uses for evaluating large language model performance. Interestingly,
it has GPT-4 further ahead than most other benchmarks. 

 STRATEGIES FOR AN ACCELERATING FUTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The recent advancements in AI, particularly with Google's Gemini
offering a context window of over a million tokens and Groq's hardware
enabling almost instantaneous responses from GPT-3.5 models, signify a
major leap forward in practical AI applications and underscore the
urgency for leaders to understand and adapt to AI's rapidly evolving
landscape. 

 HOW TO LOSE AT GENERATIVE AI (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Generative AI, while hyped, is likely to disappoint most startups
because it favors incumbents with data advantages, existing workflows,
and the ability to integrate AI into these systems without major
overhauls. Despite venture capital flowing into the GenAI space,
startups focusing on prompt engineering and UX improvements at the
workflow layer are essentially prepping the market for incumbents who
can easily adopt and integrate AI innovations into their dominant
platforms, suggesting a challenging path ahead for startups aiming to
capture significant value in the Generative AI domain.
