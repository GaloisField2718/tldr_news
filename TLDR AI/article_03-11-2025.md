 NEW VERSION OF SIRI TO 'LEAN' ON GOOGLE GEMINI (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A revamped version of Siri that uses a custom Gemini-based model is
expected to roll out in March next year. Google is reportedly
developing the model, which will run on Apple's Private Cloud Compute
servers to power Siri. Apple is reportedly running into problems with
the launch of Apple Intelligence in China. It is being mired by
regulatory issues, so the launch is now a rolling target. 

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS 'ENOUGH' TO QUESTIONS ABOUT OPENAI'S REVENUE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sam Altman grew testy when pressed about OpenAI's ability to fund
$1.4 trillion in committed spending, snapping at interviewer Brad
Gerstner with, "If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a
buyer". Altman said OpenAI is doing "well more" than the previously
reported $13 billion in annual revenue and suggested the company could
reach $100 billion by 2027, but denied rumors of an IPO in 2026. 

 FROM ILYA'S DEPOSITION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ilya Sutskever plotted for over a year with Mira Murati to remove Sam
Altman as OpenAI CEO. Dario Amondei wanted Greg Brockman fired and
himself in charge of all research. Murati told Sutskever that Altman
had pitted her against Daniela Amondei. Sutskever wrote a 52-page-long
memo to get Altman fired and also a separate document on Brockman.
OpenAI is paying Sutskever's legal bills.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY DO AI MODELS USE SO MANY EM-DASHES? (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Language models use em-dashes so much that real humans who like using
them have stopped out of fear of being confused with AI. It's
surprisingly hard to prompt models to avoid using em-dashes.
Researchers still don't really know why language models use them so
much. This article looks at some possible explanations. 

 AGENTS RULE OF TWO FOR AI SECURITY (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta has proposed the "Agents Rule of Two" to reduce prompt injection
risks in AI agents by limiting them to no more than two of three
capabilities in a session: handling untrusted inputs, accessing
private data, or taking external actions. 

 OCR MODELS EXPLAINED (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Recent advancements in OCR models, such as Chandra and Deepseek,
eliminate traditional scripting by using vision transformers that
convert raw pixels into semantic tokens. These models improve accuracy
by understanding and compressing visual data into concise tokens
before decoding them into text, allowing context-aware text
recognition. Deepseek-ocr achieves this efficiently with ~10x
compression, enabling flexible adaptation to different fonts and
handwriting styles without retraining.

 GHOSTS IN THE CODEX MACHINE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 After weeks of user reports claiming Codex had gotten worse, echoing
a perennial concern that frontier labs secretly downgrade their
models, OpenAI assembled a squad to investigate every possible culprit
and publish their findings. The team found no smoking gun, but instead
uncovered a catalog of small bugs: older hardware subtly dragging down
performance, a constrained sampling bug that made the model switch to
Korean mid-sentence, and context compaction that quietly degraded
accuracy in long conversations.

 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS GET ALL THE HYPE, BUT SMALL MODELS DO THE REAL
WORK (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Small language models are helping companies get real work done and
reduce headcount. They are more affordable than large language models
and, in some cases, better suited to the tasks at hand. The impact
that AI is having on corporate productivity gains is the result of
human engineers getting better at stitching together smaller, simpler
AIs. Many companies have built internal knowledge factories that daisy
chain together small AIs. 

 BILLBOARD SAYS AI-POWERED 'ARTISTS' ARE INCREASINGLY HITTING THE

 AI-generated musicians have debuted on Billboard charts each week for
the past month. One artist, Xania Monet, scored a No. 1 hit on the R&B
sales chart and a multimillion-dollar record deal.
