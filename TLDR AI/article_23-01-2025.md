 CONTEXTUAL AI INTRODUCES A BENCHMARK-BEATING PLATFORM FOR BUILDING
SPECIALIZED RAG AGENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 RAG isn't a solved problem. Building agents that can accurately
retrieve information from enterprise data stores still requires AI
teams to awkwardly cobble together different components, with accuracy
and stability far from guaranteed.

However, with the general availability of the Contextual AI Platform
[4], this is about to change:

 	* The platform enables teams to launch specialized RAG agents,
capable of active retrieval and test-time compute over massive volumes
of enterprise data.
 	* These agents deliver exceptional accuracy in technical, complex,
and knowledge-intensive workloads [4] (investment analysis,
engineering design support, technical research).
 	* In benchmarks, Contextual AI outperforms RAG systems built using
leading models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, in end-to-end
accuracy.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S STARGATE PROJECT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Stargate Project is a new company that intends to invest $500
billion over the next four years to build new AI infrastructure for
OpenAI in the United States. 

 MICROSOFT ENDS EXCLUSIVE CLOUD PARTNERSHIP WITH OPENAI (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Microsoft is no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider, signaling
broader opportunities for OpenAI to expand its partnerships with other
providers. 

 MORE TEENS SAY THEY'RE USING CHATGPT FOR SCHOOLWORK (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A Pew Research Center poll revealed that 26% of teens now use ChatGPT
for homework assistance, doubling last year's figure. Comfort with AI
use varies, with 54% accepting it for research but only 18% for essay
writing. While initial bans were imposed, many school districts have
eased restrictions on classroom AI use.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EFFICIENT BYTE LEVEL MODELS AT SCALE (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 EvaByte is a model from SambaNova trained on byte level language
modeling. It performs on par with models two generations old (e.g.,
Llama 2). While this may seem slightly disappointing, it is a big win
for byte level models, which have been stuck at sub 1B parameter scale
for some time. 

 TREAD: TOKEN ROUTING FOR EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURE-AGNOSTIC DIFFUSION
TRAINING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A novel approach to improved sample efficiency for Diffusion models
that doesn't involve modifications to the underlying architecture. 

 ML APPLICATIONS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICES (42 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A comprehensive review of machine learning applications in
archaeological practices. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MEDICAL REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MedSSS is a slow-thinking small medical language model built with a
self-evolution pipeline. 

 TOOL-USE BENCHMARK FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 MTU-Bench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' tool-use capabilities across various scenarios. 

 MMAUDIO (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MMAudio is a video-to-audio system that takes videos as input and
creates paired audio based on the video's content. It works well with
both synthetic and real videos.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE IS BUILDING ITS OWN ‘WORLD MODELING' AI TEAM FOR GAMES AND
ROBOT TRAINING (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google DeepMind is forming a team led by Tim Brooks to develop AI
"world models" for simulating physical environments. These models aim
to enhance real-time interactive media and training scenarios,
contributing to Google's pursuit of AGI. The initiative will
collaborate with existing Google AI projects like Gemini and Veo. 

 HARNESSING AI TO RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL THREAT OF ANTIMICROBIAL
RESISTANCE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AMR-Policy GPT is an AI tool that uses LLMs to aid in antimicrobial
resistance policy development across 146 countries. The tool provides
policymakers with contextually relevant information, fostering
better-informed National Action Plans, especially in regions lacking
local data or infrastructure. The project is co-led by academics from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Durham University. 

 WHAT'S NEXT FOR AI, AND STEM-CELL THERAPIES (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI predictions for 2025 include advancements in customized agents,
generative video, and versatile robots. Meta is dropping professional
fact-checkers, shifting responsibility to users, causing concern among
its former partners. MIT Technology Review has highlighted emerging
stem-cell therapies as one of ten breakthrough technologies for 2025.
