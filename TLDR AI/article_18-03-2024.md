HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPEN RELEASE OF GROK-1 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has released the weights and architecture of its 314 billion
parameter Mixture-of-Experts model, Grok-1. It is written in JAX and
uses a modern Transformer architecture with GeGLU, ROPE, sandwich
Norm, and other niceties. 

 DID OPENAI JUST ACCIDENTALLY LEAK THE NEXT BIG CHATGPT UPGRADE? (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI appears to have accidentally published a blog post that was
indexed by Bing and DuckDuckGo before it was quickly taken down. The
post was an announcement for GPT-4.5 Turbo, a new model that surpasses
GPT-4 Turbo in speed, accuracy, and scalability. The cached
description mentions a knowledge cutoff date of June 2024 and a 256k
context window. OpenAI has not commented on the leak. 

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE 3 HAIKU (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku is its fastest and most cost-effective AI

 WHAT I LEARNED LOOKING AT 900 MOST POPULAR OPEN SOURCE AI TOOLS (21
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 We can find some interesting trends by looking at GitHub stars for
popular AI models. Most open-source AI tooling seems to be focused on
infrastructure and applications. 

 CAPPY: OUTPERFORMING AND BOOSTING LARGE MULTI-TASK LANGUAGE MODELS
WITH A SMALL SCORER (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cappy is a small model trained to take instructions and a candidate
completion and return a score for how well the completion fulfills the
instructions. It outperforms much larger models at this task,
suggesting it may be used as a feedback mechanism for training and
generation. 

 3D HUMAN POSE RECONSTRUCTION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (3 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 ScoreHMR introduces a novel method for 3D human pose and shape
reconstruction by leveraging the power of diffusion models. This
approach, which bypasses traditional optimization techniques, uses
score guidance to align a human body model with image observations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLM INFERENCE SPEED OF LIGHT (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Exploring the "speed of light" theoretical limit for
transformer-based language model inference, this article highlights
the importance of memory bandwidth over computational power,
demonstrating that inference speed is primarily constrained by the
ability to read data from memory rather than perform calculations, a
key factor for optimizing and understanding AI performance. 

 AI IS BAD/GOOD ACTUALLY (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The author of this article proposes differentiating AI discussions by
using terms like "harmful," "helpful," "capable," and "incapable"
rather than the vague good/bad spectrum. They personally view AI as
capable but potentially harmful due to unresolved issues such as
copyright infringement and bias exaggeration. The author invites
readers to clarify their own positions on AI using these more specific
terms. 

 MY KIDS WILL FANCY GENERATIVE AI, I CHOOSE TO FIGHT IT (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This article reflects on the historical pattern of technological
innovations impacting jobs, with the rise of AI being the latest
example. It compares past shifts, like the advent of writing,
printing, and typewriters, to the current AI revolution, pondering
whether AI will ultimately enhance or diminish human creativity. The
author calls for resistance and adaptation to preserve the uniquely
human element in creative endeavors amidst the growing influence of
AI-generated content.
