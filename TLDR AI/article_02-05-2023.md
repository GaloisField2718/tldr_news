HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

GODFATHER OF AI LEAVES GOOGLE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/DlNpR?utm_source=tldrai] 

While the content of this piece is a bit sensationalized, the fact
that Dr. Hinton has left Google is notable. He claimed, on Twitter,
that his goal was to distance himself from Google so he could speak
more openly about the potential harms of AI. He claims his previous
employer acted responsibly with AI product releases. 

STABILITY AI RELEASES DEEPFLOYD IF (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://stability.ai/blog/deepfloyd-if-text-to-image-model?utm_source=tldrai]


Stability AI has released DeepFloyd, an innovative text-to-image
model, which leverages AI to transform textual descriptions into
detailed and vivid images, opening up new possibilities in digital art
and design. 

THE ‚ÄòDON‚ÄôT LOOK UP‚Äô THINKING THAT COULD DOOM US WITH AI (10
MINUTE READ)
[https://time.com/6273743/thinking-that-could-doom-us-with-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


This Time magazine piece explores certain mindsets and assumptions
that could potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes with AI,
emphasizing the importance of responsible AI development and use, as
well as the need for thoughtful regulation and ethical considerations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

OPEN GPT MODEL TUNED FOR MEDICAL DATA (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14454v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

Llama is a language model from Meta that was released under a mostly
open license. It was trained for much longer than GPT-3 and even
longer than was optimally suggested by Deepmind‚Äôs Chinchilla. It
does ok on medical tasks, but when tuned more scores improve by 30%+.
Lots of folks have been talking about Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning
which only updates a fraction of the underlying model. This paper
shows that while it is cheaper to use PEFT, performance is sometimes
significantly worse. 

DIFFUSION MODEL WITH CONSTRAINTS (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05364?utm_source=tldrai] 

Diffusion models are a class of machine learning models that learn to
slowly remove noise from data to produce high quality output. The
Stable Diffusion text-to-image model is an example of such a model.
One challenge with these models is setting constraints on the output
(imagine an application where you only want to use blue pixels). This
paper introduces an inequality constraint on the output so that you
can produce diffusion paths for anything within the approved region.
They showcase examples of diffusion models for biomedical applications
where constraints are extremely tight. 

SYNTHETIC DATA FROM DIFFUSION MODELS IMPROVES IMAGENET CLASSIFICATION
(13 MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08466?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper explores the potential of using large-scale text-to-image
diffusion models for generative data augmentation to improve
challenging discriminative tasks. The study shows that fine-tuned
class-conditional models generated by these models have
state-of-the-art FID, Inception Score, and Classification Accuracy
Scores. Augmenting the ImageNet training set with samples from the
generated models results in significant improvements in ImageNet
classification accuracy over strong ResNet and Vision Transformer
baselines.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

NEUTRALSPEECH2 (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://speechresearch.github.io/naturalspeech2/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Natural Speech 2 project aims to advance the state of the art in
speech recognition by developing new algorithms and models that are
better equipped to handle the inherent complexities and nuances of
human speech, ultimately improving the performance and usability of
speech-based AI systems. 

WHISPER 70X FASTER (HUGGINGFACE)
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax?utm_source=tldrai]


Now running in Jax, this version of whisper can transcribe 1hr of
audio in mere seconds. The underlying model is already one of the most
powerful speech to text systems out there - now it‚Äôs almost a
no-brainer given the speed. There are still drawbacks, but this is an
excellent result from the community. 

GODOT-DODO (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/minosvasilias/godot-dodo?utm_source=tldrai] 

The godot-dodo project presents a pipeline to finetune open source
language models on human-created, language-specific code retrieved
from GitHub.

THE FUTURE OF GENERATIVE AI IS NICHE, NOT GENERALIZED (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/27/1072102/the-future-of-generative-ai-is-niche-not-generalized/?utm_source=tldrai]


MIT Technology Review suggests that the future of generative AI will
likely be niche-specific rather than generalized, pointing to the
increasing demand for customized AI solutions tailored to specific
industries or applications, and the limitations of current
one-size-fits-all AI models in addressing unique and diverse needs.

Sydney Morning Herald reports on Beijing's initiative to compel AI
bots to uphold and display "socialist core values," a move that
underscores the Chinese government's effort to align technological
advancements with its political ideology and societal norms.

MORE AI MIND READING (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techxplore.com/news/2023-05-scientists-brain-scans-ai-decode.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Scientists have been using AI to decode images directly from brain
scans, according to a report on TechXplore. This cutting-edge research
could lead to significant advancements in neuroscience, particularly
in understanding how our brains process visual information. The
technology uses machine learning models to predict the images that
people are seeing based purely on their brain activity, which is
measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This
could have profound implications for the fields of artificial
intelligence and neuroscience.
