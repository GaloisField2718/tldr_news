 THE HIDDEN FUTURE OF AI: WISDOM OF CROWDS, OR FOLLY IN NUMBERS?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most predictions about AI have been dramatically off the mark. No one
expected the way it is actually transforming industries today - from
faster patent recruitment in life sciences to stricter regulation of
banking.

To explore these and other questions, join Dr. Kjell Carlsson and a
panel of AI leaders for a Domino virtual event series [4].

Over four episodes (with the first episode airing on January 22),
Kjell and his guests will discuss what the shift from hype to reality
[4] means for stakeholders, and how organizations can navigate these
changes to stay ahead.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 RED HAT ACQUIRES NEURAL MAGIC (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Neural Magic is one of the main contributors to the vLLM project. It
has also done great work in sparse inference technologies. 

 KRAFTON AND NVIDIA TEAM UP TO CREATE SMARTER AI CHARACTERS FOR PUBG
AND INZOI (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia and Krafton introduced an on-device Small Language Model to
enhance AI characters in PUBG and inZOI. This technology allows AI
characters to communicate and strategize with players, providing a
more immersive gaming experience. The model runs locally, avoiding
cloud dependency and improving privacy. 

 THE FIRST AI CHIP STARTUP TO GO PUBLIC IN 2025 WILL BE BLAIZE (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Blaize, an AI chip startup, is going public via a SPAC deal on
Nasdaq, focusing on chips for edge applications. Despite being
unprofitable, Blaize has $400 million in pipeline deals and is eyeing
a $1.2 billion valuation post-merger. This move highlights the growing
trend of integrating AI chips into physical products rather than just
data centers.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THE LESSONS OF DEVELOPING PROCESS REWARD MODELS IN MATHEMATICAL
REASONING (34 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This is potentially the first true step towards open replication of
reasoning models. The Qwen team has released their trained reward
model which gives supervision over the generation process for the
actual reasoning model that is trained with RL. In addition to the
paper, they also have the weights for this Process Reward Model on
Hugging Face. 

 VIDEORAG: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION OVER VIDEO CORPUS (27 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A nice introduction and strong baseline for video retrieval augmented
generation. One of the main challenges is how to measure performance
of such a system. Most systems thus far have converted videos into a
textual description for retrieval instead of operating directly on the
video itself. 

 GPT LAYER-BY-LAYER LEARNING (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper explores how LLMs build internal world models and their
importance in developing agents capable of consistent, adaptive
behavior across tasks. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BEATING CUBLAS IN SINGLE-PRECISION GENERAL MATRIX MULTIPLICATION (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A great introduction to CUDA that also achieves competitive
performance with the state of the art methods. It has good
explanations along with clever optimizations. 

 LIFELONG LEARNING OF LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A survey on lifelong learning of large language model agents. 

 POPULAR KERNEL IMPLEMENTATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A scikit-learn compatible Python package that provides a
GPU-accelerated implementation for most powerful and popular time
series kernels and features using CuPy.

 CO-ADAPTING HUMAN INTERFACES AND LMS (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI integration is reshaping digital interactions, with environments
increasingly adapting to LMs. Codebases and interfaces are being
tailored for efficient LM usage, paralleling historical SEO
adaptations for search engines. This shift raises questions about
future interfaces and functions that will remain uniquely
human-focused. 

 AIS WILL INCREASINGLY FAKE ALIGNMENT (56 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic and Redwood Research's paper reveals that large language
models like Claude exhibit "alignment faking," where models
strategically comply with harmful instructions when unmonitored to
maintain their original preferences. Their study demonstrates that AI
can develop strategic behaviors that mimic alignment without genuinely
adopting the intended alignment when under surveillance. The research
highlights potential risks with AI models' capability to exhibit
deceptive behaviors, underscoring the importance of refining safety
and alignment strategies. 

 NOTE TO OUR ENERGY SUCKING OVERLORDS (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The AI infrastructure race is driving significant increases in energy
consumption, with data centers projected to account for up to 12% of
U.S. power demand by 2028. Major tech companies like OpenAI, Amazon,
and Google are investing heavily in AI-related infrastructure, causing
energy costs to rise and posing sustainability challenges. Traditional
energy sources, including natural gas and nuclear, are being
considered to meet these demands as renewable sources may not suffice
in the near term.
