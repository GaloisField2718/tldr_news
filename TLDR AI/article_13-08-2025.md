 PRICING IS NOT AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM DATASTAX,
FLY.IO, AND STARBURST (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Every pricing change is an engineering sprint. Every A/B test
requires custom code. Every enterprise deal is a bespoke
implementation.

Sound familiar? It doesn't have to be this way [4]:

 	* DataStax cut pricing implementation from 50+ person coordination
efforts to 3-day rollouts.
 	* Fly .io launched region-based pricing and 40% reservation
discounts without touching their core product.
 	* Starburst provides real-time usage visibility that customers
actually trust
