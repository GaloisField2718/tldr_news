players, Meta has a custom chip for AI inference workloads. The 7nm
chip has reduced power consumption and matches speed compared to many
alternative pieces of hardware. 

NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS REMOVE CHATGPT BAN (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/chatgpt-ban-dropped-new-york-city-public-schools-rcna85089?utm_source=tldrai]


The New York City Department of Education will lift its ban on
OpenAI's popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT, previously banned due to
concerns over potential misuse and cheating by students. In an op-ed,
the Chancellor of New York City Public Schools, David Banks, noted
that initial caution has shifted towards exploration of the tool's
potential for supporting students and teachers. Going forward,
educators will be provided with resources and examples of successful
AI implementations to improve tasks and teaching. This decision
underscores the growing importance of AI literacy for students
preparing for the future job market.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

A SUPER LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR: THE MLONGT5 STORY (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11129?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers built a powerful tool called mLongT5 that can understand
and translate long texts in multiple languages. It outperforms other
similar tools in tasks like summarizing text and answering questions
in various languages. 

DRAGGAN: A USER-INTERACTIVE METHOD FOR IMAGE MANIPULATION (3 MINUTE
READ)
[https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DragGAN/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers have developed a tool named DragGAN, which allows users to
modify images precisely by dragging any point in the image to a target
location, enabling changes in pose, shape, expression, and layout. It
outperforms existing image manipulation methods, proving its
efficiency not only in creating realistic results but also in tracking
changes, even when manipulating real images. 

BOOSTING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH REAL-WORLD KNOWLEDGE: THE NEW
FINE-TUNING APPROACH (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626?utm_source=tldrai] 

Authors have designed a new way to teach language models to understand
and plan in the real world by using a virtual simulator to give them
'embodied experiences.' This new method significantly improves the
models' abilities and makes smaller models perform as well as, or even
better than, larger models like ChatGPT.

ONE-PEACE: AN ALL-ROUNDER MODEL FOR VISION, AUDIO, AND LANGUAGE TASKS
(GITHUB REPO) [https://github.com/OFA-Sys/ONE-PEACE?utm_source=tldrai]


ONE-PEACE is a new model that excels in understanding images, sounds,
and words, without needing to start from a pre-trained model, and it
performs exceptionally in tasks involving vision, audio, and language.
It also has a unique feature that allows it to find connections
between different types of data it hasn't seen together before, and
its flexible structure means it could be used with many more types of
data in the future. 

SUPERAGENT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/homanp/superagent?utm_source=tldrai] 

SuperAgent is a powerful tool that simplifies the configuration and
deployment of LLM (Large Language Model) Agents to production. 

4 BIT NORMAL FLOAT IN HUGGINGFACE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/23479?utm_source=tldrai]


Quantization reduces the precision of numbers in a model. This makes
them take much less space in hardware. It's been typically reserved
for inference. This new research allows one to fine-tune 65B parameter
models in commodity hardware. This is a breakthrough in training
quantization.

DATA IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://pivotal.substack.com/p/data-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=tldrai]


Abraham Thomas emphasizes the critical role of data in the age of AI.
He discusses the increasing need for well-managed, high-quality data
to train and optimize AI models. Furthermore, he elaborates on the
data flywheel effect, where the more data you collect and use, the
better your AI model can become, leading to enhanced products and
services and attracting more users, thus generating more data.
