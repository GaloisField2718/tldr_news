 10 QUESTIONS TO ASK BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AI-RELATED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Powerful AI tools are so readily available today that it's tempting
to jump right in. But in the enterprise gaining consensus and momentum
will help keep your AI initiative going, even after initial enthusiasm
wanes.

Grab a copy of this starter guide by Dell and NVIDIA [4] will help you
prepare for and facilitate productive AI discussion between technical
and nontechnical teams. It covers 10 questions that will help
“right-size” AI for your business [4] — and how different teams
can work together to answer them.

 PERPLEXITY LAUNCHES A $200 MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION PLAN (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Perplexity Max offers unlimited access to Labs, a report-generating
tool, and early access to Comet, its forthcoming AI-powered browser. 

 ORACLE, OPENAI EXPAND STARGATE DEAL FOR MORE US DATA CENTERS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI will rent 4.5 gigawatts of data center power from Oracle
across multiple US states - enough electricity to power millions of
homes - as part of a $30 billion cloud deal as part of the $500
billion Stargate initiative. 

 COULD GOOGLE'S VEO 3 BE THE START OF PLAYABLE WORLD MODELS? (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Google's latest video-generating model, Veo 3, could potentially be
used for video games. World models are different from video-generation
models - video-generation models synthesize realistic video sequences
while world models simulate the dynamics of real-world environments.
Veo 3 isn't quite a world model yet, but it could be used for
cinematic storytelling and narrative prototyping. Google has plans to
turn its multimodal foundation model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, into a world
model.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI MODELS REQUIRING $10M+ TO TRAIN NOW LAUNCH TWICE PER MONTH (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Epoch AI tracked 201 models exceeding 10²³ FLOPs in 2024, up from
just two in 2017, with training costs for the largest models now
reaching tens of millions of dollars at the 10²⁵ FLOP threshold
first crossed by GPT-4. 

 BUILDING REWARD FUNCTIONS FOR CHEMICAL AI: A TALE OF REWARD HACKING
(14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FutureHouse researchers detail the months-long battle against their
chemistry reasoning model, ether0, which kept finding creative ways to
game their reward systems—from proposing reactions that just "add
water and call it a reaction" to generating explosive peroxide chains.
Their iterative fixes using bloom filters and structure alerts reveal
why domain expertise, not just ML engineering, has become critical for
training reasoning models.

 OPTIMIZING CHECKPOINTING WITH PYTORCH DCP (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 PyTorch engineers reduced checkpoint sizes by 22% using a modular
compression approach in Distributed Checkpointing (DCP). This post
outlines practical integration steps and design choices to streamline
storage and bandwidth during distributed training. 

 GEMINI 2.5 FOR ROBOTICS AND EMBODIED INTELLIGENCE (11 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Gemini 2.5 models advance robotics with enhanced coding, reasoning,
and multimodal capabilities rooted in spatial understanding.
Developers can use Gemini 2.5 for complex scene queries, robot control
through spatial reasoning, and interactive applications using the Live
API for real-time voice commands. Trusted testers like Boston Dynamics
showcase its potential in robotics. 

 GNNS WITH TRANSFORMERS FOR NEURAL PREDICTORS (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A new predictor combines GNNs and transformers with a sibling-aware
token mixer and a bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network
to better model DAG-based neural architectures. 

 GRAPH REGRESSION WITH CONTRASTIVE LEARNING (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Extending causal graph learning techniques to regression tasks, this
work adapts intervention strategies via contrastive learning to better
handle confounders in graph-level regression.

 THE PATH TO MEDICAL SUPERINTELLIGENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft AI's Diagnostic Orchestrator beats expert physicians by
diagnosing 85% of New England Journal of Medicine cases four times
more accurately. It achieved this faster and more cost-effectively
through sequential diagnosis, mimicking real-world clinical
decision-making. This advancement is supported by Microsoft AI's new
Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms complex medical cases
into interactive diagnostic challenges. 

 NYT TO START SEARCHING DELETED CHATGPT LOGS AFTER BEATING OPENAI IN
COURT (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's request to overturn a court order requiring it to retain all
ChatGPT logs 'indefinitely' has been denied. The company's user
agreement specifies that its data can be retained as part of legal
processes. OpenAI plans to keep fighting the order, but it seems to
have few options left. In the meantime, it is negotiating a process
that will allow news plaintiffs to search through the retained data.
