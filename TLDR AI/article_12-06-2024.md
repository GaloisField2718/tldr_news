 ELON DROPS LAWSUIT AGAINST OPENAI (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk has dropped the lawsuit against OpenAI and Sam Altman that
claims they have deviated from their original mission in favor of
profit. He has the option to file again in the future. 

 TOGETHER MIXTURE OF AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Together has introduced Mixture of Agents (MoA), a novel method that
combines multiple LLMs for superior performance that achieves a 65.1%
score on AlpacaEval 2.0, surpassing GPT-4o. MoA uses a layered
structure where initial responses from various models are refined by
aggregators in successive layers, enhancing output quality through
collaboration. Despite higher accuracy, MoA faces latency challenges.
Future directions include optimizing model architecture and reducing
latency.
