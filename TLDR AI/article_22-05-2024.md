multimodal inputs, allowing users to upload photos and receive
text-based answers. 

 MICROSOFT WANTS TO MAKE WINDOWS AN AI OPERATING SYSTEM, LAUNCHES
COPILOT PLUS PCS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article rounds up all of the major announcements Microsoft just

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PHI-3 14B (HUGGING FACE HUB) [9] 

 The powerful small series of models got an upgrade with the 14B
version. It performs on par with Command R (a 104B model). 

 DICTIONARY LEARNING ON CLAUDE SONNET (35 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Anthropic has made a breakthrough in mechanistic interpretability by
mapping millions of concepts inside of Sonnet. It even found that you
could push on the internal concepts and change Sonnet's sense of self
(e.g., researchers made it believe it was the Golden Gate Bridge). 

 TEXT CLASSIFICATION WITH LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Smart Expert System is a new approach using Large Language Models
(LLMs) for text classification. This system streamlines the process by
reducing the need for extensive preprocessing and domain expertise.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 OCTOAI OUTPERFORMS VLLM FOR SELF-HOSTED GENAI (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Open source LLMs like Llama 3 and Mixtral are game-changing. But
getting them to run efficiently on vLLM requires a ton of manual
optimizations. OctoStack [12] from OctoAI achieves better throughput,
lower latency, and efficient GPU utilization by baking the latest
optimization techniques into an inference stack you control. Read the
blog for all the juicy technical details! [12] 

 ENHANCED VIDEO SUMMARIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project introduces a novel CNN-based SpatioTemporal Attention
(CSTA) method to improve video summarization. Unlike traditional
attention mechanisms, CSTA effectively captures the visual
significance of frames using a 2D CNN to understand relationships and
key attributes in videos. 

 DEBIASING VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project identifies a critical bias in Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), where outputs lean more towards language model priors
than actual visual inputs. The project effectively reduces this bias
by introducing "calibration" and "debias sampling" techniques, leading
to more accurate and vision-focused responses across various tasks. 

 A VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL FOR REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[15] 

 DeepSeek-VL is a new open-source Vision-Language Model tailored for
real-world uses with an emphasis on diverse data from web screenshots
to charts and OCR.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHATGPT CAN TALK, BUT OPENAI EMPLOYEES SURE CAN'T (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The departures of Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike have brought to light
OpenAI's restrictive NDA, which prevents former employees from
criticizing OpenAI under threat of losing their vested equity. CEO Sam
Altman responded to the story by promising a fix. 

 APPLE ANNOUNCES NEW ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES, INCLUDING EYE TRACKING (9
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Apple has announced upcoming accessibility features leveraging AI and
machine learning, such as Eye Tracking for iPad, iPhone navigation
using the front-facing camera, and Vocal Shortcuts that enable Siri to
execute tasks via custom sounds. Other upcoming features include Music
Haptics for tactile music feedback and advanced speech recognition for
atypical speech patterns. 

 ASK HN: IF YOU'VE USED GPT-4-TURBO AND CLAUDE OPUS, WHICH DO YOU
PREFER? (HACKER NEWS THREAD) [18] 

 This Hacker News thread compares GPT-4-Turbo, the default model in
ChatGPT Plus, to Claude Opus, Anthropic's competing model. Most
developers seem to prefer Claude as it is apparently better at coding
and engineering work. Its writing style also seems to be preferred,
but part of that is due to the recognizability of GPT-4-Turbo's style.
OpenAI's app functionalities, like its code interpreter and ability to
search the internet, are still big reasons to continue using ChatGPT
Plus.
