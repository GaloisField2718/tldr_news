HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COGNITION LAUNCHES THEIR AI SOFTWARE ENGINEER DEVIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Cognition announced a new system called Devin that scores 14% on
SWE-Bench, a challenging benchmark that tests AI‚Äôs abilities to
write code. GPT-4 scored 1.7%. This model shows strong in-context
learning abilities. 

 DETAILS ON 24K H100S AT META (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This blog post from Meta outlines the infrastructure being used to
train Llama 3. It talks through storage, networking, Pytorch, NCCL,
and other improvements. This will lay the foundation for Meta's H100s
coming online throughout the rest of this year. 

 PHYSICAL INTELLIGENCE IS BUILDING A BRAIN FOR ROBOTS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Physical Intelligence (Pi) has emerged from stealth with $70 million
in seed funding. The company, founded by a team of renowned robotics
and AI experts, aims to develop foundation models and learning
algorithms that can power a wide range of robots and
physically-actuated devices.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 STEALING PART OF A PRODUCTION LANGUAGE MODEL (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 You can steal portions of closed language models such as the
embeddings layer just by using their public APIs. This can be done for
a modest budget of less than $2,000. 

 MAMBA BASED DNA SEQUENCE MODEL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A sequence prediction model for DNA built on the Transformer
competitor Mamba. It is extremely efficient and powerful for a small
model. 

 3D GENERATION WITH VIDEO DIFFUSION MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This project introduces a novel approach that enhances 3D object
generation, producing high-quality, detailed objects from a single
image.

 DATAGPT: CHAT WITH YOUR DATA AND GET ANALYST-QUALITY ANSWERS IN
SECONDS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 DataGPT is your on-demand, always available data analyst. From simple
reporting to cohort and trend analysis [11], DataGPT gives reliable,
thorough, and accurate answers to natural language questions like
‚Äúwhy did our conversions drop?‚Äù
üÜï¬†Use Dynamic Benchmarking [11] to compare two segments in your
data, including from different starting dates.

Let DataGPT crunch the numbers for you [11]

 OPENAI TRANSFORMER DEBUGGER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Transformer Debugger is a tool developed by OpenAI's Superalignment
team to support investigations into specific behaviors of small
language models. The tool combines automated interpretability
techniques with sparse autoencoders. 

 VIDEOMAMBA RELEASED ALL CODES AND MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VideoMamba is a solution that addresses the complexities of video
understanding by efficiently managing local redundancy and global
dependencies. 

 MAKING VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS MORE EFFICIENT WITH FASTV (GITHUB REPO)
[14] 

 This project presents a way to improve the efficiency of Large
Vision-Language Models like LLaVA-1.5, QwenVL-Chat, and Video-LLaVA by
addressing the "inefficient attention" problem. Its use of FastV, a
new method that optimizes these models by pruning visual tokens and
learning adaptive attention patterns, leads to a significant reduction
in computational costs without losing performance on tasks related to
images and videos.

 RESEARCHERS CREATE AI WORMS THAT CAN SPREAD FROM ONE SYSTEM TO
ANOTHER (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers have created a generative AI worm called Morris II that
can attack AI systems like ChatGPT, spreading autonomously while
potentially stealing data. The worm uses ‚Äúadversarial
self-replicating prompts‚Äù to perpetuate and compromise AI email
assistants, highlighting new cyberattack risks within the AI
ecosystem. Security experts urge AI developers to take potential
AI-driven threats seriously as AI applications become more autonomous
and interconnected. 

 THE FUTURE OF POETRY (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 38 AI experts and 39 English experts were asked to rate and guess
whether poems were written by an AI or a human. The human came in 1st
place, while Bard, ChatGPT-4, and Claude came in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
places respectively, both in writing quality and their ability to fool
respondents into believing their poems were authored by a human.
English experts were far better at discerning which poems were written
by AI, which points to a need for them to play a greater role in
helping shape future versions of AI technology. 

 BARACK OBAMA ON AI, FREE SPEECH, AND THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET (27
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In a discussion about the need for AI regulation and transparent
development practices with tech companies, Former President Barack
Obama highlighted AI's potential risks and rewards and urged tech
experts to engage in government roles to help shape thoughtful AI
policies. The conversation also tackled First Amendment challenges and
the necessity of a multi-faceted, adaptive regulatory approach for AI.
