 AI IS ALREADY SOLVING REAL CYBERSECURITY PROBLEMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While some are worried about the use of AI in cyberattacks, Orca
Security is using it to build better defenses. This blog post [4]
shows how AI-powered security enables companies to:

 	* Navigate complex cloud environments by generating specific
remediation instructions and code [4] to mitigate cloud risks.
 	* Stay ahead of attackers with AI-powered search that helps
organizations understand which assets are vulnerable within minutes
[4] of a vulnerability being found.
 	* Tackle industry skills shortages [4] by simplifying tasks,
lowering skill thresholds, and suggesting optimal configurations.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 CAN WE TRUST VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS? (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Vision-enabled language models (VLMs) like GPT-4o and Gemini power
autonomous agents capable of tasks such as making purchases or editing
code. This work highlights the vulnerability of these agents to
malicious attacks. 

 EVALUATING WEB AGENTS IN REAL-TIME (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 WebCanvas is a new framework for evaluating autonomous web agents in
dynamic, live web environments. 

 94% ACCURACY ON CIFAR-10 IN 3.29 SECONDS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CIFAR-10 is an image classification benchmark. This code provides a
training configuration that achieves good performance in an amazingly
short time.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TIME SERIES FORECASTING WITH TIMESIEVE (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TimeSieve is a new model designed to tackle common challenges in time
series forecasting. 

 COST OF SELF-HOSTING LLAMA-3 8B-INSTRUCT (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Self-hosting an LLM like Llama-3 8B-Instruct can be significantly
more expensive than using ChatGPT, costing around $17 per million
tokens compared to ChatGPT's $1 per million tokens. The cost of
self-hosted hardware can be reduced to less than $0.01 per million
tokens, though it would take approximately 5.5 years to break even on
the initial investment.
