HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 THE INTELLIGENCE AGE (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI is poised to amplify human capabilities, enabling tasks that seem
unimaginable today. Through deep learning and increased computational
resources, AI will offer advancements like personal assistants,
educational tutors, and healthcare advisors. The focus must remain on
making AI accessible and mitigating its risks, paving the way for
widespread prosperity in the Intelligence Age. 

 APPLE NOT INVESTING IN OPENAI AFTER ALL, NEW REPORT SAYS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple has opted out of investing in OpenAI's $6.5 billion funding
round, leaving Microsoft and Nvidia as potential investors. Microsoft
is reportedly expanding its investment in OpenAI by another $1
billion. Despite not investing, Apple and OpenAI are partnering to
integrate ChatGPT into iOS 18. 

 HOW ALPHACHIP TRANSFORMED COMPUTER CHIP DESIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AlphaChip is a reinforcement learning model that significantly
accelerates and optimizes chip design processes. It generates
superhuman chip layouts, currently used in Google's TPUs, in hours
rather than weeks. This AI-driven method has broad applications,
influencing both Google's hardware and external organizations like
MediaTek.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 A FASTER SUCCESSOR TO RNNS (36 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Parallel Gated Network (PGN) is a novel architecture designed to
overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in handling long-term
dependencies. It reduces the information propagation path and uses
gated mechanisms to effectively capture historical and current time
step information. 

 FASTER IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DoSSR is a diffusion-based super-resolution model that enhances both
performance and efficiency by leveraging pretrained diffusion models
and starting the process with low-resolution images. 

 FASTER SAMPLING FOR FLOW-BASED MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 FlowTurbo is a technique designed to speed up sampling in flow-based
models without sacrificing quality.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 REACH DEVELOPERS, AI/ML ENGINEERS, AND AI ENTHUSIASTS WITH TLDR
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Paragon's Growth Marketing Manager mentions ‚ÄúTLDR allows us to
connect with engineers who aren't on social media‚Ä¶Our CTO reads TLDR
but doesn't scroll LinkedIn. ‚Äù

TLDR offers 10 interest-based newsletters to help you reach your
target audience. Learn more [10] about running your first campaign

 SOUND EVENT DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository introduces the Prototype-based Masked Audio Model,
which improves sound event detection by making better use of unlabeled
data. This technique generates pseudo labels using a Gaussian mixture
model to guide the training of a Transformer-based audio model. 

 EFFICIENT LOW-BIT QUANTIZATION FOR LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Vector Post-Training Quantization is a method designed to enable
extremely low-bit quantization of large language models, optimizing
memory and storage use during deployment. 

 FAST AND PHOTOREALISTIC HEAD AVATARS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LightAvatar is a head avatar model that improves rendering speed and
efficiency using neural light fields (NeLFs).

MISCELLANEOUS

 SEPARATING CODE REASONING AND EDITING (17 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Aider has been able to dramatically improve the performance of
general-purpose code editing by using o1 as an architect and DeepSeek
as the writer. 

 MILITARY LANGUAGE MODEL (HUGGING FACE HUB) [15] 

 This model was trained on army handbooks and has integrated deep
knowledge that is rare for fine-tuned models. 

 DEVELOPING A GO BOT EMBEDDING ICHIBAN PROLOG (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ichiban Prolog was embedded into Hellabot, a Go-based IRC bot, to
avoid recompilation for new triggers. This integration allows for
dynamic Prolog code execution, enabling users to modify bot logic
on-the-fly. Future improvements could reduce interpreter setup impact
and move more logic into Prolog.
