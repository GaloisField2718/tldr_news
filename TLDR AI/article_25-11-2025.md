 1PASSWORD WEBINAR: SECURITY IN THE AGE OF AI AGENTS AND SHADOW IT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In the age of AI and SaaS, IT and security leaders are confronting a
new reality. Productivity and innovation are racing ahead, and legacy
security tools are struggling to keep up.

1Password invites you to a panel on December 2nd, with CISOs from
Oracle Red Bull Racing, Headway, and Brex [4]. Together, they'll share
how they're tackling the new era of access risk. Registrants will hear
practical, real-world strategies to govern AI use, manage SaaS sprawl,
and extend access security beyond the limits of SSO.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING CLAUDE OPUS 4.5 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Claude Opus 4.5 is the first model to exceed 80% on SWE-bench
Verified. It achieves state-of-the-art results across coding, tool
use, and reasoning benchmarks. The model is priced at $5/$25 per
million tokens, down from previous Opus pricing. It includes a new
"effort" parameter letting developers trade speed for capability,
automatic context compression enabling unlimited conversation length,
and expanded availability for Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel. 

 INTRODUCING SHOPPING RESEARCH IN CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Just in time for the holidays, OpenAI launched an interactive product
discovery feature that searches the web, asks clarifying questions,
and generates personalized buyer's guides. Users can guide research in
real-time by marking products "Not interested" or "More like this."
The system draws on ChatGPT memory for personalization. It's powered
by a GPT-5 mini model trained specifically on shopping tasks.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 NANO BANANA-PILLED, NANO BANANA-SHILLED FOR SPACESHIP ENGINEERING (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nano Banana Pro can make good diagrams based on papers. It can also
make pretty good presentations, even on the free tier. This post
presents some examples of what happens when you feed the model essays
on spaceship engineering. While the facts within the slides still need
to be verified, it is clear that the technology is trending towards
something impressive - it can only get better from here. 

 A TSUNAMI OF COGS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI industry is in correction mode. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cursor
are subsidizing demand with negative margins. Google was surprised by
the AI boom, and it took a while for it to get its act together, but
it is now coming back strong. Its pockets are full, and it is better
positioned to play the negative margin game. If challengers don't want
to drown in a tsunami of costs, something has to change. 

 UNIVERSAL LLM MEMORY DOES NOT EXIST (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Semantic memory tracks preferences, long-term history, and rapport.
Working memory tracks file paths, variable names, and immediate error
logs. Semantic memory is brilliant for personalization across
sessions, but bad for execution state within a task. Treat semantic
memory and working memory as separate systems with separate
requirements.

measure, model, and maximize AI impact. Get clear KPIs, four ROI
formulas, and a You.com [10]-tested LLM prompt for quickly creating

 INTRODUCING ADVANCED TOOL USE ON THE CLAUDE DEVELOPER PLATFORM (14
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic released three beta features for developers. Tool Search
Tool discovers tools on demand rather than loading all definitions
upfront, reducing token consumption by 85%. Programmatic Tool Calling
lets Claude orchestrate multiple tools through Python code instead of
individual API calls, cutting token usage 37%. Tool Use Examples
provides concrete usage patterns beyond JSON schemas, improving
accuracy from 72%-90% on complex parameter handling. 

 BUILDING AN AI-NATIVE ENGINEERING TEAM (20 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI coding agents are revolutionizing the software development
lifecycle by managing tasks from scoping and prototyping to
implementation and operational triage, allowing engineers to focus on
architecture and product intent. These agents now sustain multi-hour
reasoning, effectively contributing across planning, design,
development, testing, code reviews, and deployment. Teams that adopt
coding agents for well-defined tasks can achieve faster delivery and
improved efficiency without drastically altering existing workflows.

 TAKING JAGGEDNESS SERIOUSLY (25 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Uneven capability advances in AI will persist because some tasks have
clear, verifiable rewards that can be used in reinforcement learning,
but most real work doesn't. Most work requires gathering and
synthesizing information across different systems and human
relationships. Organizations redesigning workflows around AI's
strongest current capabilities will gain power over those waiting for
the industry's promised "drop-in remote worker" that can handle
everything. 

 AI MEETS AGGRESSIVE ACCOUNTING AT META'S GIGANTIC NEW DATA CENTER (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta is building a $27 billion data center financed with debt.
Neither the data center nor the debt will be on its own balance
sheet. Meta will rent the data center for up to 20 years, beginning
in 2029, starting with a four-year lease term with options to renew
every four years. The lease structure minimizes the lease liabilities
and related assets that Meta will recognize.
