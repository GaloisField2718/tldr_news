 MONETIZE AI WITH FULL PRICING FLEXIBILITY: METRONOME LAUNCH WEEK
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Trusted by OpenAI, NVIDIA, and Anthropic, Metronome is the
infrastructure for modern monetization. As part of a week's worth of
launches, they're announcing a host of new capabilities - including
three new ways to support flexible and hybrid pricing models [4]:

💺 SEAT-BASED CREDITS combine per-seat billing with usage-based
consumption, letting companies assign credit allowances per user that
can be pooled across an organization or restricted to individuals.

📦 PACKAGES let teams manage standard pricing tiers in a
good–better–best model. Define these tiers in Metronome, then
provision customers instantly without engineering involvement.

🪜 ACCOUNT HIERARCHY enables parent–child contract structures
where usage, commitments, and reporting can roll up to a single
organization.

 GOOGLE TO RELEASE NANO BANANA PRO POWERED BY GEMINI 3 PRO NEXT WEEK
(1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google plans to launch Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro next week. The
company has consistently updated its Gemini models across its suite
simultaneously, and the same broad rollout is expected again this
time. The Pro branding suggests that Google plans to provide
accessible and production-grade generative tools across its platform
ecosystem. 

 WE'RE ROLLING OUT GPT-5.1 AND NEW CUSTOMIZATION FEATURES. ASK US
ANYTHING (REDDIT THREAD) [6] 

 GPT-5.1 is now rolling out to users. It features 8 unique chat
styles, making it easier for users to set the tone and style that
feels right for them. This Reddit Ask Me Anything features members
from OpenAI's team. 

 OPENAI-BACKED FUTUREHOUSE LAUNCHES KOSMOS AI SCIENTIST (9 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 FutureHouse (which is transitioning to commercial spinout Edison
Scientific) released an AI scientist that reads 1,500 papers and runs
42,000 lines of analysis code per run. Beta users estimate that a
single Kosmos run accomplishes what would take them six months, with
79.4% of conclusions accurate, though the system sometimes pursues
statistically significant but scientifically irrelevant findings. It's
already made seven discoveries—three reproduced unpublished findings
and four contributed novel insights, including one related to
Alzheimer's that was validated in human tissue. Kosmos is launching at
$200 per run with a generous free tier for academics.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE 1 BILLION TOKEN CHALLENGE: FINDING THE PERFECT PRE-TRAINING MIX
(13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most modern language models require massive computational resources
and months of training time. This post discusses how to achieve the
optimal recipe for creating efficient pre-training data sets to
achieve high performance while using dramatically less data. It
uncovers critical insights about dataset mixing strategy, failure
modes in curriculum testing, and the 'goldilocks zone' for synthetic
content. The resulting mixture consistently outperforms complex
curriculum strategies and avoids catastrophic failures while
maintaining excellent generalization. 

 THE BITTER LESSONS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A race is a competition with clear boundaries and a clearly defined
finish line. This isn't the case with the AI 'race' between the US and
China. Nobody currently knows where AI is headed. The field is still
being explored. The US and China are taking different strategies that
play to their unique strengths. They are locked in a structural
conflict, and harmony appears impossible.

 BEFORE YOU PICK AN AI PROTOTYPING TOOL, ANSWER ONE QUESTION (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Most teams ask "Which tool is best?" The better question: "Which
approach gets us from idea to collaboration fastest?" Miro's AI
prototyping landscape guide [10] provides a requirement question set,
decision framework, and evaluation scorecard so you can pick the tools
that actually match your needs. Get the guide [10] 

 WE JUST LAUNCHED STRUCTURED OUTPUTS IN THE CLAUDE API (1 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Structured outputs are now available in public beta for Claude Sonnet
4.5 and Opus 4.1. Support for Haiku 4.5 is coming soon. Without
structured outputs, Claude may generate malformed JSON responses or
invalidate tool inputs, breaking applications, even with careful
prompting. Structured outputs constrain Claude's responses so they
follow a specific schema. This ensures valid, parsable output for
downstream processing. 

 CONTEXT MANAGEMENT IN AMP (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The context window is the entire input that a large language model
receives when generating output. It contains messages, the model's
replies, tool calls, and the thinking blocks the model outputs to
'reason'. Everything that happens between the user and the model goes
into the context window. This article walks users through some of the
ways Amp gives users to manage the contents in a context window. 

 DEPTH ANYTHING 3 RELEASED (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Depth Anything 3 (DA3) estimates spatially consistent depth from
single or multi-view images, regardless of camera pose availability.
It relies on a plain transformer backbone and a single depth-ray
representation to simplify architecture and training. 

 DISTILLATION FOR BLACK-BOX LLMS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GAD introduces a new approach for distilling knowledge from black-box
LLMs using only generated text, without access to output
probabilities. It trains a student model through adversarial learning
against a discriminator, enabling on-policy imitation.

 AI IS A NEW COMPUTING PARADIGM (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI allows us to write programs by specifying objectives. If a task is
verifiable, then a neural net can be trained to do it extremely well.
The more a task is verifiable, the more it is amenable to automation
using AI. 

 SATYA NADELLA'S REFLECTION ON AI PLATFORMS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft co-designed its new AI superfactory with OpenAI and Nvidia,
integrating three generations of frontier training systems and adding
AMD for GPT inference to broaden the hardware stack. The company aims
to scale this infrastructure so enterprises can train and run their
own models without ceding value or control to major AI vendors. The
biggest impact will come when industries like pharma, manufacturing,
and education use AI to compress timelines and expand output, creating
positive-sum economic gains.
