 WHY YOUR GENAI INTERFACE MIGHT NEED MORE FRICTION, NOT LESS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 The standard UX playbook says, "reduce friction at all costs," but
with genAI systems, this conventional wisdom might not always hold
true. Strategic friction can actually prevent hallucinations and build
user trust.

Algolia's new developer guide [4] explores this counterintuitive
principle along with practical implementation patterns for responsible
genAI systems. The guide includes code snippets and system diagrams
for implementing explainable AI techniques [4], multi-output
generation, and content moderation pipelines.

Learn how to design systems that balance automation with appropriate
human oversight and implement feedback loops that improve over time.

MISCELLANEOUS

 RESILIENT AI INFRASTRUCTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Harvey uses a centralized Python library for managing AI model
interactions to ensure reliable deployments through active load
balancing and real-time monitoring. It implements a distributed rate
limiting system to handle bursty traffic and maintain performance
while allowing seamless model upgrades. The setup enhances security,
optimizes resource utilization, and supports rapid deployment,
performance tracking, and failure detection to provide a consistent
user experience.

While promising, the technology raises concerns over potential misuse,
particularly in creating deepfakes. Character.AI's platform already
faces safety issues, with lawsuits alleging its chatbots have
encouraged harmful behaviors. 

 HIGH SCHOOLERS' AI-ENABLED DEVICE DETERS DRUNK DRIVING (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 High school students from North Carolina, aiming to prevent drunk

alcohol impairment in drivers using cameras, sensors, and machine
learning. The team has secured a U.S. patent, partnered with
organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and received
interest from major automakers at CES. They are advocating for
legislation mandating DUI detection systems in vehicles while
targeting fleet operators and parents as early adopters.
