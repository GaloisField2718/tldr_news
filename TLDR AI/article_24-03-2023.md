HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

CHATGPT PLUGINS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins?utm_source=tldrai] 

Plugins are tools designed specifically for language models with
safety as a core principle, and help ChatGPT access up-to-date
information, run computations, or use third-party services. The first
plugins have been created by Expedia, FiscalNote, Instacart, KAYAK,
Klarna, Milo, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Speak, Wolfram, and Zapier.
Plugins could also increase safety challenges by taking harmful or
unintended actions, so OpenAI is implementing several safeguards. For
example, developers can add information to their robots.txt file to
prevent ChatGPT from accessing their website. 

BILL GATES ON THE AGE OF AI (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun?utm_source=tldrai]


Bill Gates has hailed the development of AI as the most important
advance in technology since the introduction of the graphical user
interface. Gates is particularly interested in the potential of AI to
help reduce global inequity, including the prevention of child deaths
caused by preventable diseases, improving education, and mitigating
the effects of climate change. However, he acknowledged that AI also
raises ethical and social issues, such as workforce displacement,
privacy, and bias, and called for governments and philanthropy to
ensure the technology reduces inequality. 

ADOBE FIREFLY (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Firefly, is a family of creative generative AI models coming to Adobe
products for creatives, editors, artists, and more. Use their tools
for digital imaging, photography, illustration, graphic design, video,
marketing, social media, and 3D modeling. You‚Äôll be able to do
things like highlight a part of a picture and create variations, add
custom styles and textures, and edit videos using text descriptions.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

EARLY EXPERIMENTS WITH GPT-4 (30 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712?utm_source=tldrai] 

GPT-4, the latest model developed by OpenAI, exhibits more general
intelligence than previous AI models, as it can solve novel and
difficult tasks spanning various domains, without needing special
prompting, and its performance is strikingly close to human-level.
This paper is a thorough study of GPT4 capabilities and shortcomings. 

REPOCODER: STREAMLINING REPOSITORY-LEVEL CODE COMPLETION (12 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12570?utm_source=tldrai] 

RepoCoder is a simple and effective framework for repository-level
code completion that utilizes a similarity-based retriever and a
pre-trained code language model, and an iterative retrieval-generation
paradigm. It significantly improves the zero-shot code completion
baseline and outperforms the vanilla retrieval-augmented code
completion approach. The proposed benchmark, RepoEval, provides
valuable insights for future research.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

PIX2VIDEO: VIDEO EDITING USING IMAGE DIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://duyguceylan.github.io/pix2video.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai]


The paper proposes a training-free and generalizable approach for
text-guided video editing using pre-trained structure-guided image
diffusion models. The two-step method involves performing text-guided
edits on an anchor frame using the diffusion model and then
progressively propagating the changes to future frames via
self-attention feature injection, resulting in realistic edits without
any compute-intensive preprocessing or video-specific finetuning. 

GENERATIVE MODELS FOR MEDICAL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels?utm_source=tldrai] 

A good step towards evaluation, creation, and curation of generative
models for a wide variety of tasks with a specific focus on medical.
This project aims to assist by building tools for generative medical
tasks and comes with metrics and tutorials to help you get started. 

MODELSCOPE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope?utm_source=tldrai] 

ModelScope is a web-based platform that provides interactive
visualization and analysis of machine learning models' performance and
interpretability, enabling users to explore and compare various
models' results.

MISCELLANEOUS

OPENAI RESEARCHER ACCESS PROGRAM (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers can get subsidized access to models and continued access
to codex. The form asks a set of questions about you and your research
direction. It‚Äôs not clear what sorts of programs they‚Äôre looking
to support, but application seems necessary for some research
directions to continue. 

COMPUTE FRAGMENTATION IS HOLDING US BACK (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.modular.com/blog/ais-compute-fragmentation-what-matrix-multiplication-teaches-us?utm_source=tldrai]


Algorithms, data, and compute are the holy trinity of AI progress.
Compute is currently a strong bottleneck for a number of reasons. One
of which is the disparate nature of hardware accelerators used in ML
model training. Writing efficient code for all of these pieces of
hardware is challenging, but potentially necessary, work for the
future of AI.
