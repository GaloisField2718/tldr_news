HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI HAS OPEN-SOURCED GROK 2.5 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 xAI has open-sourced the model weights for Grok 2.5, its leading
model from last year, on Hugging Face. Elon Musk noted that Grok 3 is
expected to be open-sourced in about six months. 

 META PARTNERS WITH MIDJOURNEY FOR AI RESEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta has announced a partnership with Midjourney to license its AI
image and video generation technology. The collaboration aims to
integrate Midjourney's tools into Meta's research and future products
as part of a broader strategy combining talent, compute, and industry
partnerships. 

 APPLE IN TALKS TO USE GOOGLE'S GEMINI AI TO POWER REVAMPED SIRI (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A deal would mark a dramatic departure from Apple's traditionally
secretive, in-house development ethos, a sign that investor pressure
is mounting after engineering setbacks have delayed Siri's AI overhaul
for over a year.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BUILD VS BUY IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There are two ways to solve a problem: build a solution, or buy a
solution. Thanks to generative AI, it's now much easier to build.
However, that doesn't mean that everyone will build and no one will
buy. Business software often contains thousands of complex business
rules with millions of lines of business logic that capture
constraints and processes around policy, compliance, security, legal,
finance, pricing, and more. Many of these rules take considerable time
and effort to discern and codify. The vast majority of people,
technical or not, who wish to create apps have little to no idea about
these business rules. 

 BUILDING PRODUCTION-READY CUDA KERNELS (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Kernel-builder is a library for building and deploying custom CUDA
kernels across architectures. This guide walks through how to create a
kernel and production-ready deployment. 

 AGI IS AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AGI won't emerge purely from making LLMs bigger, but from building
agentic systems that orchestrate dozens or thousands of specialized
sub-agents. Current LLMs are already as good as the best humans at
many tasks across many domains, but lack the architectural
infrastructure (context management, memory systems, integrations, and
error-tolerant orchestration) needed to effectively elicit those
capabilities.

 CRITICAL AI SECURITY GUIDELINES BY SANS INSTITUTE (SPONSOR) [12] 

 This first-of-its-kind framework provides expert guidance on how to
keep building and innovating, while protecting against threats such as
model poisoning, prompt injection, and adversarial attack. Download
SANS' Critical AI Security Guidelines [13]. Then, explore hands-on AI
training from SANS [14] to build the practical skills your team needs
to defend today's intelligent systems. 

 MEET AGEX (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Agex is a Python-native agentic framework that enables agents to work
directly with existing libraries and runtimes. It allows agents to
receive and return complex Python objects like DataFrames, Plotly
figures, or even callables. Agex runs only whitelisted operations
within a sandbox. Agents' REPLs are persisted across tasks, so agents
can build their own helpers and improve over time. 

 HOW TO FIX YOUR CONTEXT (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Context management is usually the hardest part about building an
agent. The job of the agent designer is to make sure agents have the
right context window. Context is not free - every token in the context
influences model behavior. The massive context windows of modern large
language models are a powerful capability, but they can easily result
in sloppy information management. Make sure everything in the context
is something that matters. 

 SHORTER TOKENS ARE MORE LIKELY (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Large language models may be pushed to select 'slop' words because
those words have more possible endings, even if none of those endings
are the best one. Small and seemingly unimportant changes to
tokenizers can have an unexpectedly large effect on outputs.
Character-level transformers may be worse, but models that try to
group tokens so that they're equally 'surprising' might make it
better. 

 PARALLEL THINKING WITH CONFIDENCE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Meta AI introduced a parallel thinking method that uses
model-internal confidence to filter low-quality reasoning traces
during or after generation, requiring no extra training or tuning and
integrating into existing serving frameworks.

 OPENAI WARNS AGAINST SPVS AND OTHER ‘UNAUTHORIZED' INVESTMENTS (1
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI has warned investors against unauthorized opportunities to
gain exposure to OpenAI, including special purpose vehicles (SPVs).
While not every offer of OpenAI equity is problematic, some firms are
attempting to circumvent the startup's transfer restrictions. These
sales will not be recognized and will carry no economic value to
buyers. Anthropic has also told investors to avoid using SPVs to
invest in an upcoming round. 

 NVIDIA LOOKING TO HALT H20 CHIP PRODUCTION AFTER CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON
PURCHASES (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Nvidia has asked its suppliers to pause production of its
China-specific H20 chips after the Chinese government told domestic
tech companies to stop purchasing Nvidia's chips and turn to local
alternatives.
