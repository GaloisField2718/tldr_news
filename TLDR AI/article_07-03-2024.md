HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL X SNOWFLAKE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral and Snowflake have partnered to bring Mistral Large to
Snowflake Cortex customers. 

 MOONDREAM 2 SMALL VISION LANGUAGE MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Moondream is a small Phi-2 and SigLIP-based language model. This
second version is commercially licensed and has significantly improved
benchmark performance. It is ideal for running on low compute devices
and describing images. 

 DRIVERLESS STARTUP WAYMO TO TEST SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES WITH NO HUMAN
DRIVER IN AUSTIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Waymo is starting tests of its fifth-generation driverless Jaguar
I-Pace in Austin as it advances towards launching a ride-hail service.
Initially, rides will be for Waymo employees, with plans to open to
the public later. Waymo's expansion in Austin contributes to its
roadmap of providing autonomous vehicle services in multiple cities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DESIGN2CODE: HOW FAR ARE WE FROM AUTOMATING FRONT-END ENGINEERING?
(25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Taking images of a design and outputting code is a challenging task.
This work proposes a benchmark, 18B model, and evaluations to suggest
that we are close to being able to perform this on simple designs. In
some cases, GPT-4V-generated code is preferred over human-synthesized
code. 

 MATHSCALE: SCALING INSTRUCTION TUNING FOR MATHEMATICAL REASONING (26
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers used synthetic data to generate 2 million path problems.
They then trained a 7B model and found strong performance against
state-of-the-art large language models. 

 MAKING AI TO PLAN AND EXECUTE COMPLEX TASKS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The KEPP system introduces a new approach to planning and executing
complex tasks. The method, which leverages a probabilistic knowledge
graph, allows the model to logically sequence actions towards
achieving a goal.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MLX SWIFT EXAMPLES (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MLX is a framework developed by Apple for training AI models on Mac.
This repository shows how to train models that can run on mobile
devices with Swift. It takes one on an iPhone to train an MNIST
classifier model. 

 HUGGINGFACE TEXT CLUSTERING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An open source text clustering tool that allows you to embed,
cluster, and semantically label clusters easily and quickly. The
entire pipeline runs in 10 minutes on 100k samples. 

 ENHANCING LLMS‚Äô PLANNING SKILLS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 KnowAgent introduces a novel strategy for boosting large language
models' planning skills by integrating explicit action knowledge. The
approach helps LLMs perform better in complex tasks by guiding them
through more logical planning trajectories.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WE NEED SELF-DRIVING CARS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A Waymo self-driving car was vandalized and set on fire in San
Francisco, an act seen by some as a protest against the imposition of
autonomous vehicles. Such hostility overlooks the potential for
self-driving cars to drastically reduce traffic fatalities. As the
technology improves, autonomous vehicles will enhance safety and
complement public transport. 

 OPENAI SORA: ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE MATRIX (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's Sora is a text-to-video model capable of generating
high-fidelity videos with diverse aspect ratios and resolutions that
also exhibits world simulation abilities. Sora‚Äôs vast capabilities
raises both excitement and concerns about the implications for reality
simulation and AGI. 

 SUBPRIME INTELLIGENCE (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's Sora exhibits significant flaws, revealing the limitations
of generative AI's understanding. The technology's potential impact on
the creative industry and its heavy computational demands highlight
both its revolutionary capabilities and practical challenges.
