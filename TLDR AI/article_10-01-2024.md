HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 RABBIT FOUNDATION MODEL AND COMPUTER (25 MINUTE VIDEO) [5] 

 Rabbit created a large action model (LAM) that goes with its R1
pocket companion computer. The company's R1 device is a reimagination
of the computer and smartphone, powered almost entirely by its LAM. 

 OPENAI‚ÄôS NEWS PUBLISHERS DEALS REPORTEDLY TOP OUT AT $5M A YEAR (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is offering news publishers between $1M and $5M a year to use
their content to train its AI models. 

 INTEL IS BRINGING THE AI PC TO THE CAR (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Intel has announced an AI-focused chip for the automotive sector.
Described as "the first-generation AI-enhanced software-defined
vehicle system-on-chip," the announcement marks a strategic shift
towards AI PCs and automotive AI applications.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 A MINIMALIST APPROACH TO ALIGNMENT (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google researchers have introduced Self-Play Preference Optimization
(SPO), a simpler form of alignment than traditional RLHF. The
researchers turned to game theory and figured out single-player self
play dynamics that are robust to noisy preferences and give strong
performance. 

 MIXTRAL OF EXPERTS PAPER (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Mixtral paper has been released. There is no discussion of
pretraining datasets. Most of the things disclosed are well known, but
there is an interesting new insight on the discussion of routing
evaluation between experts. 

 EVALUATION METRIC FOR TEXT-TO-3D MODELS (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new evaluation metric for text-to-3D
generative models, addressing the limitations of current
single-criterion metrics. This advanced method uses GPT-4V to create
prompts and compare 3D assets. It aligns closely with human
preferences and offers versatility by adapting to various user-defined
criteria.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AI TOOLKIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 AI Toolkit is a header-only C++ library that provides tools for
building the brain of your game's NPCs. 

 HUMAN COMMUNICATION SIMULATION WITH MULTI-MODAL LLMS (2 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 SpeechAgents is a multi-modal AI system capable of simulating human
communication with remarkable authenticity. This system, powered by a
multi-modal LLM, can handle up to 25 agents. It shows potential in
creating dramas and audio novels through its ability to mimic human
dialogues, complete with consistent content, realistic rhythms, and
expressive emotions. 

 VISION TRANSFORMERS WITH SELF-EMERGING TOKEN LABELING FOR ROBUSTNESS
(GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 In a significant advancement for Vision Transformers (ViTs),
researchers have improved the robustness of the Fully Attentional
Network (FAN) models using a new self-emerging token labeling (STL)
framework. This approach involves training a FAN token labeler to
create meaningful patch token labels, followed by training a FAN
student model.

 DOES AI RISK ‚ÄúOTHER‚Äù THE AIS? (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This essay explores Robin Hanson's critique of AI risk discourse,
focusing on the concept of "othering" AIs and the ethical implications
of controlling or altering future AI and human values. Hanson argues
that fearing AI as an "other" is a form of bias. Hanson's views may
not sufficiently consider the risks of uncontrolled AI development and
the challenges in aligning future AI values with human ethics. 

 ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF CHATGPT. HAS AI BECOME THE NEW TECH PLATFORM?
(6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article introduces the "Anatomy Framework", a tool for assessing
the disruptive potential of any innovation, including AI. It explores
innovation from five layers: underlying infrastructure, core platform,
applications, tools, and ecosystem enablers. It also discusses the
role of startup and incumbent innovators and the medium of innovation
(hardware vs. software). 

 ENHANCING MEDICAL EXPERTISE IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Researchers have developed a new Multi-disciplinary Collaboration
framework to improve Large Language Models' understanding and
reasoning in the medical field. This approach involves AI agents
role-playing working together to analyze, discuss, and reach consensus
on medical topics.

 HUMAN POSE AND BODY SHAPE EDITING (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This project introduces a one-shot method for editing human images
that can make significant changes in pose and body shape while
preserving the person's identity.

 A personalized AI sales coach for each and every cold call. 

 GOOGLE OPEN SOURCES 1.6T MOE MODEL (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [19] 

 The switch transformer from Google was one of the first successful
Mixture-of-Experts models. It now is available with code on the
HuggingFace platform.
