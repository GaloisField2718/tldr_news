HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC PROMPT LIBRARY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The release of Claude 3 has been quite popular, but the prompting
style for these models is slightly different. Anthropic has collected
a set of user prompts that work well for a wide variety of tasks and
topics. 

 APPLE RESEARCHERS ACHIEVE BREAKTHROUGH IN MULTIMODAL AI (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Apple researchers have developed methods for training large language
models on both text and images, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in multimodal AI tasks. 

 STABILITY AI RELEASES STABLE VIDEO 3D (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Built on top of Stable Video, Stable Video 3D can generate 3D models
from a single image. It outperforms Stable Zero 123 and other methods.
Weights are available for research purposes and commercial use with a
Stability AI membership.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MECHANICS OF NEXT TOKEN PREDICTION WITH SELF-ATTENTION (40 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Next token prediction is a simple objective that leads to complex
behaviors. This work found that a single self attention layer trained
with gradient descent broke the problem down into hard retrieval and
soft composition, which enabled in-context learning and strong overall
performance. 

 ENHANCING OBJECT DETECTION WITH VISUAL TRANSFORMERS (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 YOLOX-ViT introduces a new approach to object detection in underwater
robotics by integrating visual transformers and knowledge
distillation. 

 PRETRAINING THE SAME MODEL WITH 16 DIFFERENT TOKENIZERS (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A weird fact of modern language modeling is that we train a tokenizer
first before training the model. The second weird fact is that vocab
size doesn't seem to matter too much at large scales.

Van Segbroeck, Ph.D., Principal Applied Science @ Gretel
TIME: Monday, April 1st, at 1pm PT / 4pm ET [10]

WHAT: This workshop will showcase an end-to-end machine learning
approach [10] to automatically anonymize sensitive customer data in
financial documents, including:

 	* Generating synthetic training data
 	* Fine-tuning language models
 	* Deploying through a Streamlit application
 	* Enabling human-in-the-loop validation

 LLM4DECOMPILE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Decompile binary code with large language models. 

 3D SCENE UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 GroupContrast redefines self-supervised 3D representation learning by
integrating segment grouping with semantic-aware contrastive learning.


 OBJECT RECOGNITION ACROSS DIFFERENT SPECTRUMS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project introduces a new method for identifying objects in
images taken from various spectrums like RGB, near-infrared, and
thermal imaging, focusing on object-centric information to overcome
background noise and improve recognition accuracy.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAPTAIN'S LOG: THE IRREDUCIBLE WEIRDNESS OF PROMPTING AIS (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A new companion website, More Useful Things, offers a trove of free
AI and machine learning resources, underlining the quirky and
effective ways AI-generated prompts, like imaginative scenarios, can
outperform human-crafted ones in tasks such as mathematical
problem-solving. The experiment underscores the importance of adding
context, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought techniques for more
consistent prompting results. As AI models advance, prompting as a
skill may become less critical, with AI improving at inferring user
intent, but currently, structured prompting remains an evolving art
with significant potential benefits. 

 AI PROMPT ENGINEERING IS DEAD (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Recent studies suggest human prompt engineers may become obsolete as
AI and machine learning models increasingly optimize their own
prompts. Algorithmically generated prompts can be bizarre yet
effective, outperforming human-crafted ones and reducing optimization
time dramatically. While automatically tuned prompts show promise,
experts believe that the demand for prompt-related jobs will evolve
rather than disappear, potentially under new job titles like LLMOps
(Large Language Model Operations).
