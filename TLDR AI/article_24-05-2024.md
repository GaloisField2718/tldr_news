 OPTIMIZE YOUR SODIUM INTAKE TO OPTIMIZE YOUR HEALTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Studies suggest you need 3x more sodium for optimal mental and
physical performance. Keeping a good balance of water and minerals [4]
is the name of the game ‚Äî and that's where LMNT come in.

‚ö° These multi-flavoured electrolyte drinks [4] are scientifically
proven to optimize productivity and health with vital electrolytes [4]
(sodium, potassium, and magnesium) ‚Äî and none of the harmful
additives you get in store-bought sports drinks.

You're guaranteed to find an LMNT flavor you love [4]. Try
fan-favorites Citrus Salt or Raspberry Salt, get spicy with Mango
Chili, or mix Chocolate Salt into your morning coffee for a mean
mocha.

legal model together. 

 H RAISES $220M SEED ROUND (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 H, which aims to build action models and was started by DeepMind
scientists, raised a monster seed round. Another win for French AI
talent. 

 REFLECTIONS ON OUR RESPONSIBLE SCALING POLICY (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy aims to prevent catastrophic
AI safety failures by identifying high-risk capabilities, testing
models regularly, and implementing strict safety standards, with a
focus on continuous improvement and collaboration with industry and
government.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 COHERE'S AYA MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Aya project has 3 different models of increasing size and can
converse in 101 languages, many of which are extremely low resource.
This project is an incredible step for the open and general access
research community. 

 TEXT-VIDEO RETRIEVAL (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new method, Global-Local Semantic
Consistent Learning (GLSCL), to enhance text-video retrieval while
significantly reducing computational costs. 

 TEXT-BASED UNDERSTANDING OF PROTEINS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers present ProtT3, a new framework designed to enhance
text-based understanding of proteins by combining Protein Language
Models (PLMs) with traditional Language Models (LMs). ProtT3
integrates a PLM for processing amino acid sequences and a language
model for generating high-quality textual descriptions using a
cross-modal projector called Q-Former.

free. [12] 

 DISTRIBUTED INFERENCE ON LLAMA CPP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Llama cpp now supports distributed inference across multiple
machines. It is limited to FP16 for now, but is a great step for open
source deployment. 

 ENHANCING LONG-TERM MEMORY FOR LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM (SirLLM) is a new approach that
helps large language models maintain longer memory during extended
dialogues. 

 REMOTE SENSING IMAGE CAPTIONING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project introduces a new probabilistic diffusion model for
Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning (RSICC), which describes
environmental changes over time.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PALIGEMMA: OPEN SOURCE MULTIMODAL MODEL BY GOOGLE (9 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Google has introduced PaliGemma, an open-source vision language model
with multimodal capabilities that outperforms its contemporaries in
object detection and segmentation. Optimized for fine-tuning on
specific tasks, PaliGemma opens possibilities for custom AI
applications and provides comprehensive resources for immediate use.
PaliGemma demonstrates superior results in OCR and shows promise for
various use cases when fine-tuned with custom data. 

 AI IS THE REASON INTERVIEWS ARE HARDER NOW (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article discusses the rising complexity of technical interview
questions, with companies now requiring candidates to solve harder
problems in shorter times. It highlights the use of AI tools like
Ultracode that can assist even non-technical users in passing such
interviews. The piece suggests in-person interviews as a solution to
ensure that candidates actually possess the programming skills needed
for the job. 

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED BUILDING INTERACTIVE EMBEDDING VISUALIZATIONS (21
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 An individual passionate about interactive embedding visualizations
shares their refined workflow for creating such visualizations, which
convey the intricate relationships between entities represented as
points in high-dimensional spaces. The process involves data
collection, building a co-occurrence matrix, sparsifying the matrix,
embedding with PyMDE, and projecting to 2D for clear visualization.
The creator utilizes web apps for the UI, advocating for their
accessibility and GPU-accelerated rendering capabilities.
