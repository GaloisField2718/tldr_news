 THE OPENAI KEYNOTE (14 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman showcased new features and improvements to the
company‚Äôs AI models at its first developer conference, emphasizing a
future where AI integration will play a central role in consumer
technology. The event highlighted OpenAI's shift towards a
product-centric approach, with new tools being made immediately
available, and hinted at potential forays into hardware to reduce
friction in AI accessibility. 

 NVIDIA IS PILOTING A GENERATIVE AI FOR ITS ENGINEERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nvidia revealed the testing of a large language model named ChipNeMo
to enhance chip designers' productivity during a keynote at the
IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design. Although
not yet fully proven, ChipNeMo aids in scripting for design tools,
summarizing bug reports, and serving as an experienced chatbot for
designers. 

 YOUTUBE TO TEST GENERATIVE AI FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 YouTube is testing new generative AI features as part of its premium
subscription service. These features include a conversational tool for
asking questions about content and getting recommendations and another
for summarizing comment topics.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TRANSFORMER BASED DIFFUSION MODEL IS 90% CHEAPER TO TRAIN THAN UNET
BASED MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PixArt is a new text to image model that uses T5 text encodings,
cross attention, and a diffusion transformer to great results at a
fraction of the compute cost of comparable models. 

 ENHANCING LANGUAGE MODELS WITHOUT RETRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 The DARE method streamlines the enhancement of language models like
BERT, allowing the integration of new functions into a unified model,
increasing efficiency on various linguistic tasks. 

 EFFICIENT LEARNING FOR SENTENCE EMBEDDING (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cross-View Training (SCT) elevates small language models, enabling
them to produce sentence embeddings previously only achievable by
larger models, optimizing both performance and computational
efficiency.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 COGVLM-17B OPEN VISION LANGUAGE MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 With 10B vision parameters and 7B language parameters, this
multimodal model excels at many standard benchmarks and performs well
on human evaluation. 

 LANGROID MULTI-AGENT PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Inspired by the Actor framework, this lightweight Python library
makes it easy to create LLM-powered agents. 

 INSTANT 3D SEARCH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 OVIR-3D innovates 3D object retrieval from text prompts using 2D
image fusion, bypassing the need for 3D data training and facilitating
instant, real-time search capabilities ideal for robotics.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ALMOST AN AGENT: WHAT GPTS CAN DO (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's latest GPTs edge closer to the vision of autonomous AI
agents. They are capable of executing tasks like crafting academic
papers with minimal human input, despite current constraints like
occasional inaccuracies. This leap forward in AI autonomy promises
significant advancements but also underscores the urgency for vigilant
development to mitigate potential vulnerabilities as AI begins to
navigate more complex and independent roles. 

 ARE LANGUAGE MODELS GOOD AT MAKING PREDICTIONS? (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In a study using 5000 questions from Manifold Markets, GPT-4 was
found to be consistently overconfident in its predictions. 

 OPENAI IS A LOT MORE VULNERABLE THAN YOU THINK (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 On the heels of OpenAI releasing functionality that decimated half
GPT-wrapper companies, here is a contrarian view of the blind spots
and weaknesses of OpenAI as this market continues to evolve.
