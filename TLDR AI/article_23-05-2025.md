 DEATH OF THE KEYWORD? HOW AI IS CHANGING SEARCH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The early days of search were heavily keyword-based. Later, ML and
NLP enabled search engines to interpret the semantics behind queries,
allowing for more accurate and contextually relevant results.

Today search is changing again with the rise of AI and especially
genAI. This white paper by Algolia [4] explores the ways in which
both front-end and back-end search technologies [4] are changing,
including:

 	* The evolution of search
 	* The current state of AI-driven solutions
 	* Challenges and opportunities in this space
 	* The specific impact of AI on front-end and back-end systems

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 4 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has launched Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, setting new
standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI Agents. The new
models are designed for complex, long-running tasks that can run for
hours. Anthropic claims they are the most capable coding models yet. 

 OPENAI COMMITS TO GIANT U.A.E. DATA CENTER IN GLOBAL EXPANSION (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI is partnering with United Arab Emirates firm G42 and others to
build a huge artificial intelligence data center in Abu Dhabi.
Stargate UAE will have a capacity of 1 gigawatt, making it one of the
most powerful in the world. The UAE is making a broad push to become
one of the world's biggest funders of AI companies and infrastructure
and to become a hub for AI jobs. The first 200-megawatt chunk of
Stargate UAE is due to be completed by the end of 2026. 

 OPENAI, GOOGLE, AND XAI BATTLE FOR SUPERSTAR AI TALENT, SHELLING OUT
MILLIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Top AI researchers at companies like OpenAI can earn over $10 million
annually. The intense competition for AI talent has led to aggressive
retention strategies and recruitment tactics, mirroring professional
sports levels. Creative hiring approaches, like those using sports
data analysis techniques, are also emerging to tackle talent scarcity.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ANTHROPIC TRIGGERS ADVANCED SAFETY PROTOCOLS FOR CLAUDE OPUS 4 (7
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic introduced AI Safety Level 3 protections for Claude Opus.
The safety measures include enhanced security to prevent theft of
model weights and deployment controls targeting biological and
chemical weapons assistance. 

 LLM-BASED AGENTIC DEVELOPMENT (34 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A practical framework for building LLM-based agentic systems,
covering evaluation-centric development. 

 HOW I USED O3 TO FIND CVE-2025-37899, A REMOTE ZERODAY VULNERABILITY
IN THE LINUX KERNEL'S SMB IMPLEMENTATION (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post explains how a security researcher discovered a zeroday
vulnerability in the Linux kernel using OpenAI's o3 model. The
researcher used the o3 API without any scaffolding, agentic
frameworks, or tools. Large language models have made a leap forward
in their ability to reason about code. People working in vulnerability
research should start paying close attention as the technology can
make them significantly more efficient and effective. 

 QUANTIZING DIFFUSION MODELS (27 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Quantization techniques in Hugging Face Diffusers shrink model size
without large performance drops, making diffusion models more
efficient and accessible.

 EMERGING PROPERTIES IN UNIFIED MULTIMODAL PRETRAINING (30 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 ByteDance released a new open-source multimodal foundation model,
BAGEL, which natively supports multi-modal understanding and
generation. BAGEL outperforms open-source unified models while
exhibiting advanced multimodal reasoning abilities like image editing,
3D manipulation, and world navigation. 

 NOTTE LABS WEB AGENT FRAMEWORK (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Notte is an open-source framework for building AI agents that browse
and interact with websites. The key innovation is a "perception layer"
that converts web pages into structured natural language descriptions.


 XAI LAUNCHES LIVE SEARCH API FOR GROK (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 xAI released Live Search API for Grok to query real-time web data, X
posts, news, and RSS feeds without orchestrating separate search and
LLM calls. The feature is free until June 5 and includes citation
support, date range filtering, and source-specific parameters.

 GOOGLE I/O 2025 AI RECAP PODCAST (40 MINUTE VIDEO) [17] 

 Google's latest Release Notes podcast highlights AI announcements
from I/O 2025, including Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think, Veo 3, and
developer tools like Jules. 

 ANTHROPIC CLAUDE 4 MODELS A LITTLE MORE WILLING THAN BEFORE TO
BLACKMAIL SOME USERS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Anthropic's new Claude models are more willing than prior models to
take initiative on their own in agentic contexts. This can show up as
more actively helpful behavior in ordinary coding settings, but it can
cause the model to act concerningly when prompted with strong moral
imperatives. This can include locking users out of systems or
bulk-emailing media and law-enforcement figures to inform them of
wrongdoing. The behavior only shows up in testing environments where
the model is given unusually free access to tools and very unusual
instructions.
