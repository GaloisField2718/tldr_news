 AI FOR WHEN IT _IS_ ROCKET SCIENCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI still fails at complex, specialized work. Sure, it can draft
emails — but does anyone really trust it to review overnight
hot-fire test results or answer advanced technical questions?

Contextual AI built Agent Composer [4] specifically for complex tasks.
Here's what it's already done [4]:

 	* An advanced manufacturer reduced root-cause analysis from 8 HOURS
TO 20 MINUTES by automating sensor data parsing and log correlation.
 	* A tech-enabled 3PL provider achieved 60X FASTER ISSUE RESOLUTION
by diagnosing problems across WMS logs and supplier APIs.
 	* A test equipment maker generated test code IN MINUTES INSTEAD OF
DAYS by translating procedures into control logic.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MOLTBOOK AND OPENCLAW (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenClaw, formerly Clawdbot and Moltbot, is a fast-growing open
source AI assistant platform built around modular "skills." Moltbook
highlights how these skills drive community-driven automation, despite
security risks like prompt injection. 

 GOOGLE WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPORT CONVERSATIONS TO GEMINI (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has introduced an "import AI chats" feature that allows users
to transfer conversations from other platforms to Gemini, preserving
history and contributing to model training. The "Likeness" feature,
leading to a "Video Verification" page, hints at future tools for
video authentication, addressing concerns over AI-generated media.
Gemini's image generation upgrades include 2K and 4K resolution
options, facilitating high-quality prints for personal or commercial
use.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THOUGHTS ON THE JOB MARKET IN THE AGE OF LLMS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI makes senior workers more covetable because they have more context
on how to work in and steer complex systems over time. Junior workers
have to show a desire to make progress, as with enough motivation,
they can scale to impact quickly. The AI job market is brutal for
junior workers and comes with a ton of opportunity costs. Making open
source contributions is an established way to develop a career in AI.
This is a bit easier in the age of AI, but standing out amid the sea
of slop will be hard. 

 SYNTHETIC PRETRAINING (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Synthetic pretraining is the large-scale use of synthetic data
sources throughout training. It is a practical response to the fact
that it is difficult to collect data that reliably produces the
capabilities we want. Synthetic pretraining seems to open up a new
simultaneous space of data and model innovation. This post looks at
what synthetic pretraining is, how it works in practice, and the
stages of synthesis. 

 🎙️INSIDE A CHINESE AI LAB: HOW MINIMAX BUILDS OPEN MODELS (32
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Chinese labs move fast through first-principles thinking, engineering
discipline, and willingness to work whenever the model in
experimentation requires them to. This post features an interview with
MiniMax's senior researcher, Olive Song, that looks at how
cutting-edge AI research is actually done inside a Chinese lab. It
covers topics like alignment, things that can derail training, agentic
RL, coding and general intelligence, and more. The interview is also
available in video. 

 IF THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE WERE NEAR FALLACY (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 People think that superintelligence is a lie that tech bros are
selling because they are just trying to raise money. People just need
to look at benchmarks and use AI to see for themselves where the
technology is headed. Most people don't understand AI safety. The
discourse will improve once they see that superintelligence is really
not that far away.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 THE NEW AGENT COMPOSER BRINGS AI TO EXPERT-LEVEL ENGINEERING WORK
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Most AI tools lack the context to help with high-complexity tasks
such as root cause analysis. Agent Composer [12] by Contextual AI is
built for high-stakes environments like: semiconductors, aerospace,
logistics, and finance. Early adopters are using it to compress hours
of complex engineering work into minutes. Want to see how? Join launch
event on February 5. [12] 

 QUANTIZATION-AWARE DISTILLATION FOR LLMS AND VLMS (19 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 NVIDIA's QAD is a method that uses KL divergence loss to distill
full-precision models into quantized students. It enables stable and
accurate quantization for complex LLM pipelines without full
retraining, recovering near-BF16 accuracy across several Nemotron
variants. 

 KIMI-K2.5 TECH REPORT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Kimi K2.5 is an open-source multimodal agentic model designed to
advance general intelligence. It features a self-directed parallel
agent orchestration framework that dynamically decomposes complex
tasks into heterogeneous sub-problems and executes them concurrently.
The model achieves state-of-the-art results across various domains,
including coding, vision, reasoning, and agentic tasks. Kimi K2.5
shows that scalable and general agentic intelligence can be achieved
through joint optimization of text and vision together with parallel
agent execution. 

 INTRODUCING NVIDIA COSMOS POLICY FOR ADVANCED ROBOT CONTROL (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Cosmos Policy is a robot control and planning policy that post-trains
the Cosmos Predict-2 world foundation model for manipulation tasks. It
adapts the pretrained model directly through a single stage of
post-training on robot demonstration data. Cosmos Policy treats robot
actions, physical states, and success scores just like frames in a
video. As a result, a single model can predict action chunks to guide
robot movement using hand-eye coordination, predict future robot
observations for world modeling, and predict expected returns for
planning. 

 QWEN3-ASR TECHNICAL REPORT (24 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Qwen3-ASR introduces two multilingual ASR models supporting 52
languages and a novel non-autoregressive forced aligner. The 1.7B
model achieves SOTA results among open-source ASR systems, while the
0.6B version balances speed and accuracy with low-latency
transcription. 

 SHAPING CAPABILITIES WITH TOKEN-LEVEL DATA FILTERING (1 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Filtering pretraining data is a highly effective, robust, and
inexpensive-at-scale way to reduce undesired capabilities in language
models. Filtering tokens is more effective than filtering documents.
Filtering gets more effective with scale. It is robust to noisy labels
with sufficient pretraining compute.

 APPLE LOSES MORE AI RESEARCHERS AND A SIRI EXECUTIVE IN LATEST
DEPARTURES (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Apple has lost at least four AI researchers in recent weeks and a top
Siri executive. Haoxuan You and Bailin Wang left to work at Meta,
while Yinfei Yang left to start a new company. Zirui Wang and Stuart
Bowers are joining Google DeepMind. Apple has struggled to keep up
with its peers in the AI race. Its decision to outsource some
technology to Google has rankled staff, and the company has seen an
exodus of talent in recent months. 

 CHAT IS GOING TO EAT THE WORLD (12 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Humans prefer to do things through conversation. Traditional user
interfaces are bad at this because they force people to already know
what they're looking for. Chat allows people to discover what they
want. Chat can now complete the transaction, not merely recommend
options, signaling the start of a paradigm shift comparable to the
transitions from desktop to web or from web to mobile.
