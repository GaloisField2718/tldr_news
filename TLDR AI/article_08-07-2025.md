 GROK 4 RELEASE LIVESTREAM (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI will hold a livestream for the Grok 4 release on Wednesday at 8
PM PT. 

 APPLE'S TOP AI EXECUTIVE RUOMING PANG LEAVES FOR META (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Ruoming Pang, Apple's head of AI models, is leaving to join Meta's
new superintelligence team. Meta is aggressively recruiting top AI
talent with multi-million-dollar packages and recently reorganized its
AI efforts under Meta Superintelligence Labs, led by Alexandr Wang. 

 CHATGPT EXPERIMENTS WITH ‘STUDY TOGETHER' MODE (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Some users have reported a new experimental ChatGPT feature called
"Study Together" that encourages more interactive learning by
prompting users with questions instead of direct answers. Details
remain sparse, and OpenAI has not made an official announcement.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ECONOMICS OF CLAUDE 3 OPUS INFERENCE (38 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic recently announced the deprecation of API access to Claude
3 Opus. The decision to deprecate the API addresses a real operational
issue. This article looks at the economics of reduced-scale inference
and looks at alternative solutions that can be a win-win for both
Anthropic and independent researchers. Keeping inference access to
Claude 3 Opus is more complex than it seems at a glance. 

 A REVIEW OF ALPHA SCHOOL, THE PRIVATE SCHOOL WITH 2-HOUR DAYS AND AI
TEACHERS (74 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A parent's year-long investigation revealed the $40,000 Austin school
actually takes 3.5 hours daily with a 5:1 teacher ratio and extensive
incentive systems, not AI-powered teacher-free education as marketed.
While students do advance 2.6x faster through material using
personalized learning platforms, parents argue the real value isn't
speed, but freeing up time - it potentially gives kids ~9 additional
years outside of the classroom to pursue their own interests.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 YOUR AI-POWERED APPLICATION MIGHT ALREADY BE BROKEN (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Agents, LLMs, vector stores, custom logic. There's a lot that can go
wrong, and you'll miss most of it if your observability stops at the
model call. With Sentry's new AI and LLM monitoring [10], you'll know
exactly what AI was trying to do when your application broke, before
your users find it. See, try, or read [10] 

 MICROJAX (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Microjax is a tiny autograd engine with a Jax-like API. It was
inspired by Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd, a PyTorch-like library with
about 150 lines of code. JAX uses a more functional style, which some
developers prefer. 

 CORT (CHAIN OF RECURSIVE THOUGHTS) (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 CoRT enhances AI models by making them self-evaluate and repeatedly
generate alternatives for optimal responses. Testing with Mistral 3.1
24B showed significant performance improvements in programming tasks.
The process involves iterative response generation and selection,
leading to more refined AI outputs. 

 BITNET (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An inference framework for Microsoft's BitNet b1.58, a 1.58-bit
(ternary) large language model designed for efficient and lossless CPU
inference using optimized low-bit kernels.

 THE ‘CHATGPT MOMENT' IN ROBOTICS AND BEYOND (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Three years ago, getting a robot to reliably pick up objects required
an army of engineers. Today, a college student can download an
open-source vision-language-action model, fine-tune it on a weekend,
and achieve results that would have taken industry teams months to
accomplish. This article looks at what a 'ChatGPT moment' for robotics
would look like, the current state of the industry, upcoming
technologies, and likely winners. Being surrounded by robots in
everyday settings will feel surreal at first, but we will soon rely on
them just like we do with AI assistants for the most basic needs of
our lives. 

 REPLIT DYNAMIC INTELLIGENCE FOR REPLIT AGENT (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Replit introduced Dynamic Intelligence for its Agent, adding three
capabilities: Extended Thinking, High Power Model, and Web Search.
These enhancements improve context awareness, iterative reasoning, and
autonomous behavior, allowing the Agent to adapt and solve complex
tasks efficiently. Users can toggle these features per request,
optimizing the Agent's problem-solving capabilities for different
scenarios. 

 HUAWEI DENIES ALLEGATIONS OF COPYING ALIBABA'S AI MODEL (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 An anonymous whistleblower claiming to work at Huawei presented a
technical analysis showing that the new Pangu model was trained by
“upcycling” Alibaba's Qwen model rather than training from
scratch. Using "model fingerprinting", they calculated a 0.9
correlation coefficient between the models. The evidence isn't
conclusive - critics have pointed out flaws in the fingerprinting
methodology.
