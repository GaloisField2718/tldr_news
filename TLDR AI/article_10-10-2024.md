HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ALPHAFOLD WINS NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Demis Hassabis, John Jumper, and David Baker won the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for their contributions to protein folding with AlphaFold
among other innovations. 

 GENOMIC FOUNDATION MODEL BENCHMARKING (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GFMBench is a new framework designed to address challenges in genomic
foundation model (GFM) development by providing standardized
benchmarking tools. With millions of genomic sequences and hundreds of
tasks, GFMBench automates benchmarking for open-source GFMs. 

 OPENAI REDUCING DEPENDENCY ON MICROSOFT DATA CENTERS (1 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 OpenAI is reducing its dependence on Microsoft data centers by
securing its own compute capacity. Microsoft is also decreasing its
reliance on OpenAI as it competes in the AI product market.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLMS KNOW MORE THAN THEY SHOW: ON THE INTRINSIC REPRESENTATION OF LLM
HALLUCINATIONS (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Another study that shows language models encode internally when they
aren't factual. This evidence can help us steer them and mitigate
hallucinations. 

 DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORMER (33 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Transformers tend to over-allocate attention to irrelevant context.
This work introduces Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to
the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the
differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the
difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The
subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention
patterns 

 A SIMPLER CLIP FINE-TUNING (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This paper introduces ProLIP, a method for adapting vision-language
models like CLIP without adding extra parameters. By fine-tuning just
the last projection matrix of the vision encoder, ProLIP achieves
strong results in few-shot classification.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 THIS COMPANY IS MERGING PATENTED NEXT-GEN AI, COMPRESSION & VR
TECHNOLOGY WITH THE HIGHEST GROSSING CHARACTER IP IN HISTORY — AND
IS OFFERING INVESTORS A PIECE—FOR A LIMITED TIME (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Elf Labs [13], known for winning historic trademark cases for iconic
characters like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and the
Little Mermaid, is raising an investment round to bring them to life
using AI, AR, and VR. With two projects funded and their goal
surpassed, limited space remains. Invest before the round closes on
OCT. 30 and earn up to 40% bonus shares and exclusive investor perks!
[13] 

 SCIENCE AGENT BENCH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Benchmark code for the science agent test. This essentially serves to
measure how good models are at producing novel scientific advances. 

 CONTROLLED VISUAL GENERATION (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Controllable AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR) is a new framework that
brings precise control to pre-trained visual autoregressive models.
The approach allows fine-tuned image generation with fewer resources
by progressively refining control representations. 

 SPATIOTEMPORAL PREDICTION WITH PREDFORMER (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 PredFormer is a new transformer-based approach for spatiotemporal
predictive learning that outperforms existing methods in both accuracy
and efficiency.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TIKTOK PARENT COMPANY BYTEDANCE HAS A TOOL THAT'S SCRAPING THE WEB 25
TIMES FASTER THAN OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ByteDance is aggressively using its web crawler, Bytespider, to amass
data, potentially for developing its own LLM. Bytespider's data
consumption rate is significantly higher than its competitors,
including OpenAI and Anthropic. The purpose of the collected data
remains unclear, but TikTok has been integrating AI-powered features
like AI-generated ads and avatars. 

 SONAIR TAKES A CUE FROM DOLPHINS TO BUILD AUTONOMOUS 3D VISION
WITHOUT LIDAR (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Sonair has developed an ultrasound-based 3D computer vision
technology for autonomous hardware. Aiming to replace lidar by
offering a cost-effective and low-energy alternative, the system uses
AI for object recognition and provides a 180-degree field of view.
Sonair is initially targeting autonomous mobile robots. It recently
raised $6.8 million to support technology aimed at enhancing robot
perception. 

 AI WILL USE A LOT OF ENERGY. THAT'S GOOD FOR THE CLIMATE. (8 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 AI data centers are driving demand for clean, 24/7 energy, pushing
tech giants to invest heavily in renewable and nuclear power
solutions. This surge in demand could accelerate the cost reduction of
clean energy technologies due to their learning rates. In the long
run, AI's energy needs may spur policy changes and advancements in
clean energy infrastructure.
