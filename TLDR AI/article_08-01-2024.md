HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NABLA RAISES $24M AI DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nabla, an AI clinical notes assistant company, raised another round
of funding to continue improving its technology and accelerate sales. 

 OPENINTERPRETER GETS AN OS MODE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Open Interpreter is a great project that emulates OpenAI's
interpreter. It now also has an OS mode and a visual mode so it can
control your computer with a language model by clicking buttons and
viewing the screen. 

 WAVE OF APPLE GENERATIVE AI TOOLS ON TRACK FOR WWDC DEBUT (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Apple is set to introduce generative AI-based tools, including an
enhanced Siri, at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June as part
of iOS 18. These innovations are based on Apple's Ajax large language
model and may include features like auto-completion and summarization
for core and productivity apps, AI-assisted coding in Xcode, and
automated playlist creation in Apple Music

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 STEERING LLAMA 2 WITH CONTRASTIVE ACTIVATIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 There are lots of ways to align a language model, for example, SFT,
LoRa, RLHF, DPO, Prompting, and Threatening. This work suggests using
negative embeddings added to the bias terms to push model generations
towards a desired outcome. 

 TUNING A MODEL WITHOUT LOSING INFORMATION (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Great research that shows that adding new blocks to a language model
and then tuning it on an additional task prevents losing knowledge.
This is demonstrated in both code and language tasks. 

 TEXT-DRIVEN HUMAN MOTION SYNTHESIS WITH CASCADED DIFFUSION MODELS (18
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A framework called GUESS has been introduced for creating human
motion from text. It simplifies complex human poses into more abstract
forms at various levels, making the synthesis of motion from text more
concise and stable.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EDGE DETECTION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DiffusionEdge is a novel edge detection model that outperforms
existing methods. By integrating a diffusion probabilistic model,
DiffusionEdge delivers more accurate and crisp edge maps while being
resource-efficient. 

 ENHANCING VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS WITH PROMPTS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This project introduces a method to adapt CLIP-like vision-language
models for various tasks while retaining its generalization ability.
The approach learns prompts from LLM data, avoiding the need for
labeled images. 

 A MULTI-MODAL ASSISTANT POWERED BY PHI-2 LANGUAGE MODEL (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 LLaVA-Phi is an innovative multi-modal assistant that uses the Phi-2
language model. Despite its small size of 2.7B parameters, LLaVA-Phi
excels in multi-modal dialogues, combining text and visuals.

 A SURVEY OF 2,778 RESEARCHERS SHOW HOW FRAGMENTED THE AI SCIENCE
COMMUNITY IS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The "2023 Expert Survey on Progress in AI" reveals a scientific
community divided on the pace and impact of AI development.
Predictions of significant milestones have been reached earlier than
expected. Over half of the respondents are optimistic about AI's
impact on humanity, but concerns remain about its potential misuse,
highlighting the need for research on risk mitigation.
