RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CODEI/O: CONDENSING REASONING PATTERNS VIA CODE INPUT-OUTPUT
PREDICTION (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CodeI/O improves reasoning in large language models by converting
code into an input-output prediction format. This enhances performance
across various reasoning tasks by teaching universal reasoning
principles without relying on code syntax. Further refinement through
multi-turn revision boosts accuracy by verifying predictions. 

 PRE-TRAINING WITH CONTINUOUS CONCEPTS (27 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CoCoMix is a pretraining framework that enhances next-token
prediction by integrating continuous concepts learned from a sparse
autoencoder. It improves sample efficiency, outperforming standard
methods in language modeling and reasoning tasks. Additionally, it
enhances interpretability by allowing direct inspection and
modification of predicted concepts. 

 A MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new multiple instance learning framework for whole slide image
classification introduces a dual-scale vision-language approach, using
a prototype-guided patch decoder and a context-guided text decoder to
enhance model performance on pathology tasks.
