TECH LEADERS CALL FOR 6 MONTH PAUSE ON AI (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.npr.org/2023/03/29/1166896809/tech-leaders-urge-a-pause-in-the-out-of-control-artificial-intelligence-race?utm_source=tldrai]


A group of prominent computer scientists and industry experts,
including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, have called for a 6-month pause
to consider the risks of rolling out AI systems with
"human-competitive intelligence" that could outsmart humans. Their
petition, organized by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, warns
that such AI systems could pose profound risks to society and
humanity, including flooding the internet with disinformation,
automating away jobs, and more catastrophic future risks. While the
letter has already drawn skeptics, some governments are already
working to regulate high-risk AI tools. 

CEREBRAS RELEASES THE FIRST COMPUTE OPTIMAL GPT MODELS NOT TRAINED ON
A GPU (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230328005366/en/Cerebras-Systems-Releases-Seven-New-GPT-Models-Trained-on-CS-2-Wafer-Scale-Systems?utm_source=tldrai]


GPUs are the dominant hardware for training large scale AI models.
Many groups are trying to develop custom AI chips. Cerebras has their
CS-2 system with high throughput and on-chip memory. They claim this
work was done (111M - 13B param models) in just a few weeks due to the
power of their chips. This is contrasted to the ~5 months of the Llama
project (up to 65B params). They are trained to ‚Äúcompute
optimally‚Äù which means they are not as powerful as the Llama models
of comparable size.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

STYLEDIFFUSION: PROMPT-EMBEDDING INVERSION FOR TEXT-BASED EDITING (15
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15649?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers address limitations in pretrained diffusion models for
image editing by optimizing the input of the value linear network in
cross-attention layers and introducing attention regularization to
maintain object-like attention maps. These improvements result in
superior editing capabilities, demonstrated through extensive
experimental prompt-editing on various images. 

INTRODUCING GPT4ALL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all?utm_source=tldrai] 

GPT4All is a 7B parameter language model, trained on high-quality
assistant data and accompanied by 800K data samples, training code,
and model weights for open research and reproducibility. A 4-bit
quantized version that can run on a CPU is also provided. 

TRY OUT TEXT TO VIDEO (HUGGINGFACE SPACE)
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/PAIR/Text2Video-Zero?utm_source=tldrai]


While this demo only lets you generate 8 frames at a time, it gives
good insight into the capabilities of some of these generative video
models. There are still lots of open problems here like generation
length, consistency, and world knowledge - but things are moving
along. The computation required for generative video is much higher
than images or text, so these models tend to run slower and take
longer to train.

ADDING CONSISTENCY TO TEXT-TO-3D MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/3DFuse?utm_source=tldrai] 

Since the advent of powerful text-to-image models last year, people
have been trying to move from 2d to 3d generation. One issue is the
‚Äúmulti-view consistency‚Äù problem, where if you only see part of an
object, how do you infer what the other parts look like. Many naive
methods will copy and paste the 2d image around the object which
results in very odd images. By using a consistency injection
technique, you can leverage the semantic understanding from 2d models
to create fairly robust 3d models. The text to 3d printing pipeline is
coming! 

VIVE3D: VIEWPOINT-INDEPENDENT VIDEO EDITING USING 3D-AWARE GANS
(GITHUB REPO)
[https://afruehstueck.github.io/vive3D/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The authors present VIVE3D, a new technique that extends the
capabilities of image-based 3D GANs to video editing. It uses a novel
GAN inversion technique optimized for camera parameters and introduces
new edits that show novel views of the head using optical flow-guided
compositing to combine the head with the background video, resulting
in high-fidelity, consistent quality face edits from various camera
viewpoints. 

INSTRUCT 3D-TO-3D: TEXT INSTRUCTION GUIDED 3D-TO-3D CONVERSION (GITHUB
REPO) [https://sony.github.io/Instruct3Dto3D-doc/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Instruct 3D-to-3D, a high-quality 3D-to-3D conversion method,
leverages pretrained Image-to-Image diffusion models to transform 3D
scenes based on text instructions while maintaining consistency and
controllability. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
superior conversion quality compared to baseline methods, with the
addition of dynamic scaling for adjustable geometry transformation
intensity.

ATTENTION IS ALL YOU NEED FROM NOT BORING BY PACKY MCCORMICK (25
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.notboring.co/p/attention-is-all-you-need?utm_source=tldrai]


ChatGPT, OpenAI's increasingly powerful AI, is transforming into a
platform that could disintermediate and disrupt various industries.
With the introduction of plugins and third-party integrations, ChatGPT
can absorb the capabilities of many products, turning them into APIs
and creating a one-stop destination for users' needs. As the "Apex
Aggregator," ChatGPT is poised to streamline user experiences, reshape
consumer behavior, and force businesses to adapt, potentially
impacting margins and the way they operate. 

AI RISK DOES NOT EQUAL AGI RISK (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/ai-risk-agi-risk?utm_source=tldrai]


Gary Marcus argues that although the risks of AGI are still far away,
current AI LLM models come with their own unique and serious set of
risks.
