 GEOFF HINTON AND MAX WELLING $30M CARBON CAPTURE START UP (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Geoff Hinton and Max Welling, preeminent researchers in the field of
AI, have assembled a strong team and are working to build AI systems
that help with material science for carbon capture. 

 NVIDIA CONQUERS LATEST AI TESTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Systems powered by Nvidia's Hopper architecture dominated the results
of two new tests from MLPerf, an AI benchmarking suite that compares
the fine-tuning of large language models and training of graph neural
networks. 

 PERPLEXITY AI SEARCHES FOR USERS IN JAPAN, VIA SOFTBANK DEAL (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perplexity is leveraging its strategic partnership with SoftBank to
expand its reach in Japan. It is offering a free year of its premium
AI-powered search engine, Perplexity Pro. SoftBank aims to attract

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 UPDATING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH ERASE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ERASE is a new approach for updating language models. Unlike
traditional methods that focus on improving retrieval during
prediction, ERASE incrementally deletes or rewrites entries in the
knowledge base when new documents are added. 

 3D REPRESENTATION LEARNING FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Duoduo CLIP is a 3D representation learning model that uses
multi-view images instead of point-clouds. 

 SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH CONTENT-AWARE MIXING (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CAMixerSR performs image super-resolution by smartly applying
convolution for simpler parts and deformable window-attention for
detailed textures.

 META CHAMELEON MODELS RELEASED (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Chameleon is an early fusion model that operates on images and text
tokens simultaneously. Its team released the paper a few weeks ago.
They have now released model checkpoints along with inference code. 

 DEPTH COMPLETION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 OGNI-DC is a new framework for depth completion using
"Optimization-Guided Neural Iterations" (OGNI). It refines a depth
gradient field and integrates the depth gradients into a depth map. 

 SUBOBJECT TOKENIZATION FOR IMAGES (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Subobject tokenization is a new way for vision models to understand
images. Instead of breaking images into fixed square patches, models
using subobject tokenization look at images in terms of meaningful
segments, like parts of objects.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN INTERPRETER LOCAL III (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Open source local agent Open Interpreter has just had a big upgrade.
It can control the computer seamlessly and works completely offline

 INTRODUCING THE PROPERTY GRAPH INDEX (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 LlamaIndex introduces the Property Graph Index, enhancing knowledge
graph capabilities with better modeling, storage, and querying
features. The new index allows flexible construction of graphs,
supports schema-guided, implicit, and free-form entity extraction, and
integrates with vector databases for hybrid searches. It provides
querying through keyword expansion, vector similarity, Cypher queries,
and custom traversal. 

 IBM GRANITE CODE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Open models with state-of-the-art code performance that do depth
upscaling to initialize larger models. Unlike many code models, these
models also excel at fixing code, explaining code, and evaluating
areas for improvement.
