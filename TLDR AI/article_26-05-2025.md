Some developers are already switching to a tool-use paradigm, but this
is still limited to very short contexts and to only parts of the model
output. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌  ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌

 NOT EVERY DISRUPTOR WEARS A HOODIE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Some wear grit, results — and a NASDAQ ticker.

Meet Jeremy Barnett, CEO of RAD Intel, the pre-IPO AI company backed
by Adobe, Fidelity, and tech insiders from Google, Meta, Amazon, and
YouTube.

RAD is up 1600%, delivering 3.5x ROI [4] for brands like Hasbro and
MGM — and just secured its ticker: $RADI.

That momentum is powered by RAD's AI, which predicts what wins
_before_ it launches [4] — already driving six-figure campaigns
across beauty, retail, and entertainment.

Sales contracts have doubled in 2025, with new activations lined up
for Sephora, Home Depot, and Anthropologie.

Shares are $0.60 until May 29. Get in now — before the price moves.

 NVIDIA TO LAUNCH CHEAPER BLACKWELL AI CHIP FOR CHINA AFTER US EXPORT
CURBS, SOURCES SAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia plans to launch a new artificial intelligence chipset for
China at a significantly lower price than its recently restricted H20
model. The company has scheduled mass production to begin as early as
June. The new chips will be priced between $6,500 and $8,000, well
below the $10,000 to $12,000 the H20 sold for. The lower price
reflects its weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing
requirements.

 INFINITE TOOL USE (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Large language models should never output anything but tool calls and
their arguments. Exclusively working through tools allows models to
externalize large parts of their intelligence to more efficient
domain-specific programs. Some developers are already switching to a
tool-use paradigm, but this is still limited to very short contexts
and to only parts of the model output. This post provides examples of
how the tool-use paradigm benefits different domains, like text
editing, video understanding, and 3D generation.

 GENAI'S ADOPTION PUZZLE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ChatGPT usage grew amazingly fast - much faster than PCs, the web, or
smartphones. However, it was just a website - people didn't need to go
buy a new device or wait for infrastructure to be deployed. Despite
its advantages, ChatGPT's daily active users to weekly active users
ratio is pretty bad. This may fix itself over time as models mature
and more use cases emerge. The chatbot interface might only be working
for some people and some use cases, so it might be better to wrap
features and capabilities inside other things. 

 ORACLE WILL BUY $40B IN NVIDIA CHIPS FOR OPENAI'S STARGATE (2 MINUTE
READ) [14]
