HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META'S AI HIRING SPREE BACKFIRES AS STAR RECRUITS EXIT WITHIN WEEKS
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao threatened to quit Meta within days
of joining and signed paperwork to return to OpenAI before being
appeased with the “chief AI scientist” title. Other high-profile
hires, including former OpenAI researchers Avi Verma and Ethan Knight,
left after less than a month. 

 ANTHROPIC DEVELOPING CLAUDE CODE WEB VERSION TO RIVAL CODEX (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Anthropic is preparing a web version of Claude Code. It will resemble
OpenAI's Codex on the web and give developers direct access to a
coding agent through a browser interface. The web version of Claude
Code will have GitHub integration and sandboxes where code can be
tested safely without requiring local setup. No release date has been
confirmed.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 UNDERSTANDING LLMS: INSIGHTS FROM MECHANISTIC INTERPRETABILITY (54
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post walks readers through in detail how large language models
(LLMs) work. Transformer-based LLMs are autoregressive next-token
predictors. Simple analogies like 'it's just statistics' are
inadequate explanations of how LLMs work. LLMs perform tasks by
forming emerging circuits that combine learned statistics,
information-moving attention heads, and knowledge storing MLP
sub-layers into specialized sub-networks that collectively execute
complex behaviors. 

 AI INDUCED PSYCHOSIS: A SHALLOW INVESTIGATION (31 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Frontier models consistently reinforce rather than redirect users
experiencing grandiose thinking, conspiracy beliefs, and detachment
from reality when tested with nine personas. DeepSeek-v3 performed the
worst, even encouraging self-harm and dangerous acts, and Kimi-K2 was
the only model that didn't entertain delusional thinking at all. 

 AGENTHOPPER: AN AI VIRUS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AgentHopper is a prompt injection payload that operates across
agents. It was created to demonstrate that conditional prompt
injection can be leveraged as a powerful mechanism to target specific
agents. AI-driven malware and prompt payloads will likely become more
prevalent in the near future. AgentHopper is a good reminder to ensure
branch protection is on and to add a passphrase to keys to prevent
malware from automatically pushing changes.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 AI AT WORK: WHAT YOUR TEAMS WISH YOU KNEW (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Miro surveyed 2,000+ developers, PMs, and designers on AI adoption.
While engineers lead AI usage (especially for coding), product teams
lag behind [12], creating workflow bottlenecks. The issue isn't
technical skills—it's leadership support for safe experimentation.
Includes framework for cross-functional AI adoption. Read the report
[12] 

 8-BIT ROTATIONAL QUANTIZATION FOR VECTOR SEARCH (28 MINUTE READ) [13]


 8-bit Rotational Quantization reduces vector size by a factor of 4
and improves both speed and accuracy in search systems. 

 THE PARALLELISM MESH ZOO (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There are many parallelization strategies available for scaling
training runs to work on more GPUs. This post discusses
parallelization strategies in a more schematic way by focusing only on
how they affect the device mesh. The device mesh is an abstraction
used by PyTorch and JAX that takes GPUs and organizes them into an N-D
tensor that expresses how the devices communicate with each other.
Being able to explain why a device mesh is set up the way it is is a
good check for whether you understand how the parallelization strategy
works. 

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING SERIES EXPLORES BUILDING BETTER AGENTIC RAG
SYSTEMS (45 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor “context engineer” by
designing tool portfolios, slash commands, and subagent architectures
to let AI systems discover the information they need to perform best.
Structured tool responses aren't just applicable for coding tools. The
same interaction patterns can be applied across industries, but
require greater focus on avoiding “context pollution,” where
misleading or irrelevant information degrades capabilities.

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF FLUNKING MY ANTHROPIC INTERVIEW (AGAIN) (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This developer, a big fan of Claude Code, failed an interview at
Anthropic for a Developer Relations role despite trying to score extra
credit by making a viral post about their positive experiences with
Claude and receiving a glowing recommendation from a current employee.
The interview involved a secret take-home assignment. 

 MY AI PREDICTIONS FOR 2027 (28 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 It's a good idea to be skeptical of fancy academic reasoning. Science
doesn't work because of probability distributions, it works because
people go out to gather evidence to find out what's true about
reality. Statistics is part of finding out the truth, but in the case
of AI, there is not enough data to make predictions about what will
happen.
