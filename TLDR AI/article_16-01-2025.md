HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S BOARD, PARAPHRASED: ‘TO SUCCEED, ALL WE NEED IS
UNIMAGINABLE SUMS OF MONEY' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's shift from a public-benefit focus to for-profit resembles
the early transitional story of Netscape as it leads the AI chatbot
market but lacks a sustainable technical moat, suggesting funding is
driven by an investment bubble. Despite already raising significant
capital, OpenAI's board claims the need for even more funding,
mirroring patterns of an unsustainable financial model. 

 DEEPSEEK: THE QUIET GIANT LEADING CHINA'S AI RACE (26 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Deepseek, a Chinese AI startup led by CEO Liang Wenfeng, has
developed a model, the R1, that outperformed OpenAI's O1 on reasoning
benchmarks. With backing from the quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer,
Deepseek prioritizes research over commercialization and is committed
to open sourcing. It has triggered price competition in China's AI
market by offering affordable API rates. Focused on AGI, Deepseek
emphasizes architectural innovations like Multi-Head Latent Attention
and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts, challenging traditional models and
fostering local talent in China's tech scene. 

 CHATGPT NOW LETS YOU SCHEDULE REMINDERS AND RECURRING TASKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 OpenAI has introduced a "tasks" feature for ChatGPT that allows paid
users to set reminders and recurring requests. This beta lets the AI
schedule notifications, such as weekend plans based on location or
daily news briefings, marking a step towards more autonomous AI
agents. The feature is initially available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and
Pro users, with expansion plans underway. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MINIMAX 4M CONTEXT LENGTH MODEL (34 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The next frontier level model from China uses a novel lightning
attention. It is the first linear variant that achieves competitive
performance with some of the best frontier models. The model has 400B+
parameters and was trained with 4 million tokens in context. The
researchers have released a strong technical report, model weights,
and a code repository. There is also a companion vision model. 

 METADATA CONDITIONING ACCELERATES LANGUAGE MODEL PRE-TRAINING (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Not a lot of research in generic pre training has been published
recently. This work shows how including metadata in the first of
training and annealing it out towards the end improves overall model
performance. 

 BENCHMARKING LLMS IN WEB TRAVERSAL (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Alibaba's WebWalker is a benchmark that tests how well models can
navigate web environments using both visual and textual cues. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MANGANINJIA PRECISE RECOLORING TOOL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MangaNinjia is a set of models for precise sketch coloring. It can
handle multiple references, partial references, and a variety of
configurations for powerful colorization. 

 MEDICAL SEGMENTATION BENCHMARK (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Touchstone is a new large-scale benchmark designed to test AI
algorithms on medical imaging more effectively than standard
benchmarks. It contains over 11,000 CT scans from hospitals worldwide.


 RELIABLE HARDWARE VERIFICATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This project introduces an ML approach to model checking for hardware
verification. It aims to provide formal guarantees that a system's
executions meet specified temporal logic requirements. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 1 STEP VIDEO GENERATION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This research uses an adversarial post training technique to
transform an existing video model into a single step generation
system. It works quite well using an adversarial post training
technique that seems to approximate consistency tuning. The resulting
model can generate 2 seconds of high quality video in real time. Note,
the website is slow to load due to the high amount of videos. 

 RIFFING ON MACHINES OF LOVING GRACE (21 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Dario Amodei's vision of "geniuses in a datacenter" suggests
superhuman AI could revolutionize biology, from molecular design to
experimental planning. Such AI could dramatically accelerate progress,
particularly in molecular engineering, by overcoming current
bottlenecks and unlocking new therapeutic platforms. These systems
could also lead to paradigm-shifting discoveries, challenging existing
scientific frameworks. 

 SILICON VALLEY'S TURN OF FORTUNE: INTEL HAS WORST YEAR EVER, WHILE
BROADCOM ENJOYS RECORD GAIN (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Intel's stock plummeted 61% in 2024 due to its failure to capitalize
on the AI wave, while Broadcom thrived with a 111% increase fueled by
custom chips for major tech firms. Broadcom's XPUs have become crucial
in the AI ecosystem, with collaborations with Google and others,
whereas Intel struggles with outdated strategies and leadership
changes. The contrasting fortunes highlight pivotal tech industry
shifts and the significant market impact of AI advancements.
