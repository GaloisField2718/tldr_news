HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GROK 2 ANNOUNCED FOR AUGUST (1 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 xAI's next model is slated for August. It reportedly took 20k H100s
to train. Grok 3 is rumored for the end of the year and potentially
requires 100k H100s. 

 NVIDIA CEO JENSEN HUANG ADDRESSES RISING COMPETITION AT SHAREHOLDER
MEETING AFTER HISTORIC STOCK SURGE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang attributes the company's AI chip market
dominance, maintaining an over 80% market share despite rising
competition, to a decade-old strategic investment. Advocating for
Nvidia's AI chips' cost-effectiveness and performance, Huang
highlights the firm's transformation into a data center-focused entity
and expansion into new markets. 

 PERSONA'S FOUNDERS ARE CERTAIN THE WORLD CAN USE ANOTHER HUMANOID
ROBOT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jerry Pratt, former CTO of Figure, has partnered with Nic Radford,
former president and CEO of Nauticus Robotics, Inc., to found Persona
AI, a new humanoid robotics firm in early development. Despite a
saturated market, Persona aims to attract investors and 10 to 20
founder-level employees with a vision strongly resting on current AI
breakthroughs in perception algorithms, onboard electronics, and
machine learning. The startup distinguishes itself by choosing
headquarters in Houston and Pensacola rather than traditional robotics
hubs.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SIMPLE DIFFUSION LANGUAGE MODELS (15 MINUTE VIDEO) [7] 

 Great lecture from Sasha Rush, a professor at Cornell Tech and
researcher at Hugging Face, about using diffusion as an objective for
language modeling. 

 KYUTAI MOSHI (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kyutai, a French open research lab, has trained a pure audio LLM with
minimal latency. It has managed to create a really impressive demo
that will be open sourced in the coming months. 

 3D RECONSTRUCTION FROM BLURRY IMAGES (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers have developed a method to reconstruct 3D scenes from a
single blurry image using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and event
streams. This innovative approach models camera motion and synthesizes
brightness changes, enabling high-quality, view-consistent images from
blurry inputs without needing pre-computed camera poses.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AGENTLESS SWE-BENCH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Work that can solve 24%+ on SWE-bench with just a language model and
no agents. 

 ACCELERATING LONG-SEQUENCE PROCESSING (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MInference is a new method that accelerates the processing of long
prompts in large language models. It uses sparse computation
techniques to overcome the significant delays caused by traditional
methods. 

 ADVANCING ALZHEIMER'S DIAGNOSIS WITH EXPLAINABLE AI (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 This project proposes a new method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease
using 3D MRI scans that enhances the explainability of model
decisions. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 TORCH COMPILE, THE MISSING MANUAL (65 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Manual for resolving torch.compile errors to make your code run
faster. 

 HOW TO WIN AT ENTERPRISE AI‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA PLAYBOOK (24 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This AI-focused playbook outlines strategies for enterprise adoption
of AI, highlighting the shift from human-performed services to
software-driven workflows termed "Service-as-a-software." It delves
into the implications for business models, such as performance-based
pricing, and emphasizes the importance of workflow capture and AI
accuracy for successful implementation. The guide also discusses
threats like lateral attacks and stresses the need for AI to
demonstrate clear performance, not just promise, in enterprise
settings. 

 AI IS DISRUPTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT. SALESFORCE IS FEELING THE PINCH
(10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Enterprises shifting IT budgets toward AI proof-of-concept projects
challenge customer support software companies like Salesforce and
Zendesk. The growing integration of tools like ChatGPT in customer
support has increased customer acquisition costs for traditional
software providers, extending payback periods. The future investment
in customer support software depends on these companies' innovation
and the broader macroeconomic environment.
