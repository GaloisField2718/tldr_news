 üÜï NYLAS + AI: AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACT INSIGHTS FROM CUSTOMER EMAILS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Email is one of the main ways companies communicate with customers
‚Äî but very few companies know how to parse unstructured email text
into useful data [4].

Nylas has the critical infrastructure you need to:

 	* Apply customized AI to parse email inboxes [4], making it 12x
faster to make your email data AI or LLM ready.
 	* Extract, filter, and normalize email data [4], securely and
cost-effectively ‚Äî i.e. without sending your customers' emails to
3rd party LLMs!
 	* Manage integrations with all email providers [4] using a single
API.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 A RIGHT TO WARN ABOUT ADVANCED AI (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A group of current and former AI employees is calling for advanced AI
companies to commit to principles that ensure transparency and
protection for employees who raise risk-related concerns. They
highlight the need for companies to avoid enforcing non-disparagement
agreements, facilitate anonymous reporting processes, support open
criticism, and prevent retaliation against whistleblowers. 

 WILL SCALING SOLVE ROBOTICS? (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 900 people attended last year's Conference on Robot Learning,
which featured 11 workshops and almost 200 accepted papers. One of the
largest debates at the event was whether training a large neural
network on a very large data set was a feasible way to solve robotics.
This post presents the different sides of the argument to deepen
people's understanding of the debate. Scaling has worked for other
similar fields. However, it is impractical as there isn't much
robotics data available and there's no clear way to get it. Even if
scaling works as well as in other fields, it likely still won't solve
robotics. 

 THE OPAQUE INVESTMENT EMPIRE MAKING OPENAI'S SAM ALTMAN RICH (15
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sam Altman is one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and aggressive
individual investors. He manages an investment empire with holdings
worth at least $2.8 billion as of early this year. Much of the
portfolio isn't widely known. This article takes readers through
what's known about Altman's investments.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MMLU PRO (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MMLU is a common benchmark for reasoning tasks. It is often
considered to be both the gold standard and something models have
overfit. MMLU Pro is a new, harder, and cleaner benchmark for
measuring language model reasoning. 

 TREE DIFFUSION: DIFFUSION MODELS FOR CODE (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fantastic diffusion paper that diffuses code for images. It can
directly make edits as part of the diffusion process. It is slow, but
can be combined easily with search to dramatically improve reasoning
ability. 

 JAILBREAKING OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have introduced improved methods for optimization-based
jailbreaking of large language models, building on the Greedy
Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack.

 WHAT IS RAG? ‚Äî A NEO4J BLOG (SPONSOR) [11] 

 A chatbot can sound human AND provide detailed, precise answers.
Check out this blog from Neo4j about how retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) IMPROVES YOUR LLM'S RESPONSES [11]. Learn about use
cases where RAG made a huge difference in making a chatbot's answers
more relevant and accurate. READ THE BLOG NOW. [11] 

 OMOST IMAGE SYNTHESIS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 From the creator of ControlNet, Omost is a way to gain control over
your image generation. It first rewrites prompts as a set of
descriptive code. Then it uses that to render the final image.
Importantly, you can edit the code before or after generation to
slightly change the model output. 

 IMPROVED VIDEO SUPER RESOLUTION (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Researchers have developed a training-free video interpolation method
for generative video diffusion models. This new approach, compatible
with various models, enhances frame rates without the need for
extensive training or large datasets. 

 IMAGE COMPRESSION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Control-GIC is a new framework for generative image compression that
allows fine-grained bitrate adjustment while maintaining high-quality
results.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLM INFERENCE SPEED OF LIGHT (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using theoretical speed of light modeling as grounding is really
important for problems where the amount of computation and memory
access is known a priori as it helps validate the quality of
implementations and predict the impact of architectural changes. 

 PLENTIFUL, HIGH-PAYING JOBS IN THE AGE OF AI (20 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 It's possible that many of the jobs that humans do today will
continue to be done by humans indefinitely, no matter how much better
AIs are at those jobs, due to comparative advantage. 

 WHAT I LEARNED FROM LOOKING AT 900 MOST POPULAR OPEN SOURCE AI TOOLS
(13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This review of open source AI repositories aims to give readers a
big-picture view of the seemingly overwhelming AI ecosystem.

 Prevent fraud and spoofing attacks with advanced facial recognition
technology. 

 EVEN THE RASPBERRY PI IS GETTING IN ON AI (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Raspberry Pi is launching an AI chip integrated with its camera
software that will allow AI applications like chatbots to run natively
on the microcomputer. 

 USING AI TO DECODE DOC VOCALIZATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 University of Michigan researchers, in collaboration with Mexico's
INAOE, have developed AI tools that analyze dog barks to determine
playfulness or aggression, as well as identify the dog's breed, age,
and sex.
