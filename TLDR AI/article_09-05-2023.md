HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

MILLION DOLLAR AI FINE-TUNING CHALLENGE (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.chai-research.com/competition.html?utm_source=tldrai] 

Think of this like Kaggle but for fine tuning a language model. We
want to improve the safety of these models, and so we are relying on
the community now to see if we can make progress. There are compute
partnerships available and a reward model that you can use. The
competition starts on June 10th. 

GOOGLE TO ANNOUNCE PALM 2 (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/google-io-to-feature-ai-updates-showing-off-palm-2-llm.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Artificial intelligence is going to be a central theme at Google‚Äôs
annual developer conference on Wednesday, as the company is planning
to announce a number of generative AI updates, including launching a
general-use large language model (LLM), CNBC has learned. 

FAIR USE AND MODEL TRAINING, GETTY IMAGES VS. STABLE DIFFUSION (14
MINUTE READ)
[https://stratechery.com/2023/fair-use-and-model-training-getty-images-vs-stable-diffusion-adobes-regulatory-capture-bet/?utm_source=tldrai]


Universal Music Group (UMG) has requested streaming platforms like
Spotify and Apple to block AI services from scraping melodies and
lyrics from copyrighted songs. UMG is concerned about AI bots using
their songs to generate music that resembles popular artists,
potentially affecting the market for the original artists. However, it
is unclear if using copyrighted material for model training is
illegal, as it may fall under the fair use exception to copyright.
Meanwhile, Adobe is betting on a narrow fair use definition that
excludes AI models, as it owns a large stock photo library and has
relationships with risk-averse corporations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LEARNING DECISION TREES WITH GRADIENT DESCENT (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03515?utm_source=tldrai] 

Decision Trees are a type of artificial intelligence that make
decisions based on data, but the current method of creating these
trees can sometimes give us less than perfect results. This paper
talks about a new method using something called gradient descent,
which helps us to build better Decision Trees and get more accurate
results for tasks where the AI needs to categorize things. 

COMPOSE OBJECTS LOCALIZED WITH ATTRIBUTES (29 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03689?utm_source=tldrai] 

Compositional reasoning helps us understand complex visuals by
combining objects and their features, but current AI models struggle
with this. Researchers created a benchmark called Cola to test and
improve these AI models, finding that a lightweight multi-modal
adapter helps the models reason about images and language better. 

ENHANCING WEBPAGE UNDERSTANDING WITH A NOVEL ATTENTION MECHANISM (17
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03668?utm_source=tldrai] 

Webpages offer a lot of information for AI tasks, but they haven't
been used to their full potential. The new Wikipedia Webpage suite
(WikiWeb2M) helps study multimodal webpage understanding by
introducing 2 million pages and a special attention mechanism that
improves performance on tasks like generating descriptions,
summarizing sections, and creating contextual image captions.
