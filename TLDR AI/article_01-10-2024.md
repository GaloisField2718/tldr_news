 AI WILL NOT REPLACE HUMAN CODE REVIEWERS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While rule-based code reviewers have been around for some time, AI
code reviews [4] are new and getting tons of attention. Many believe
them to not only be a step-function change over predecessors like
SonarQube, but a valid replacement of human code reviewers.

In this blog post [4], Daksh Gupta ‚Äî co-founder of Greptile, an AI
dev tools company ‚Äî attempts to understand what the code review
process actually is, and if it will ever be automated away as so many
AI companies claim it will.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI REPORTEDLY SLATED FOR $500 MILLION SOFTBANK INVESTMENT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SoftBank plans to invest $500 million in OpenAI's funding round,
boosting its valuation to potentially $150 billion. Microsoft is also
participating in the round, which reflects OpenAI's 1,700% revenue
growth despite a projected $5 billion in losses. 

 OPENAI IS GROWING FAST AND BURNING THROUGH PILES OF MONEY (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI's recent financial documents reveal $300 million in monthly
revenue, a 1,700% increase since early 2023, with annual sales
projected to reach $3.7 billion. Despite this growth, the company
expects to lose approximately $5 billion this year due to high
operational costs. OpenAI is seeking $7 billion in a new funding
round, which will value the company at $150 billion. 

 ALTMAN REPORTEDLY TRYING TO SELL BIDEN ON A SLEW OF AI DCS (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is urging the Biden administration to build AI
data centers consuming up to five gigawatts of power to maintain US
technological leadership over China. The plan details constructing
multiple data centers in the US. Other tech giants, like Microsoft and
Amazon, are also securing nuclear power agreements to support their AI
operations.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EMU 3 OPEN EARLY FUSION MULTIMODAL MODEL (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Emu 3 is a next token prediction model that outperforms SDXL on image
synthesis, LlaVa-1.6 on image understanding, and OpenSora 2 on Video
generation. It is a 9B parameter model trained on all these tasks in
an interleaved manner, similar to Gemini. 

 IMPROVED ADAPTION OF PRETRAINED PRIORS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Using a pretrained diffusion model for tasks like depth estimation is
extremely popular and powerful. This work shows how some of the
previous methods were slightly wrong and improves performance while
dramatically simplifying the modeling process. 

 ENHANCED PLACE RECOGNITION (39 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SegVLAD is an approach for visual place recognition that focuses on
image segments rather than entire images. 

üßë‚Äçüíª 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LEAN RL FROM PYTORCH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A fork of CleanRL that has been optimized to use PyTorch's newest
performance and stability features. It is dramatically faster while
also being simpler to understand and extend. 

 REDUCING REDUNDANCY IN LLMS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 MaskLLM is a pruning method that reduces computational overhead in
large language models by applying learnable sparsity. 

 NEW BENCHMARK FOR VIDEO LANGUAGE MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 E.T. Bench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate video language
models on fine-grained, event-level tasks. Unlike previous benchmarks
that focus on video-level questions, E.T. Bench covers a range of
time-sensitive tasks across multiple domains.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN MACHINES SEE FACES IN OBJECTS? (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers explore how AI detects "illusory" faces‚Äîseeing faces in
inanimate objects‚Äîusing a new dataset. 

 TABLE EXTRACTION USING LLMS: UNLOCKING STRUCTURED DATA FROM DOCUMENTS
(30 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article highlights how large language models (LLMs) are
revolutionizing table extraction from complex documents, overcoming
the limitations of traditional methods like OCR, rule-based systems,
and machine learning. LLMs demonstrate flexibility and contextual
understanding, notably enhancing accuracy in diverse and intricate
table structures. Despite challenges like hallucination and high
resource demands, combining traditional techniques with LLMs is
currently the most effective strategy for automated table extraction. 

 THE OTHER BUBBLE (40 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft considered reallocating its US-based server power to GPUs
for AI but ultimately scrapped the plan. Big Tech companies, including
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, heavily invest in AI but primarily see
underwhelming returns in generative AI applications. The industry's
reliance on SaaS and the integration of AI tools, which often add
little genuine utility while incurring high costs, highlights a
growing desperation to maintain growth amidst a slowing market.
