HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT LAUNCHES COPILOT PRO (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft has launched Copilot Pro, a premium version of its Bing
Chat experience, priced at $20 per month per user. This advanced
version integrates across devices, offers access to Microsoft 365
apps, features the latest AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, and
includes enhanced AI image creation. 

 HOW OPENAI IS APPROACHING 2024 WORLDWIDE ELECTIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 OpenAI is gearing up for the 2024 elections by preventing AI abuse,
enhancing transparency in AI-generated content, and ensuring access to
reliable voting information, thereby safeguarding election integrity.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ENHANCING SEARCH SKILLS OF LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have developed INTERS, a new dataset designed to improve
how large language models like LLaMA and Mistral handle information
retrieval tasks. 

 CONVFORMER: AN EFFICIENT APPROACH FOR IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION (12
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper Introduces ConvFormer, a novel Convolutional Transformer
layer designed for lightweight image super-resolution tasks. This new
technique effectively replaces self-attention modules with large
kernel convolutions, allowing for efficient modeling of long-range
dependencies with minimal computational costs. 

 EFFICIENT BIOMEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 A new graph relation distillation technique improves instance
segmentation. This method efficiently transfers knowledge from larger,
complex networks to smaller, high-performing ones, focusing on three
key areas: instance features, their relationships, and pixel-level
boundaries.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 CODY, SOURCEGRAPH‚ÄôS CONTEXT-AWARE CODING ASSISTANT, IS NOW GA. CODE
MORE, TYPE LESS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Cody is your new favorite teammate, using its deep understanding [10]
of your codebase to explain, fix, and help you write code.
Sourcegraph‚Äôs code graph [10] allows Cody to autocomplete, explain,
and edit your code with much richer context [10].

Combined with AI-powered chat, Cody removes blockers when taking on
tricky problems or jumping into unfamiliar code [10], answering
questions like ‚ÄúHow is this repository structured?‚Äù or even
generating unit tests and documentation for you.

 AUDIO-VISUAL EMOTION RECOGNITION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 HiCMAE is a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to
enhance Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition (AVER). This approach
overcomes data scarcity challenges by using large-scale pre-training
on unlabeled audio-visual data. 

 ADVANCING LLM COMPRESSION WITH ADDITIVE QUANTIZATION (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 This project suggests a new compression technique for LLMs using
Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). The method, adapted from Additive
Quantization, sets a new standard in LLM compression, achieving higher
accuracy at lower bit counts. 

 POINT-BASED IMAGE EDITING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project introduces RotationDrag, a new method that improves
point-based image editing, especially when users want to rotate
elements within the image. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 NOUS HERMES 2 MIXTRAL (X THREAD) [15] 

 Nous Research has released SFT and DPO versions of the powerful
Mixtral model. It excels at a number of tasks and is freely available
on the Together API. 

 AI WILL TRANSFORM THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. LET‚ÄôS MAKE SURE IT BENEFITS
HUMANITY (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) stands to
revolutionize productivity and growth globally, but also poses risks
of job displacement and increased inequality. An IMF analysis shows
that nearly 40% of global employment could be impacted by AI, with
advanced economies facing both higher risks and opportunities compared
to emerging markets and developing countries. 

 AI IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO ALL OUR EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES (9 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The rapid evolution of AI in education is promising, yet it's
unlikely to solve pressing educational problems soon, as experienced
during a week-long experiential learning trip with 9th graders. While
AI offers innovative curriculum and learning enhancement, addressing
deeper issues like emotional well-being, student engagement, and trust
in education remains crucial.

QUICK LINKS

 USING AI, NLP, AND LANGUAGE MODELS TO TRACK INVESTOR ATTENTION AND
MARKET VOLATILITY (SPONSOR) [18] 

 In a recent panel hosted by Dow Jones Factiva, experts from academia
and industry discussed novel ways to generate alpha from financial
news. Read the highlights [18] 

 AUTO GGUF QUANTIZATION (COLAB NOTEBOOK) [19] 

 GGUF is a format for running models with llama cpp and supports a
number of quantization types. This notebook automates the
quantization, which may not work in the general case, but works for
most models. 

 A MULTIMODAL GROUNDING MODEL FOR IMPROVED COMPREHENSION ACROSS MEDIA
(3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 LEGO, a new end-to-end multimodal grounding model, demonstrates
advanced abilities in comprehending and grounding tasks across
different modalities like images, audio, and videos.
