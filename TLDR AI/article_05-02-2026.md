 WHO'S ACTUALLY REVIEWING ALL THAT AI-GENERATED CODE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When devs use AI to generate thousands of lines of unverified code,
you risk a codebase slopocalypse. The review step becomes your team's
bottleneck.

GREPTILE [4] reviews each PR with full repo context and learns your
team's conventions over time from comments, reactions, and what gets
merged. It flags issues and suggests fixes that match YOUR TEAM, not
generic best practices.

✅ Trusted by engineering teams at NVIDIA, SCALE AI, AND BREX. [5]

✅ Now integrated with Claude Code: install via /plugin.

✅ Free for open source.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE'S GEMINI APP HAS SURPASSED 750M MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users. The AI
chatbot has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space. It had
650 million monthly active users last quarter. In comparison, MetaAI
has reported nearly 500 million monthly users, and ChatGPT had an
estimated 810 million monthly active users in late 2025. 

 META SAYS ITS NEXT-GEN AI MODEL, AVOCADO, IS ITS “MOST CAPABLE
PRE-TRAINED BASE MODEL TO DATE” (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta's Avocado model reportedly outperforms top open-source base
models. Meta is seeing 10x compute efficiency wins with the model on
text-related tasks compared to Maverick and over 100x efficiency gains
over Behemoth, a version of Llama 4 that the company delayed last
year. The model has now finished pretraining.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 INSIDE THE CODEX APP SERVER (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI detailed the architecture of the Codex App Server, a
bidirectional JSON-RPC API layer powering Codex across platforms,
offering tips for integrating coding agents into real workflows. 

 KIMI K2.5 (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Kimi K2.5 is a solid model and exceeds expectations. It is likely now
the leading open weights model. The model is excellent given its
price. It is an excellent choice for developers who can't afford or
don't want to pay for Opus 4.5 and have to go with something cheaper
to run their OpenClaw. 

 AI IS FINALLY EATING SOFTWARE'S TOTAL MARKET: HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI's rise is shrinking the software market, causing unpredictability
for SaaS companies. Key players like Salesforce and SAP are
integrating AI functionality into popular platforms to adapt, while
weaker firms face potential obsolescence. Success hinges on owning
intent gateways and effectively leveraging AI for outcomes,
positioning few companies to thrive amid industry-wide disruption.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 GIVE ANY AI AGENT ACCESS TO GOOGLE SEARCH WITH SERPAPI (SPONSOR) [11]


 Agents are smarter when they can search the web - but with SerpApi,
you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Build with the same web search
API [11] used by ahrefs, NVIDIA, and Perplexity. Integrate with a
dead-simple GET request that any agent can make. Start with 250 free
credits/month [11] 

 MISTRAL INTRODUCES VOXTRAL TRANSCRIBE 2 (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Mistral's Voxtral Transcribe 2 is a pair of next-gen speech-to-text
models, including a real-time version with open weights that delivers
sub-200ms latency and low-cost, high-accuracy transcription across 13
languages. 

 CLAUDE AND CODEX ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN PUBLIC PREVIEW ON GITHUB (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex are now available for Copilot
Pro+ and Enterprise customers on GitHub in public preview. Users can
start sessions and assign tasks to these coding agents from the web,
mobile app, or VS Code without additional subscriptions. All agent
actions, like drafting pull requests and task prioritization, can be
managed through GitHub's existing infrastructure. 

 WINDSURF TAB V2: 25-75% MORE ACCEPTED CODE WITH VARIABLE AGGRESSION
(7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Windsurf's Tab feature was very well received, but it wasn't well
maintained after launch. The team has now significantly improved the
underlying model and context/data engineering pipeline. This has led
to direct Pareto improvements across all of Windsurf's metrics, with
an average 54% increase in characters per predict. Tab now uses
variable aggression to tailor the experience to each user's
preferences.

 OWNING A $5M DATA CENTER (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 comma has been running its own data center for years. All of the
company's model training, metrics, and data live inside its own data
center in its own office. This post describes how comma's data center
works. It is aimed at inspiring other companies to build their own
data centers too. 

 WHY NVIDIA BUILDS OPEN MODELS WITH BRYAN CATANZARO (64 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Nvidia's focus on building open models, spearheaded by efforts like
the Nemotron 3 Nano release, positions it uniquely to enhance both its
product offerings and the AI ecosystem. Open model development aids
Nvidia in understanding compute-heavy AI workloads, which informs
their hardware and software design, while fostering greater community
collaboration. Nvidia distinguishes itself by emphasizing open data
and models to drive AI infrastructure, benefiting businesses without
AI acting as an overarching monopolistic event.
