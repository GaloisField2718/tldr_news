82% OF AMERICANS THINK WE SHOULD SLOW DOWN AI DEVELOPMENT (7 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.axios.com/2023/08/09/ai-voters-trust-government-regulation?utm_source=tldrai]


In a new Axios survey of 1001 people across one week in July,
participants expressed their opinions on a variety of topics around AI
safety and capabilities development. 52% think there needs to be
government regulation and a vast majority more believe large tech
giants can't be trusted to self regulate.

Anthropic has released Claude Instant, an updated version of its
faster, cheaper, text-generating model. Claude Instant generates
longer, more structured responses, follows formatting instructions
better, and shows improvements in quote extraction, multilingual
capabilities, and question answering. It is available through an API. 

INWORLD AI BECOMES THE BEST-FUNDED STARTUP IN AI X GAMING (8 MINUTE
READ)
[https://inworld.ai/blog/inworld-valued-at-500-million?utm_source=tldrai]


Inworld AI announced a new $50M+ round led by Lightspeed Venture
Partners, bringing the total valuation of the company to over $500M.

UNDERSTANDING GROKKING (21 MINUTE READ)
[https://pair.withgoogle.com/explorables/grokking/?utm_source=tldrai] 

The PAIR group at Google has released a lovely explainer that goes
deep into the topic of Grokking. Grokking is the dynamic process a
model goes through during training that may point to a shift from
memorizing to understanding. It isn't well understood in general, but
this is a lovely introduction that covers much of the groundwork for
this strange phenomenon. 

PHOTOREALISTIC SYNTHETIC DATA IN UNREAL ENGINE (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03977?utm_source=tldrai] 

Don't have millions of photorealistic images to train your algorithm?
Maybe you can generate them using PUG from Meta AI. It uses the
powerful unreal game engine in a controllable way to generate
synthetic image data for downstream training. 

SIMPLE SYNTHETIC DATA REDUCES SYCOPHANCY (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03958?utm_source=tldrai] 

Sycophancy is when a model repeats and adopts a user's opinion. This
happens more in larger models and instruction-tuned models. It can
also occur in tasks when the opinion is irrelevant, leading to
bubble-like behavior. Simple synthetic data fine-tuning can prevent
this without harming overall performance.

A NEW METHOD FOR IMPROVING STUDENT NETWORKS IN COMPUTER VISION (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/amirmansurian/aicsd?utm_source=tldrai] 

Deep neural networks have excelled in computer vision, but faster
inference times are needed. This paper introduces the Inter-Class
Similarity Distillation method and an Adaptive Loss Weighting strategy
for better knowledge transfer from a teacher network to a student one.


INTEGRATE PRIVATE DATA INTO LLMS WHILE PRESERVING PRIVACY (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/rcgai/simplyretrieve?utm_source=tldrai] 

Generative AI systems have grown with the help of Large Language
Models. The SimplyRetrieve open-source tool offers a user-friendly way
to integrate private data into these systems without extra tuning
using the Retrieval-Centric Generation approach. It promises enhanced
AI performance while ensuring privacy. 

MAGENTIC (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic?utm_source=tldrai] 

Magentic makes it easy to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into
your Python code. Treat prompt templates as functions, using type
annotations to specify structured output. Then, seamlessly mix LLM
queries and function calling with regular Python code to create
complex LLM-powered functionality.

Upload your JSONL data to your drive, link it, and run this notebook
with QLoRA and SFT training to get a custom-tuned Llama2 model. This
seems to be the most minimal example I have found for tuning and works
well. Most importantly, the model uses a (prompt, response) format.
