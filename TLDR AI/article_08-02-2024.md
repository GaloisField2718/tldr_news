HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT BRINGS NEW AI IMAGE FUNCTIONALITY TO COPILOT (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Microsoft announced a major update to its Copilot AI, including a new
design, AI image creation, editing functionalities, and a new AI model
named Deucalion. 

 MEET SMAUG-72B: THE NEW KING OF OPEN-SOURCE AI (4-MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new open-source language model named "Smaug-72B," developed by
Abacus AI and derived from "Qwen-72B" by Alibaba Group's Qwen team,
now leads Hugging Face's natural language processing leaderboard.
Outperforming established models like GPT-3.5 and Mistral Medium in
various benchmarks, Smaug-72B signifies a milestone for open-source AI
by scoring an average of over 80 across major evaluations, hinting at
the potential to rival proprietary AI technologies. 

 EU‚ÄôS AI ACT PASSES LAST BIG HURDLE ON THE WAY TO ADOPTION (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The European Union's AI Act, aimed at regulating artificial
intelligence applications based on risk, has passed a crucial vote by
Member State representatives, who have confirmed the final text of the
draft law.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 HIGH-FIDELITY TEXT-TO-SPEECH MODELS WITH SYNTHETIC ANNOTATIONS (18
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 These text-to-speech models, trained by Stability AI, can be guided
by precise natural language instructions. As there is no large dataset
with proper textual descriptions of audio for generation, its creators
synthetically annotated a large corpus of speech for training. This is
another example of a broader trend of annotation, up-captioning, and
training for generative modeling. 

 MUSICRL (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The MusicLM team at Google used 300k pieces of feedback, along with
other reward signals, to run an RL process on their music generation
models. They found it outperforms the base model in human preference
studies, but it is unclear which RL method yields the highest fidelity
output. 

 ENHANCING CLIP FOR EFFICIENT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION (18 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This paper revisits the classical Gaussian Discriminant Analysis
(GDA) algorithm to improve the performance of CLIP in image
classification tasks without additional training or resources.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 ü§Ø GET 80% AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE IN UNDER 4 MONTHS (SPONSOR) [11]


 QA Wolf [11] gets web apps to 80% automated test coverage in just 4
months. And they guarantee zero flakes. [11]
They build and maintain your automated test suite, plus provide
unlimited parallel test runs. (24-hour maintenance included).

Skeptical? This case study shows how Salesloft¬†saves $750k/year
[12]¬†in QA engineering + executes 300+ tests in parallel on every PR
in minutes.

 YOLO-WORLD: REALTIME OPEN VOCABULARY OBJECT DETECTION (GITHUB REPO)
[14] 

 Object detection is the process of identifying objects and their
bounding boxes. This can usually only be done for a fixed set of
objects chosen before training. This work introduces a real-time
method that can do Open Vocabulary object detection, which means it
can detect bounding boxes for any run-time-specified combination of
objects. 

 SELF DISCOVER IMPLEMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Google proposed a novel prompting technique that allows language
models to use a set of reasoning primitives to discover a larger
framework for problem-specific reasoning. This means the models can
select different modules and combine them to better solve complex
problems. This repository is an unofficial implementation of these
ideas. 

 MOBILEVLM V2 IS OUT! (14 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 MobileVLM V2 is a range of advanced vision-language models for mobile
devices that showcase notable performance improvements through
innovative architecture.

 THE PATH TO PROFITABILITY FOR AI (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Recent shifts in AI research focus on efficiency and depth over mere
accuracy and breadth. NVIDIA's H100 sales and AI's growing energy
demand highlight the industry's scale. Investments demand
profitability, shifting research towards smaller, more efficient
models like Phi 2 and emphasizing sustainable economics from model
architecture to deployment. Innovations in training, fine-tuning, and
design promise to improve AI's energy and computational efficiency.
On-device capabilities reflect a broader trend towards more
sustainable and practical AI applications. 

 CHALLENGING MULTI-MODAL LANGUAGE MODELS WITH A NEW BENCHMARK (16
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A new study reveals a weakness in multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) like GPT-4V: they struggle with specific types of image-text
inputs, leading to errors. CorrelationQA is a benchmark designed to
evaluate MLLMs' performance in scenarios where images may mislead or
contradict text. 

 HOW DESIGN DROVE $10M IN PREORDERS FOR RABBIT R1 AI HARDWARE
(11-MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The Rabbit R1 is a bright orange walkie-talkie for AI. It features
one big button that users push to talk, a chunky scroll wheel to
browse the screen, and a rotating camera with its own privacy door. At
$199, the device can be programmed to control apps and websites. This
article tells the story of how Rabbit and Teenage Engineering
collaborated to create what may be the most successful AI hardware
launch to date.
