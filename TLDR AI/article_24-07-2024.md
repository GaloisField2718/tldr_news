HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LLAMA 3.1 AND 405B MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Meta has released its first open frontier AI model along with
training details. The model is on par with top closed models with a
128k context length, chat models, and a great open system. 

 HARVEY RAISES $100M SERIES C (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The legal startup, now a unicorn, has raised from Google ventures and
others to continue its push into big law firms. 

 OPEN SOURCE IS THE PATH FORWARD (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mark Zuckerberg outlined why open source is key to Meta's strategy
and how Meta plans to support this work.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMPROVED TEST-TIME ADAPTATION (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 STAble Memory rePlay (STAMP) is a method that addresses distribution
shifts between training and test data using only unlabeled test data.
Unlike existing methods, STAMP excels in both recognizing known
classes and rejecting outliers during inference. 

 VIDEO POINT TRACKING (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LocoTrack is an advanced model for tracking any point across video
sequences. It uses local 4D correlation and bidirectional
correspondence for precise tracking. LocoTrack operates nearly six
times faster than current leading models. 

 STAR OPERATION TO TRAIN NEURAL NETWORKS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The star operation is a method that enriches AI models by projecting
data into complex, high-dimensional spaces without the need for bulky
architectures.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 [GITHUB REPO] DATACHAIN: UNSTRUCTURED DATA MANAGEMENT FOR AI
PROJECTS, REIMAGINED (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Iterative's new open-source tool lets you simplify AI projects and
scale unstructured data management. With DataChain, you can source,
curate, and version cloud data at scale [10]; easily integrate
metadata from various formats; parallelize local and API-based AI
model inferences for 3x-10x speedup [10]; and store AI model outputs
as Python data objects. Star the repo [10] 

 LLAMA AGENT STACK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Meta has released an example system for using its Llama models as
agents to perform a variety of tasks. 

 TEXT-DRIVEN STYLIZATION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Artist is a training-free method that controls content and style
generation in pretrained diffusion models for text-driven stylization.


 OPEN-WORLD EXPLORATION IN MINECRAFT (GITHUB REPO) [13]

MISCELLANEOUS

 GUMLOOP SEED ROUND (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Gumloop raised a $3.1M Seed round led by First Round Capital with
participation from YC and co-founders at Instacart, Dropbox, and
Airtable. Gumloop is a no-code AI automation platform that lets any
employee within a business build their own AI tooling and have as much
impact as an engineer. 

 AI DEVELOPMENT KITS: TENSTORRENT UPDATE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Tenstorrent has launched affordable AI development hardware,
including the Wormhole n150 and n300 PCIe cards, priced at $999 and
$1,399, as well as developer workstations, the air-cooled TT-LoudBox
for $12,000 and water-cooled TT-QuietBox for $15,000, both designed to
aid AI development with a focus on connectivity and scaled-out
performance. 

 AI PREDICTS DROUGHTS A YEAR IN ADVANCE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Skoltech and Sber researchers have developed AI models that can
predict droughts several months to a year in advance, improving risk
management for agriculture, insurance, and finance sectors. The
models, tested across various climates, utilize spatiotemporal neural
networks and publicly available data. Russia's largest bank plans to
integrate these findings into its risk assessment systems.
