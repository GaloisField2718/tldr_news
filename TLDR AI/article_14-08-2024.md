 AS ALEXA TURNS 10, AMAZON LOOKS TO GENERATIVE AI (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon's Alexa division incurred a $10 billion loss in 2022 and laid
off staff, highlighting the unsustainability of its loss leader
strategy despite the high household penetration. As enthusiasm for
smart assistants like Siri and Google Assistant also wanes, Amazon is
banking on generative AI to reinvigorate Alexa's capabilities and user
engagement. The company's focus is on enhancing conversational
interactions and overcoming the "smart timer" limitation.

interaction, creating a new category of relationships. Despite
controversies, such as temporary restrictions on adult content, the
app's intent remains to improve users' emotional well-being. With a
user base in the millions and a team of 50-60, Replika is planning a
significant relaunch to enhance interactivity and realism in
conversations.
