HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OUR APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING AI HARMS (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Anthropic unveiled a multidimensional framework to assess and
mitigate AI harms, addressing both catastrophic and everyday risks.
The approach evaluates physical, psychological, economic, societal,
and autonomy impacts, guiding policy, testing, and enforcement
strategies. This initiative, aiming for adaptable, proportionate
safeguards as AI capabilities evolve, complements its Responsible
Scaling Policy. 

 INSTAGRAM AI-BASED TEEN PROTECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta is using AI to identify teens on Instagram and automatically
place them in restricted teen account settings, which now include even
stronger default protections and require parental approval for
changes. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 O3 OVER OPTIMIZATION IS BACK (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post explores the challenge of the new crop of reasoning models
and presents evidence to suggest that OpenAI is over-optimizing on
certain objectives that make its models brittle and prone to
hallucinations. 

 VERIFIABLE REWARDS FOR WRITING (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Writing quality reward models (WQRM) are a way to evaluate the
quality of creative writing. They can be used to train creative
writing models. WQRMs are a new development for RL-trained models with
verifiable rewards. This thread shows a case where WQRM correlated
strongly with overall writing quality. 

 AI ASSISTED SEARCH-BASED RESEARCH ACTUALLY WORKS NOW (6 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Recent advancements in LLMs like OpenAI's o3 and o4-mini have made
them effective for search-based tasks, avoiding past issues with
hallucinations. Unlike earlier models, these LLMs integrate search
results into their reasoning process, providing reliable real-time
insights. This progression diminishes reliance on traditional search
engines and suggests shifts in the Web's economic model.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 🔄 INNER → OUTER DEV LOOP: HOW INDEED IS AUTOMATING ENGINEERING
WORKFLOWS WITH AI (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Happening live this Thursday [10]! Join Erika Rice Scherpelz, VP of
Engineering at Sourcegraph and Kristina Hager, Principal Software
Engineer at Indeed, for a discussion on accelerating developer
iteration (inner loop), automating deployment and delivery (outer
loop), and the role of AI-driven engineering practices throughout the
entire SDLC. Join the conversation [10] 

 FAST CONFORMAL PREDICTION (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 LOO-StabCP boosts the speed of conformal prediction by using
leave-one-out stability, providing scalable uncertainty estimation
without sacrificing accuracy. 

 ROBUST AUTONOMY EMERGES FROM SELF-PLAY (25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This study presents a simulated self driving agent that went 2 years
between collisions. It was trained fully with self-play and is a
substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art trained on Gigaflow.


 ALPHAGEOMETRY 2 (17 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 DeepMind has released the next version of its geometry model, which
answers 84% of questions correctly, up from 54% by prior methods. The
main improvements come from the Gemini language model and better
search.
