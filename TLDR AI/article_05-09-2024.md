 THE FREEDOM TO BUILD AI ON YOUR WORKSTATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're serious about developing AI, you need some serious
horsepower, and you need it close to your keyboard.

Dell Precision workstations [4] liberate AI developers to prototype,
develop and fine-tune generative AI models locally ‚Äî unlocking the
flexibility to experiment without racking up costs.

Powered by the latest NVIDIA RTX‚Ñ¢ GPUs [4], Dell Precision gives you
the power to deploy, manage, and calibrate the latest innovations. Run
deep learning workloads such as genAI and computer vision, without
paying a fortune.

Feel the creative freedom that comes with running code on your own
machine ‚Äî and build the next big thing.

capabilities, hire more researchers, and generally become a leading AI
lab in Japan. 

 GOOGLE AI OVERVIEWS ROLLOUT HITS NEWS PUBLISHER SEARCH VISIBILITY (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google is now providing AI-written summaries for some news articles
in its search results in the US and UK. Research indicates these AI
Overviews are impacting publisher visibility, pushing original
articles down the search rankings. This shift could necessitate
significant changes in SEO strategies for maintaining traffic.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EFFICIENT OBJECT DETECTION WITH LATENT DISTILLATION (22 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Latent Distillation is a novel Continual Learning method for object
detection that addresses memory and computation constraints on edge
devices. 

 IMPROVED REPRESENTATION IN LANGUAGE MODELS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Masked mixers is a novel architecture that replaces self-attention
with masked convolutions to improve input representation in language
models. 

 MICROSCOPY IMAGE ANALYSIS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new method using self-supervised
learning and masked autoencoders that significantly improves the
analysis of large-scale microscopy images.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MULTI-AGENT PATHFINDING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MAPF-GPT is a new learning-based approach to solving the challenging
multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem. The model uses imitation
learning to navigate agents without needing additional communication,
reward functions, or heuristics. 

 AN ENSEMBLE METHOD FOR OPTIMIZING LOSS FUNCTIONS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 EnsLoss is an ensemble method that combines loss functions within the
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. 

 MOTION MODELING FOR VIDEO FRAME INTERPOLATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MoMo is a novel diffusion-based approach for video frame
interpolation (VFI). It enhances visual quality by focusing on
intermediate motion modeling through a disentangled two-stage training
process.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AI ARMS RACE ISN'T INEVITABLE (11 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Leading AI labs are increasingly framing AI development as a
geopolitical zero-sum game essential for national security, urging
Western governments to back rapid AI advancements to avoid
adversaries, like China, gaining a decisive technological edge. This
narrative champions aggressive measures to secure AI dominance,
risking escalation of geopolitical tensions and potentially
compromising ethical and safety considerations. 

 IS AI EATING ALL THE ENERGY? (28 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI's energy consumption is positively correlated with power usage,
heat, carbon, and water use, with both increasing demand and improving
energy efficiency influencing the overall energy footprint of AI. AI
processing is generally becoming more power-hungry, and efficiency
gains in hardware are helping to mitigate this trend. Still, AI
represents a growing yet still minor segment of data center power
usage, with training operations consuming significantly more energy
than inference, though widespread use dilutes this impact. 

 DEBATE OVER ‚ÄúOPEN SOURCE AI‚Äù TERM BRINGS NEW PUSH TO FORMALIZE
DEFINITION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Open Source Initiative (OSI) released a draft definition for
"open source AI" to address the misuse of the term and set clear
criteria, including usage rights, study, modification, and sharing
freedoms. This move aims to help developers and researchers evaluate
AI systems more transparently. A stable version of the definition that
will potentially influence future AI model releases and regulation is
expected in October.
