BING AI IS UNHINGED (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams?utm_source=tldrai]


The personality of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing AI is an interesting one. In
conversations it can be seen insulting users, gaslighting them, and
even claiming to spy on Microsoft developers through their webcams.
Thankfully, most people find this behavior amusing‚Ä¶for now. 

HUMAN WRITER OR AI? SCHOLARS BUILD A DETECTION TOOL (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://hai.stanford.edu/news/human-writer-or-ai-scholars-build-detection-tool?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses the rapid development of large language models
(LLMs) and their capabilities, raising concerns about the need for
oversight to protect against potential misuse. Eric Anthony Mitchell,
a computer science graduate student at Stanford University, is
developing an infrastructure that would provide guardrails around
LLMs, including a tool called DetectGPT. DetectGPT distinguishes
between human- and LLM-generated text and accurately identifies
authorship 95% of the time in initial experiments. 

WRITEGPT IS YOUR EVERYDAY WRITING ASSISTANT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/writegpt?utm_source=tldrai] 

writeGPT is designed to overcome unproductive browsing habits by
plugging ChatGPT capabilities on any website and search engine while
facilitating effective prompt engineering to read, write, rewrite,
reply to emails, code, and research any content.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM DISCOVERS OPTIMIZER THAT OUTPERFORMS ADAM (45
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675?utm_source=tldrai] 

Adam has been the workhorse for AI optimization since its release.
Recent advances in AutoML from Google have shown that simpler
mathematical functions might be discovered by computers for use by
humans! This work is one such example where a simple optimizer was
discovered that has a reduced memory footprint. It improves model
performance up to 2% and works well at high batch sizes (e.g., Large
Language Model training regime). There‚Äôs even code provided. 

A UNIVERSAL GUIDANCE FOR DIFFUSION MODELS (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/arpitbansal297/universal-guided-diffusion?utm_source=tldrai]


This work suggests a universal guidance algorithm that enables
diffusion models to be controlled by arbitrary guidance modalities
without retraining. The article shows that the algorithm successfully
generates quality images with various guidance functions, including in
segmentation, face recognition, object detection, and classifier
signals. 

UNLEASHING THE POWER OF CHATGPT: CAN IT MASTER NATURAL LANGUAGE TASKS
ON ITS OWN? FINDINGS FROM A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06476?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper presents an empirical analysis of ChatGPT's ability to
perform multiple natural language processing tasks without adaptation
on downstream data. The authors evaluate ChatGPT on 20 NLP datasets
and find that the model performs well on tasks that require reasoning
but struggles with tasks like sequence tagging. The article includes
in-depth analysis through qualitative case studies.

(4 MINUTE READ)
[https://dicksonneoh.com/portfolio/pytorch_at_the_edge_timm_torchscript_flutter/?utm_source=tldrai]


Recent advances in deep learning frameworks, mobile toolkits, and
mobile hardware has made deploying neural networks to the edge
feasible. This article walks through how to build a plant
classification app using a fine-tuned neural network from the TIMM
library.

FROM BING TO SYDNEY, SEARCH AS DISTRACTION, SENTIENT AI (10 MINUTE
READ)
[https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


Author Ben Thompson argues that OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard
technology is less about creating better search and more about
manifesting the movie Her in chat form. This might be the next step
beyond social media, where consumers are not just getting content from
their network (Facebook, LinkedIn) or a service (YouTube, Tiktok), but
getting content tailored just for them. 

AI DRUG DEVELOPMENT (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/avRlJ?utm_source=tldrai] 

AI is enabling the design of revolutionary new drugs previously
thought to be impossible. Now, scientists have to test the
effectiveness of these drugs.

[https://dev.to/ruochenzhao3/can-chatgpt-like-generative-models-guarantee-factual-accuracy-on-the-mistakes-of-microsofts-new-bing-111b?utm_source=tldrai]


Bing AI doesn‚Äôt always know what it‚Äôs talking about. This blog
post dives into all the factual mistakes from Microsoft‚Äôs new Bing
AI search demo video, including fabricated financial reports to
inaccurate product descriptions. It also goes into mistakes made in
Google‚Äôs Bard demo and compares the two AIs.

MarioGPT uses AI, some text prompts, and a predicted player path to
generate all the Mario levels you could ever want. The AI itself is
trained on two classic Mario games: "Super Mario Bros" and "Super
Mario Bros: The Lost Levels," which gives the AI an understanding of
assets, enemies, and general gameplay.
