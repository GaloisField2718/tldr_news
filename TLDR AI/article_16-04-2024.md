 HOW AI21, COPY.AI, AND JASPER GOT ENTERPRISE READY (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Most of the successful applications of genAI are currently in B2B.
But to win enterprise-sized contracts, AI startups need to meet
stringent security and compliance requirements.
Against this backdrop, WorkOS has seen tremendous growth [3] with AI
companies using its enterprise-readiness platform. This includes
heavy-hitters like Jasper, Copy.ai, AI21 Labs, and Perplexity.ai.

Check out the WorkOS blog [3] for lessons learned working with these
and other AI startups, including key enterprise-readiness priorities
for AI companies. [3] For more details about Copy.ai's implementation
[4] of SSO, SCIM, and user management, check out the case study [4].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTRODUCING OPENAI JAPAN (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has opened an office in Japan. ChatGPT Enterprise is being
adopted in Japan by businesses such as Daikin, Rakuten, and TOYOTA
Connected. The Japanese government, focusing on AI policies for
societal benefit, has collaborated to share ChatGPT best practices. 

 ADOBE'S WORKING ON GENERATIVE VIDEO (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adobe is developing an AI model to generate video, which will be
integrated into Premiere Pro later this year. It will feature object
addition, removal, and generative extend capabilities. Adobe is
collaborating with third-party vendors and addressing deepfake
concerns through Content Credentials. 

 OPENAI AND META REPORTEDLY PREPARING NEW AI MODELS CAPABLE OF
REASONING (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI and Meta are teasing the next iterations of their AI models,
expected to feature enhanced reasoning and planning capabilities.
Dubbed GPT-5 and Llama 3, the models aim to advance toward artificial
general intelligence, with vague release timelines and application
details. The tech community remains skeptical given the history of
overhyped AI promises with limited substantive evidence.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PILE-T5 (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 T5 is a workhorse of modern AI. Eleuther has retrained it with a
modern tokenizer and for much longer. The result is a greatly improved
base model for encoding tasks. 

 DEEP DIVE: VIDEO DIFFUSION MODELS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post explores how to train diffusion models to generate video,
how to adapt image models, and even how to generate video from an
image model without additional training.

 3D HUMAN MOTION CAPTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Addressing the challenges in monocular egocentric 3D human motion
capture, especially under difficult lighting and fast movements,
researchers introduce a novel method using a fisheye event camera. 

 ZERO-SHOT DIALOGUE STATE TRACKING IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Researchers have developed a new approach called Mixture of Prefix
Prompt Experts (MPPE) to enhance zero-shot dialogue state tracking,
which transfers knowledge to unseen domains without needing new
dataset annotations. 

 3D UNDERSTANDING WITH ANY2POINT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Any2Point is a new method that efficiently translates capabilities
from vision, language, and audio models into the 3D domain without
losing spatial geometries.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE AGONY AND ECSTASY OF REVIEWING HUMANE'S AI PIN (23 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Humane's Ai Pin, an AI-powered wearable, has many technical issues,
from music streaming to AI assistant malfunctions. Despite its
ambition to create an ambient computing experience, the
first-generation device suffers from performance lags and a lack of
essential features, though future software updates are promised. The
Ai Pin is designed with attention to detail but struggles to replace
traditional smartphones, positioning itself as a companion device for
a more present and less screen-focused lifestyle. 

 YOU CAN'T BUILD A MOAT WITH AI (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI differentiation is challenging, but the key lies not in AI models
like LLMs, which are becoming commoditized, but in the unique data fed
into these models. Effective data engineering is crucial as it
directly impacts AI performance, with applications requiring
integration of customer-specific data to provide accurate responses.
Thus, creating a competitive edge in AI applications hinges on
innovative data use rather than the AI technology itself.
