 UNLEASH ANTHROPIC'S MOST POWERFUL MODELS ON YOUR ENTIRE CODEBASE WITH
CLAUDE CODE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Working with coding agents gets frustrating: constant
command-tabbing, manually copying files, writing convoluted prompts to
explain dependencies…there has to be a better way.

There is. Claude Code automatically maps and understands your entire
project structure [4] without manual context selection. And by knowing
your codebase, it aces complex tasks where other agents stutter:

✅ Multi-file edits that actually compile.

✅ GitHub issues become PRs while you grab coffee.

✅ Deep codebase refactors that would take hours, done in minutes.

Best part? Claude Code runs directly in your terminal [4]. Multiply
your productivity without changing your workflow.

 WHY CHINA ISN'T ABOUT TO LEAP AHEAD OF THE WEST ON COMPUTE (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Chinese hardware has closed the computational performance gap from
10x to just 3x behind NVIDIA's latest chips, yet over 90% of notable
Chinese language models since 2017 were still trained on Western
hardware. Major bottlenecks in chip manufacturing yields—SMIC
achieves below 50% compared to TSMC's 90%—and immature software
ecosystems mean Chinese developers continue preferring NVIDIA when
available. 

 CLAUDE CODE IN PRACTICE: ANTHROPIC CASE STUDY (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This case study explores how Anthropic's internal teams, from legal
to engineering, are using Claude Code to automate tasks, bridge skill
gaps, and accelerate complex projects.

 QWEN3 235B THINKING (HUGGING FACE REPO) [12] 

 Alibaba's latest open-source thinking model achieves 92.3% on AIME25
math competitions, matching OpenAI's O4-mini performance while
surpassing it on coding benchmarks with 74.1% on LiveCodeBench. The
235B parameter mixture-of-experts model activates only 22B parameters
during inference, making it more efficient than traditional dense
models. 

 COLLABLLM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 CollabLLM is an open-source framework that trains language models to
ask strategic questions and guide conversations rather than make
assumptions, using "Multiturn-aware Reward" that evaluates responses
based on their long-term impact on conversation outcomes rather than
immediate helpfulness. 

 AGENTICSEEK (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A fully local, voice-enabled AI assistant that autonomously browses
the web, writes code, and plans tasks. It was designed to be a private
open-source alternative to Manus AI with no cloud dependencies.
