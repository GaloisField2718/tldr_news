 YOUR AI ISN'T BUILT FOR MARKETING AND DIGITAL TEAMS. OPAL IS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 HEADS UP: If your go-to AI tool isn't purpose-built, you're bringing
a spork to a swordfight. 

Optimizely Opal [5] is the AGENT ORCHESTRATION PLATFORM built
specifically for marketing and digital teams – designed around REAL
MARKETING PAIN POINTS (*_cough_* lack of time _cough_), repetitive
workflows, and the “I didn't sign up for this” tasks that kill
momentum and creativity.

Opal turns marketing ideals into ALWAYS-ON AGENTS THAT DO THE WORK FOR
YOU [6]. Not another generic AI tool, but an AI system expressly
designed for marketing teams.

 CLAUDE 4.5 OPUS' SOUL DOCUMENT (84 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There appears to be a document in the character training for Claude
compressed within Claude's weights. While it is possible for the model
to hallucinate the text, it appears to be real. This post details how
the document was extracted. The full output of Claude's Soul Document
is available in the post. 

 OPENAI MAY DEPLOY ADS SOON (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A recent update to the ChatGPT Android app included references to an
“ads feature” with “search ads” and “bazaar content”. 

 DATABRICKS REPORTEDLY IN TALKS TO RAISE $5B AT $134B VALUATION (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Databricks is reportedly in talks to raise $5 billion at a $134
billion valuation. The company has resisted pressure to go public, but
an IPO would likely be well-received. Databricks has more than 20,000
customers, including OpenAI, Block, Shell, and Toyota. Its platform
offers tools that support the full lifecycle of AI development,
including feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and
deployment.

 HOW PROMPT CACHING WORKS (32 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prompt caching works per-content, not per-conversation. Prefix
caching works at the token level, not the request level, which is why
it works across requests. Any change in the prefix breaks the entire
hash chain. 

 ARE WE IN A GPT-4-STYLE LEAP THAT EVALS CAN'T SEE? (9 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Chat is a terrible way to evaluate models. GPT-4 was so significantly
better at answering questions that it was an obvious step forward. The
industry needs to add more types of benchmarking. Models are currently
being evaluated like students in an exam, but that's not
representative of how the world works.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 FORGET THE MYTHICAL 10X DEVELOPERS - FOCUS ON BUILDING 10X TEAMS
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 The 10x developer is a unicorn. But the 10x team? That's achievable
— when AI gives everyone the same context. Sentry CEO's latest post
[12] breaks down how AI agents are changing debugging from "here's
what broke" to "here's why, explained in plain English." Shared
reasoning means shorter feedback loops and compounding learning across
the whole team. Read the blog [12] 

 WHAT MAKES A GREAT CHATGPT APP (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The biggest mistake developers make is trying to port entire products
into ChatGPT when they should instead expose a few powerful
capabilities the model can orchestrate mid-conversation. Devs should
organize around giving ChatGPT new data it can't access ("know"),
enable real actions like booking appointments or playing games ("do"),
and present information through richer UI than text walls ("show"). 

 CONTEXT PLUMBING (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Context is always changing, as it is dynamic. The context is not
always where the AI runs. To make an agent run really well, you need
to move the context to where it needs to be. Agents shouldn't have to
look up context for every single query, because that's slow. Engineers
need to build pipes that continuously flow potential context from
where it is created to where it is going to be used. 

 EMBODIED COGNITION BENCHMARKING (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ENACT is a benchmark for evaluating embodied cognition using
egocentric world modeling.

 IT'S HARD TO FEEL THE AGI (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Some of the most accomplished minds in AI are beginning to revise
their projections for the near future. This may not be entirely
unexpected for those who follow the field. LLMs and other generative
models have undoubtedly made many tangible achievements. Discovering
their limits remains a challenging task that could be lost if industry
climate drops to a new 'AI winter'. 

 VIBE PROVING IS HERE (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 An AI model just proved Erdos Problem #124 in Lean by itself. The
problem has been open for nearly 30 years. The achievement shows how
mathematical superintelligence is getting closer. The technology will
change and dramatically accelerate progress in mathematics and all
dependent fields.
