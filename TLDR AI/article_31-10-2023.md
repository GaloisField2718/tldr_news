 GPT-3.5-TURBO IS 20B PARAMETER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers wrote that gpt-3.5-turbo (the model behind ChatGPT) is a
20B parameter model in a paper by a Microsoft research group that
studies diffusion models for code. The original model was said to be
175B parameters, so there could have been retraining or distillation. 

 ANNOUNCING THE OPEN EMPATHIC PROJECT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The group behind Stable Diffusion has launched the Open Empathic

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 USING EMBEDDINGS IN COMPUTER VISION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Embeddings are machine-readable lists of numbers that represent some
information about a piece of data. They are increasingly obtained by
running the data through a neural network and looking at the
activations of the model. This post pushes that idea forward with CLIP
on a computer vision task and explores how to use dimensionality
reduction to reason about the learned embeddings. 

 REPRODUCING OPENAI'S FIRST RLHF REPOSITORY (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The HuggingFace team reproduces a 2019 repository from OpenAI that
introduced some of the first RLHF ideas.

 PERSONALIZED IMAGE CLUSTERING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This paper introduces Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria
(IC‚Å†TC), a method that leverages vision-language models to sort
images based on user-given text descriptions. 

 AZURE OPENAI LOGGER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project aims to create a simple and easy to deploy solution to
add observability to your Azure OpenAI instance. The approach adds an
API Management instance as a proxy for your existing Azure OpenAI
service, and funnels logs/requests/responses to an Application
Insights instance. It also saves a prebuilt query to a workbook for
easy access to logs.
