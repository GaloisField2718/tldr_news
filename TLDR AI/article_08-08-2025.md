HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI GPT-5 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-5, its most advanced AI model yet, now
available to all ChatGPT users. 

 CURSOR RELEASES TERMINAL CODING AGENT IN EARLY BETA (1 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Similar to Claude Code and Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI brings AI coding
assistance directly to the terminal and allows developers to switch
seamlessly between command-line and editor-based AI workflows. 

 X TO INTRODUCE ADS IN GROK RESPONSES (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elon Musk announced that X will begin inserting ads into Grok's AI
responses, aiming to boost the platform's ad revenue using xAI's
targeting tech and chatbot suggestions.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 VIBE CHECK ON GPT-5 (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GPT-5 excels as a daily driver for most users, with API pricing that
aggressively undercuts competitors by up to 12x. However, it is too
cautious for writing feedback or for autonomous coding workflows,
making it feel like a significant upgrade to an old paradigm rather
than a leap forward for developers already using multi-agent tools
like Claude Code. 

 GPT-5 HANDS-ON: WELCOME TO THE STONE AGE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GPT-5 marks the "stone age" for AI. It doesn't just use tools - it
thinks with them, like humans first learning to shape stones changed
everything. Testing showed it one-shotted dependency conflicts that
stumped every other model by using yarn commands like Deep Research
uses web search, iterating and reasoning through problems instead of
just guessing. While it's worse at writing than GPT-4.5 (producing
more "LinkedIn slop"), it's unequivocally the best coding model -
creating entire production-ready websites with SQLite databases in one
shot, where other models gave scaffolding or plans, automating
software engineering from maybe 65% to 72% in one leap. 

 METR'S EVALUATION OF GPT-5 (44 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 METR assessed whether OpenAI GPT-5 could pose catastrophic risks
before it was externally deployed. This post provides detailed
findings from METR's assessment. METR determined that GPT-5 does not
have the prerequisite capabilities - by a large margin - to pose
catastrophic risk.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 MOMENTIC: AI THAT MAKES TESTING EFFORTLESS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 YC-backed Momentic uses AI to automate web app testing. Write tests
in Plain English ("the login button should be visible") and let AI
execute the test. Join hyper-growth companies like Retool, Notion,
Webflow, and 100s of others using Momentic. See how it works [12] 

 NOTTE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Notte is a web agent framework built for speed, cost-efficiency,
scale, and reliability. It allows developers to rapidly build reliable
web automation agents. Notte provides all the essential tools for
building and deploying AI agents that interact seamlessly with the
web. The full-stack framework combines AI agents with traditional
scripting for maximum efficiency. It enables users to develop, deploy,
and scale their own agents and web automations within a single API. 

 OCTO (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Octo is a very friendly open-source coding helper. It works with any
OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible LLM API. Octo allows developers to
switch models at will mid-conversation when a particular model gets
stuck. Users have the option to use custom-trained models to
automatically handle tool call and code edit features from the main
models. Octo has zero telemetry. 

 ACHIEVING 10,000X TRAINING DATA REDUCTION WITH HIGH-FIDELITY LABELS
(11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Identifying policy-violating content requires solutions capable of
deep contextual and cultural understanding, an area that large
language models (LLMs) excel at over traditional machine learning
systems. However, fine-tuning models for such complex tasks requires
high-fidelity training data that is difficult and expensive to curate
at the necessary quality and scale. This post describes a scalable
curation process for active learning that drastically reduces the
amount of training data needed for fine-tuning LLMs while
significantly improving model alignment with human experts. In
experiments, the process reduced the scale of training data needed
from 100,000 to under 500 training examples while increasing model
alignment with human experts by up to 65%. 

 FROM HARD REFUSALS TO SAFE-COMPLETIONS: TOWARD OUTPUT-CENTRIC SAFETY
TRAINING (23 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The technique uses two reward parameters during training: safety
constraints that penalize policy violations by severity, and
helpfulness maximization that rewards both direct compliance and
informative refusals with safe alternatives. In tests, GPT-5 with
safe-completions achieved higher safety scores than o3 on dual-use
prompts while providing substantially more helpful responses, and when
failures did occur, they were significantly less severe.

 OPENAI'S O3 CRUSHES GROK 4 IN FINAL, WINS KAGGLE'S AI CHESS
EXHIBITION TOURNAMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI's o3 beat Grok 4 in the Kaggle Arena AI Chess Exhibition
Tournament. Gemini 2.5 Pro defeated o4-mini 3.5-0.5 for the bronze
medal. Grok appears to struggle with end games. o3 could understand
the endgame much better and came up with better moves, eventually
checkmating Grok. 

 STABILITY AI LAUNCHES ENTERPRISE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Stability AI introduced a new enterprise offering that delivers
tailored generative AI models and workflows for creative production.

 Anthropic credits its commitment to safety, the quality of its
research, and its team of top researchers as reasons that talent
chooses to go there. 

 WHY YOUR AI NEVER WORKS ON THE FIRST TRY (14 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI isn't thinking and then outputting a solution - every token a
large language model generates is selected from adjacent possibilities
in probability space. 

 ANTHROPIC TO OPEN TOKYO OFFICE (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Anthropic named Hidetoshi Tojo as Head of Japan and plans to open a
Tokyo office, expanding its presence in Asia.
