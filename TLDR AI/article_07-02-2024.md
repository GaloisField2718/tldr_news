HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI IS ADDING NEW WATERMARKS TO DALL-E 3 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is implementing watermarks in images generated by DALL-E 3,
following standards from the Coalition for Content Provenance and
Authenticity (C2PA), to include invisible metadata and a visible CR
symbol for provenance verification. 

 MICROSOFT COPILOT FOR SALES AND COPILOT FOR SERVICE ARE NOW GENERALLY
AVAILABLE (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft's AI-driven Copilot for Sales and Service is now generally
available. It integrates with CRM systems like Salesforce to enhance
productivity for sales and service professionals. The tools automate
repetitive tasks and provide insights directly within Microsoft 365
apps, aiming to improve customer interactions and streamline business
workflows. Early adopters like Avanade report significant time savings
and better customer engagement using these AI capabilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CLIP TRAINED ON FULLY SYNTHETIC DATA (28 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The removal of large-scale datasets such as LAION, along with valid
copyright concerns, makes training large-scale image models
challenging. This work shows that you can train a powerful CLIP model
with 30 million synthetically generated images. 

 TINY LANGUAGE MODELS FOR MOBILE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This research explores how to make powerful language models more
suitable for mobile devices by focusing on tiny models with fewer
parameters. 

 NEW TOOLS TO TACKLE HALLUCINATIONS IN MULTIMODAL LLMS (16 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Addressing the critical issue of hallucinations in Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), researchers have developed MHaluBench, a new
benchmark for evaluating hallucination detection methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 STATE OF THE ART BACKGROUND REMOVAL (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Bria AI has open sourced (non-commercial) its background removal
model and tools, including training data mixture and performance
metrics. It is a significant improvement over alternative open models.


 CREATE YOUR OWN VIDEO WITH INTERACTIVEVIDEO (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 InteractiveVideo introduces a novel way of making videos where users
can dynamically interact with the creation process. Unlike traditional
methods, this user-friendly framework allows for real-time
modifications using text, images, painting, and even drag-and-drop. 

 MATHEMATICAL REASONING IN AI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 DeepSeekMath 7B is a language model specifically designed to tackle
complex mathematical problems. It's been trained on a massive amount
of math-focused content.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN SOURCE 1.3B TEXT TO SPEECH MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The new Meta Voice model is a small and powerful text-to-speech model
that supports generation and voice cloning. 

 AGI TRADES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Advanced AIs like GPT-5 could have significant impacts across
markets, real estate, labor, energy, national economies, geopolitics,
and the economy's inflationary dynamics, leading to a reevaluation of
value accrual, global power shifts, and changes in employment and
economic structures. 

 THE TECHNO-INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 As AI tooling and business use cases become more sophisticated,
we‚Äôll start to see more and more real-world applications of the
tech. One lens to look at the opportunity here is how AI will make
processes cheaper and more efficient whilst growing margins
substantially. This might unlock a whole new way of doing things that
previously didn‚Äôt make economic sense because margins were too thin.
This article explores a few of these examples.
