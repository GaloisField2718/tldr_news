 MOVING FROM THE CLOUD TO LOCAL DESKSIDE AI DEVELOPMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Think you need expensive cloud GPUs to develop AI? You might be
mistaken. Join NVIDIA and Dell Technologies for a live webinar [4] on
moving from cloud AI development to a local Precision workstation.

By the end of the session, you will better understand how Dell
Precision workstations, powered by NVIDIA RTX(TM) GPUs, are
revolutionizing local AI development [4] - from data prep to training
and customizing models to deployment.

If you're interested in accelerating AI development and removing
infrastructure roadblocks, this is a must attend. Save your spot for
the live session (December 12) [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AI2'S OPENSCHOLAR (10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ai2 has unveiled OpenScholar, a retrieval-augmented language model
that searches for relevant papers and generates answers grounded in
those sources. It will make it easier for scientists to find and
synthesize knowledge. 

 ANTHROPIC X AWS TRAINIUM COLLABORATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic is partnering with AWS to improve the quality of trainium
inference and tooling as part of a recent investment. 

 WILL SAM ALTMAN ALWAYS WIN THE OPENAI BOARD FIGHT IN AN AI AGENT
SIMULATION? (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fable, a game and AI simulation company, built a simulation to
explore the OpenAI board dispute involving Sam Altman using an AI
decision-making framework called SIM-1. The simulation, which
leveraged multi-agent competition and GPT4o, highlighted the
unlikelihood of Altman's return as CEO in only 4 out of 20 scenarios.
The research underscores AI's potential in simulating complex
decision-making environments.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FIXING HUMAN ARTIFACTS IN AI-GENERATED IMAGES (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This study tackles the challenge of distorted human figures in
text-to-image models by introducing the Human Artifact Dataset (HAD),
a large-scale dataset with over 37,000 annotated images. 

 BOOSTING LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGES IN LLMS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 UnifiedCrawl offers a new way to collect large-scale text data for
low-resource languages from Common Crawl using minimal computing
power. 

 A NEW IMAGE-TO-VIDEO MODEL (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed image-to-video diffusion models that
generate realistic motion transformations from static images,
addressing limitations in traditional methods like affine
transformations.

 AIMV2: NEW VISION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The AIMv2 family of vision models leverages a multimodal
autoregressive training approach that shows impressive performance
across tasks. 

 A NEW ATTENTION MECHANISM FOR TRAINING LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 AnchorAttention is a new attention mechanism designed to enhance the
training of Large Language Models in long-context scenarios. It
resolves numerical challenges associated with Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) when using BFloat16 precision. 

 COMBINING CONVOLUTIONS AND SELF-ATTENTIONS FOR EFFICIENT VISION
MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 GLMix is a new method for integrating convolutions and multi-head
self-attentions (MHSAs) at different granularity levels in vision
tasks. Convolutions handle fine-grained local features, while MHSAs
operate on coarse-grained semantic slots for global insights.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ECHO MIMIC V2 (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Open weights system to animate partial human bodies with a reference
image and audio input. It uses pose specific VAEs to combine the
information from various channels and a reference image to animate. 

 GWERN BRANWEN - HOW AN ANONYMOUS RESEARCHER PREDICTED AI'S TRAJECTORY
(82 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In this post, Gwern Branwen, an early observer of LLM scaling,
discusses AI progress and influences on the development of AGI,
emphasizing the importance of scaling and compute over traditional
algorithmic breakthroughs. He reflects on the potential role of human
intelligence versus AI and the implications of forthcoming
technological advances like weight-loss drugs on human behavior.
Branwen also shares insights on his writing process and the broader
impacts of AI on creative work. 

 THE BITTER RELIGION: AI'S HOLY WAR OVER SCALING LAWS (17 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The AI community is divided over "The Bitter Religion" and its focus
on scaling computation as the primary driver of AI performance. Some,
including OpenAI leaders, believe AGI can be achieved soon through
continued scaling, while others argue that alternative scientific
advancements are needed. The debate impacts investment and development
strategies across AI and adjacent fields, as scaling laws may not be
sustainable long-term.

watched. 

 DOCUMIND (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Documind utilizes AI to extract structured data from PDFs by
converting them into images and leveraging OpenAI's API. 

 WHY LLMS WITHIN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT MAY BE A DEAD END (8 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 LLMs in software development face challenges due to their lack of
decomposability and explainability.
