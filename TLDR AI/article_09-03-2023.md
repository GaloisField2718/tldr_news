SALESFORCE ANNOUNCES EINSTEIN GPT, THE WORLD‚ÄôS FIRST GENERATIVE AI
FOR CRM (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Salesforce-Announces-Einstein-GPT-the-Worlds-First-Generative-AI-for-CRM/default.aspx?utm_source=tldrai]


Salesforce launched Einstein GPT, the world‚Äôs first generative AI
CRM technology, which delivers AI-created content across every sales,
service, marketing, commerce, and IT interaction. In partnership with
OpenAI, Einstein GPT will infuse Salesforce‚Äôs proprietary AI models
with generative AI technology from an ecosystem of partners and
real-time data from the Salesforce Data Cloud, which ingests,
harmonizes, and unifies all of a company‚Äôs customer data.
Additionally, the new ChatGPT app for Slack integrates OpenAI‚Äôs
advanced AI technology to deliver instant conversation summaries,
research tools, and writing assistance. 

RUN STABLE DIFFUSION IN THE BROWSER WITH WEBGPU (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://mlc.ai/web-stable-diffusion/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This project brings stable diffusion models to web browsers.
Everything runs inside the browser with no need of server support.
This is the first example of the pre-trained model running on a
client‚Äôs GPU from the browser. It still has some rough edges and
sometimes results in browser crashing, but it is an exciting step
towards a more modular future. 

HOW GOOGLE BECAME CAUTIOUS OF AI AND GAVE MICROSOFT AN OPENING (8
MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/bNxEQ?utm_source=tldrai] 

More than two years ago, a pair of Google researchers started pushing
the company to release a powerful chatbot. The conversational AI they
had developed could confidently debate philosophy and banter about its
favorite TV shows, while improvising puns about cows and horses. The
researchers told colleagues that chatbots like theirs, supercharged by
recent advances in AI, would revolutionize the way people searched the
internet and interacted with computers, according to people who heard
the remarks. They pushed Google to give access to the chatbot to
outside researchers, tried to get it integrated into the Google
Assistant virtual helper and later asked for Google to make a public
demo available. Google executives rebuffed them at multiple turns.

LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS DO IN-CONTEXT LEARNING DIFFERENTLY (60 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03846?utm_source=tldrai] 

As model size increases large language models seem to exhibit some
amazing emergent behavior. This paper explores the phenomenon of
‚Äúin-context learning‚Äù. They find that smaller models rely on their
semantic priors and ignore examples that are wrong while larger models
learn from the new examples. 

VISUAL CHATGPT: TALKING, DRAWING AND EDITING WITH VISUAL FOUNDATION
MODELS (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04671?utm_source=tldrai] 

Researchers from Microsoft introduce Visual ChatGPT, a system that
combines ChatGPT language model with different visual models, enabling
users to interact with ChatGPT using both language and images. The
system allows users to provide feedback and ask for corrected results.
It injects visual model information into ChatGPT and considers models
with multiple inputs/outputs and those that require visual feedback.

DATASET FOR INSTRUCTION TUNING (HUGGINGFACE DATASET)
[https://huggingface.co/datasets/yizhongw/self_instruct?utm_source=tldrai]


Much of the improvements in language models has come from tuning them
on instructions. These datasets have a specific format and are
somewhat expensive to collect and curate. The authors of self-instruct
have released their dataset which contains 50k+ instructions. 

X-AVATAR: EXPRESSIVE HUMAN AVATARS (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://skype-line.github.io/projects/X-Avatar/?utm_source=tldrai] 

X-Avatar is a new avatar model that captures the full expressiveness
of digital humans. It can be learned from 3D scans or RGB-D data and
models bodies, hands, facial expressions, and appearance holistically.
The method uses a learned forward skinning module and novel sampling
strategies. The paper also contributes a new dataset called X-Humans.
The proposed method outperforms strong baselines on the animation
task. 

VISUAL PERCEPTION WITH PRE-TRAINED DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/wl-zhao/VPD?utm_source=tldrai] 

VPD (Visual Perception with Pre-trained Diffusion Models) is a
framework that leverages the high-level and low-level knowledge of a
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to downstream visual
perception tasks.

DIFFUSION MODELS FOR ROBOTICS (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/?utm_source=tldrai] 

If you diffuse a motion path, robotic control becomes significantly
more effective! The diffusion process improves the ability of robot
manipulators to accomplish challenging tasks. 

EMERGENT ABILITIES OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/?utm_source=tldrai]


Language models (LMs) are a class of probabilistic models that learn
patterns in natural language. LMs can be utilized for generative
purposes to generate, say, the next event in a story by exploiting
their knowledge of these patterns. In recent years, significant
efforts have been put into scaling LMs into Large Language Models
(LLMs). As LLMs are scaled they hit a series of critical scales at
which new abilities are suddenly ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù. LLMs are not directly
trained to have these abilities. These emergent abilities include
performing arithmetic, answering questions, summarizing passages, and
more.
