 HOW TO MAXIMIZE GENAI CONTEXT AND ACCURACY WITH GRAPHS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 It seems like everyone is jumping into GenAI. But when training your
LLM, how do you build for accurate, up-to-date responses ‚ùìü§î

Here are 3 guides to get you on track to deliver reliable,
context-driven models:

Guide #1 üèóÔ∏è Construct a knowledge graph [4] using unstructured
text

Guide #2 üí¨ Implement a RAG application [5] to generate accurate,
up-to-date answers

Guide #3 üß† Pick from four RAG strategies to enhance and alter
output [6]

What are you waiting for? GenAI is moving quickly...and so should you!

 FISHING FOR MAGIKARP: AUTOMATICALLY DETECTING UNDER-TRAINED TOKENS IN
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Language models rely on separately trained tokenizers. These may
produce tokens that are never seen during language model training.
There are many in even the most powerful modern language models. This
paper explores this phenomenon and presents their findings for
identifying and dealing with these tokens. 

 THUNDERKITTENS CUDA DSL (7 MINUTE READ) [12]

co-intelligence, augmenting human efforts rather than replacing them. 

 ASTERISK/ZVI ON CALIFORNIA'S AI BILL (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 California's SB1047 bill proposes regulations for AI models with
computational capacities over 10^26 FLOPs. It focuses on ensuring
these models are used safely by requiring secure environments, quick
deactivation capabilities, and rigorous misuse potential testing. The
bill targets only high-risk scenarios, aiming to balance innovation
with safeguards against misuse in response to concerns about AI's
potential impact on society.
