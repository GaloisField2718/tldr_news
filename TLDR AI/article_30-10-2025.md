 AUTH0 FOR AI AGENTS: THE SECURE WAY TO AUTHENTICATE AND RIGHTSIZE
AGENT PERMISSIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your agent needs to call APIs, read documents, and make decisions.
But without proper controls, it can access data it shouldn't, call
services without approval, or leak sensitive information.

Auth0 for AI Agents [4] adds a control layer to your AI deployment.
Authenticate users and agents, let agents call APIs securely through a
Token Vault, add human approval at critical moments, and control
document access through FGA for RAG.

✅ Setup takes 5 minutes

✅ Supports any language or framework.

Auth0 for AI Agents is currently in Developer Preview (GA this
October). Get early access ↗️ [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CURSOR DEBUTS COMPOSER AND MULTI-AGENT SUITE IN CURSOR 2.0 (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cursor 2.0 features Cursor's first coding model, Composer, and a
multi-agent interface. Composer can complete most tasks in under 30
seconds. Its training allows it to accurately navigate and understand
large and complex codebases. Cursor 2.0's new interface allows
multiple agents to operate in parallel, managed via git worktrees or
remote machines. The new release is aimed at addressing workflow
challenges seen in modern development teams. 

 NVIDIA BECOMES FIRST COMPANY TO HIT $5 TRILLION VALUATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Nvidia's 2025 revenue more than doubled to $130.5 billion, up 114%
year-over-year. Jensen Huang announced $500 billion in AI chip orders
and plans to build seven government supercomputers. President Trump is
expected to discuss Nvidia's chips with Xi Jinping as the high-end
processors remain a key sticking point in US-China trade tensions due
to Washington's export controls.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY FOUNDATION MODELS IN PATHOLOGY ARE FAILING (AND WHAT COMES NEXT)
(12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Optimization for the wrong target produces excellent results at that
target while failing at the actual problem. Pathology needs
optimization for clinical utility, generalization across institutions,
and robustness to real-world conditions. The next generation of
pathology AI will be smarter about what size and architectural
approach actually fit the problem. It will be smaller, more
interpretable, more rigorously validated, and more aware of its own
limitations. 

 SIGNS OF INTROSPECTION IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Anthropic researchers used concept injection, artificially inserting
neural activity patterns into Claude's processing, to test whether
models could identify the change to their own thinking. Claude Opus
correctly recognized injected concepts about 20% of the time,
sometimes noticing that something was “off” before mentioning the
inserted concept.

 INTRODUCING GPT-OSS-SAFEGUARD (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The gpt-oss-safeguard models (120b and 20b parameters) let developers
apply custom safety policies at inference time rather than training
their own classifiers on thousands of labeled examples, using
chain-of-thought reasoning to explain decisions. 

 CLAUDE SKILLS, ANYWHERE: MAKING THEM FIRST-CLASS IN CODEX CLI (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post discusses how to make Claude Skills available globally. The
trick is to treat the skills and an enumerator as global assets. Put
the skills in Codex's installation folder and drop a script that
enumerates skills into the PATH. This allows Codex to discover skills
in any repository by running that script as instructed in AGENTS.md. 

 INTRODUCING SWE-1.5: OUR FAST AGENT MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SWE-1.5 is a frontier-sized model with hundreds of billions of
parameters optimized for software engineering. It achieves near
state-of-the-art coding performance and sets a new standard for speed.
The model is now available in Windsurf, serving at up to 950 tokens
per second. It can be used to deeply explore and understand large
codebases, build end-to-end full-stack apps, and easily edit
configurations without needing to memorize field names.

 AGENT LABS ARE EATING THE SOFTWARE WORLD (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Agent labs ship product first and build infrastructure later. They
turn AI models into goal-directed systems that deliver outcomes,
capturing the real value in the AI stack. Founders only need a deep
understanding of a domain and the ability to build reliable workflows
on top of existing models. The most valuable developer skills are
shifting from model architecture to system design, evaluation
engineering, and domain-specific workflow optimization. Investors
should look for companies that capture workflow data and have clear
evaluation metrics. The moat is in the data and feedback loops, not
the models. 

 HOW AI LABS USE MERCOR TO GET THE DATA COMPANIES WON'T SHARE (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Mercor's marketplace connects former employees of investment banks,
consulting houses, and law firms with the AI labs looking to automate
those industries. Its customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.
The startup pays industry experts up to $200 an hour to fill out forms
and write reports for AI training. It has tens of thousands of
contractors that it pays more than $1.5 million to daily. Mercor's
annual recurring revenue has grown to roughly $500 million in just
under three years.
