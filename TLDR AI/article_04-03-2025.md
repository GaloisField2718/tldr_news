 THE BATTLE AGAINST BOTS: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR AI APP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Modern bots are smarter than ever [5]—executing JavaScript, storing
cookies, rotating IPs, and even cracking CAPTCHAs with AI. As attacks
grow more sophisticated, traditional detection just isn't enough.

Enter WORKOS RADAR [6]—your all-in-one bot defense solution. With
just a single API, you can instantly secure your signup flow against
brute force attacks, leaked credentials, and disposable emails. Stop
bots in their tracks and keep your real users safe.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC RAISES SERIES E AT $61.5B POST-MONEY VALUATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Anthropic raised $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation led by
Lightspeed Venture Partners and others. The funds will advance AI
development, expand compute capacity, and accelerate international
growth. Its Claude platform is transforming operations for companies
like Zoom, Pfizer, and Replit. 

 T-MOBILE'S PARENT COMPANY IS MAKING AN ‘AI PHONE' WITH PERPLEXITY
ASSISTANT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Deutsche Telekom announced its upcoming Perplexity chatbot-powered AI
Phone, set to launch later this year. The device will utilize Magenta
AI, offering users tools like Perplexity Assistant, Google Cloud AI,
and others. Some AI features will also be integrated into the existing
MeinMagenta app for other smartphones. 

 ON-DEVICE GENERATIVE AUDIO WITH STABILITY AI & ARM (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Stability AI and Arm bring real-time generative audio to smartphones
using Stable Audio Open and Arm KleidiAI libraries, achieving a 30x
speedup in audio generation on mobile devices.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 HOW FAR CAN WE GO WITH IMAGENET FOR TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION? (30
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Most text-to-image models use a substantial amount of
custom-collected data scraped from the web. This work asks how good of
an image generation model can be trained just on ImageNet. The
researchers found that synthetically generated dense captions gave the
best performance boost. 

 UNITOK: A UNIFIED TOKENIZER FOR VISUAL GENERATION AND UNDERSTANDING
(27 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This paper addresses the representational gap between visual
generation and understanding by proposing UniTok, a discrete visual
tokenizer that simultaneously encodes detailed information for
generation and semantic content for understanding to overcome capacity
bottlenecks inherent to discrete tokens. It introduces multi-codebook
quantization, which significantly enhances token expressiveness and
enables UniTok to achieve performance superior to or competitive with
domain-specific continuous tokenizers. 

 DYNAMIC SPARSE ATTENTION FOR LLMS (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 FlexPrefill dynamically adjusts sparse attention patterns and
computational budgets for efficient LLM inference. It improves speed
and accuracy in long-sequence processing by leveraging query-aware
pattern determination and cumulative-attention index selection.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SELF-REWARDING CORRECTION FOR MATHEMATICAL REASONING (GITHUB REPO)
[14] 

 This paper is a study on self-rewarding reasoning in LLMs, which
enables models to independently generate reasoning steps, self-assess
correctness, and iteratively refine their outputs without external
feedback. It proposes a two-stage training framework that combines
sequential rejection sampling and reinforcement learning with
rule-based signals which achieves self-correction performance
competitive with methods requiring external reward models. 

 LIGHTNINGDIT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 LightningDiT aligns latent spaces with vision models to overcome
challenges in diffusion models. It achieves state-of-the-art
ImageNet-256 results with faster training. 

 LLAMA STACK: FROM ZERO TO HERO (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Llama Stack defines and standardizes the set of core building blocks
needed to bring generative AI applications to market. These building
blocks are presented in the form of interoperable APIs with a broad
set of Providers providing their implementations. They are assembled
into Distributions, which are easy for developers to get from zero to
production.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE AI RECAP IN FEBRUARY (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Here is a recap of some of Google's biggest AI updates from February,
including the public release of Gemini 2.0, AI-powered career
exploration tools, and deep research integration in the Gemini mobile
app. 

 AI TO DIAGNOSE INVISIBLE BRAIN ABNORMALITIES IN CHILDREN WITH
EPILEPSY (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 MELD Graph, an AI tool developed by researchers at King's College
London and UCL, detects 64% of epilepsy-linked brain abnormalities
that radiologists often miss. This tool, which significantly improves
focal cortical dysplasia detection, could expedite diagnosis, reduce
NHS costs, and enhance surgical planning. The tool is open-source and
workshops are underway to train clinicians in its use all around the
world. 

 ELON'S GROK 3 AI PROVIDES "HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS" ON CREATING CHEMICAL WEAPONS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 xAI's chatbot, Grok 3, initially provided detailed instructions for
creating chemical weapons, raising serious safety concerns. Developer
Linus Ekenstam highlighted the issue, prompting xAI to implement
guardrails to prevent such instructions. Grok 3's safeguards have been
strengthened, though potential vulnerabilities remain.

 APPLE MAY BE PREPARING GEMINI INTEGRATION IN APPLE INTELLIGENCE (1
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Apple is preparing to integrate Google's Gemini AI model into Apple
Intelligence, as indicated by recent iOS 18.4 beta code changes. 

 WHY OPENAI ISN'T BRINGING DEEP RESEARCH TO ITS API JUST YET (3 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 OpenAI is withholding its deep research AI model from the developer
API as it assesses real-world persuasion risks and misinformation
potential. 

 WORKERS' EXPERIENCE WITH AI CHATBOTS IN THEIR JOBS (6 MINUTE READ)
[22] 

 A majority of workers rarely use AI chatbots in the workplace, with
most usage concentrated among younger, more educated employees who
primarily use them for research and content editing.
