 AI-LED MERCHANDISING IS RESHAPING ECOMMERCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Leading retailers like Kiko Milano, Flaconi, and Maisons Du Monde are
using AI to boost conversions [4], automate repetitive tasks, and gain
full control of their merchandising—without relying on developers.

Want to know the secrets behind their success? Watch the Algolia
webinar recording [4] and learn how to turn your merchandising
challenges into growth opportunities — from dynamic re-ranking to
advanced personalization.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE IRONWOOD TPU (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 With improvements on podsize, bandwidth, memory, and overall flops,
the 7th generation of Google's TPUs is a step change improvement over
any chip on the market. 

 CLAUDE'S MAX PLAN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The new Max plan for Claude offers expanded usage with priority
access to features and models, supporting users with demanding
projects. It provides two levels: Expanded Usage for $100/month with
5x usage and Maximum Flexibility for $200/month with 20x usage. The
plan is ideal for those who frequently work with substantial documents
and complex data. 

 GROK API (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Grok 3 has an API for its models, including multiple reasoning modes.
This link includes pricing, which is reasonable given the assumed size
of the model itself. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OMNI SVG (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 By treating SVGs as a foreign language, a pretrained Qwen model can
generate novel SVGs based on text and images. It is easily the
state-of-the-art model. An open release is coming soon. 

 OLMOTRACE (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There is a debate in the language modeling world about how much a
model actually learns and how much it just memorizes. This feature, in
the AI2 Playground, searches through billions of input documents, in
real time, to figure out if the output of a model is just regurgitated
or if it is novel. It includes the source of the utterance from
multiple documents. 

 AI SCIENTIST V2 (PDF) [10] 

 Sakana AI had a research paper accepted to an ICLR workshop that was
fully generated, executed, and written by a language model system.
They improved their system by using VLMs, more general purpose search,
and more.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EFFICIENT MOE INFERENCE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 HybriMoE is a new framework for hybrid CPU-GPU inference on Mixture
of Experts models that tackles instability and overhead with smarter
scheduling and caching strategies. 

 DYNAMIC KNOWLEDGE CIRCUITS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This research explores how LLMs structurally internalize new
knowledge by analyzing computational subgraphs. It reveals patterns in
knowledge acquisition, optimization phases, and potential strategies
for improving continual pre-training. 

 PROTEIN BACKBONE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ReQFlow sets a new benchmark in protein backbone generation,
delivering state-of-the-art results while being significantly faster
than existing models. It is 37x faster than RFDiffusion and 62x faster
than Genie2 for sequences of length 300.

MISCELLANEOUS

 COGITO V1 PREVIEW: INTRODUCING IDA AS A PATH TO GENERAL
SUPERINTELLIGENCE (22 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Cognito team has released open-source LLMs ranging from 3B to 70B
parameters, all of which outperform top open models of similar sizes,
with the 70B model surpassing Llama 4 109B MoE. These models are
trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA), support
both direct and reflective answering, and are available on Hugging
Face, Ollama, Fireworks AI, and Together AI. 

 GENERATIVE MEDIA UPGRADES IN VERTEX AI (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Cloud has added enhanced generative tools to Vertex AI,
including new capabilities in text-to-music (Lyria), video editing
(Veo 2), voice customization (Chirp 3), and image inpainting (Imagen
3). 

 INTRODUCING FIREBASE STUDIO (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Firebase Studio is launching as a cloud-based development environment
for building, testing, and deploying AI applications. It combines
tools like Project IDX, Genkit, and Gemini within a unified platform,
offering rapid AI prototyping and a customizable coding workspace.
Developers can leverage features such as natural language prototyping,
instant device previews, and easy collaboration to accelerate app
development.
