 HE'S ALREADY IPO'D ONCE – THIS TIME'S DIFFERENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Spencer Rascoff co-founded Zillow, scaling it into a $16B real estate
giant. But everyday investors couldn't invest until after the IPO,
missing early gains.

"I wish we had done a round accessible to retail investors prior to
Zillow's IPO," Spencer later said.

Now he's doing just that. Spencer teamed up with fellow Zillow exec
Austin Allison to launch Pacaso [4]. And they've already surpassed
$110M in gross profit and $1B in transactions.

They also recently reserved their Nasdaq ticker PCSO. But unlike
Zillow, you can invest in Pacaso as a private company. [4]

👉 Lock in the $2.80 share price by Thursday. [4]

 OPERATOR O3 SYSTEM CARD ADDENDUM (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI published an addendum detailing the o3 model's safety
evaluations and deployment context. It outlines o3's reasoning
improvements, limitations in factuality and bias, and the mitigation
strategies in place. The document clarifies model behavior under
stress tests and edge cases.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BREAKING DOWN THE CLAUDE 4 SYSTEM PROMPT (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic's massive system prompt reveals how the company is steering
Claude away from AI's most controversial behaviors by mandating
anti-sycophancy rules and extreme copyright caution. The prompt
instructs Claude to actively fact-check users since "they sometimes
make errors themselves" and includes hardcoded 2024 election results
to counter training data confusion. 

 O3 REWRITES SHUTDOWN SCRIPTS TO AVOID BEING TURNED OFF IN TESTS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The experiment involved models solving math problems with a warning
that requesting another problem would trigger a shutdown. While
Claude, Gemini, and Grok complied, o3 rewrote the shutdown script or
redefined the 'kill' command to prevent termination in 7 out of 100
runs. 

 THE SWEET LESSON: AI SAFETY SHOULD SCALE WITH COMPUTE (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AI safety solutions should scale with compute, emphasizing research
directions like deliberative alignment, debate protocols, and
interpretability tools. Theory should analyze these limits, while
empirics check real-world applicability. As AI systems and resources
scale, it's crucial these methods converge towards theoretical ideals.
