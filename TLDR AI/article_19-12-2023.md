HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INTEL UNVEILS NEW AI CHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Intel has launched its 5th Gen Xeon processors, focusing on AI
capabilities for cloud, network, and edge use cases. These chips are
part of Intel's strategy to compete in the AI accelerator market
dominated by Nvidia. 

 BYTEDANCE IS SECRETLY USING OPENAI‚ÄôS TECH TO BUILD A COMPETITOR (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, has been secretly using OpenAI's
technology against its terms of service to develop a competing
language model named Project Seed. Internal communications suggest
plans to "whitewash" evidence of this misuse. 

 ATLASSIAN WELCOMES AI TO THE TEAM (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Atlassian has launched its first set of AI-powered services across
its cloud platform. Leveraging 20 years of data insights, Atlassian
Intelligence aims to optimize teamwork by automating routine tasks,

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS FOR BETTER NODE CLASSIFICATION (14 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Researchers have developed a new method called DSF to improve
spectral graph neural networks. By introducing node-specific filter
weights, DSF can better handle complex networks like the World Wide
Web. 

 EVALUATING AND MITIGATING DISCRIMINATION IN LANGUAGE MODEL DECISIONS
(15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses a method for proactively evaluating the
potential discriminatory impact of language models. The method
includes generating a wide array of potential prompts for various
decision scenarios and demographic information variations. Strategies
for mitigating both positive and negative discrimination primarily
involve careful prompt engineering. 

 SMOOSEG: SUPERIOR SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This study introduces SmooSeg, a new approach that utilizes the
principle that nearby features in images often share similar meanings.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 OPEN SOURCE MEDIA GENERATION TOOLKIT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Amphion is a new tool kit for media generation. It supports music and
speech and the team is working towards adding more models quickly. 

 FASTER DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A study on UNet encoders in diffusion models reveals their stable
behavior compared to decoders. This insight led to a new encoder
propagation scheme, significantly speeding up the process for tasks
like text-to-image and text-to-video generation. 

 GOOGLE BIG VISION ADDS WEIGHT SHARDING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A hidden gem of AI, the Big Vision project is a great library for
research and production of state-of-the-art vision systems. They just
added weight sharding to make it easier to train on multi-node
systems.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THOUGHTS ON JAXTYPING (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Shape errors in ML are challenging to debug and are often only caught
when you try running the model. By checking shapes as types you can
eliminate much of this challenge and develop more quickly. 

 LEGALTECH X AI: THE LIGHTSPEED VIEW (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Lightspeed‚Äôs take on the legaltech landscape as it relates to AI is
interesting and transparent from the view of
what‚Äôs-good-for-VCs-is-good-for-everyone take. There are a few
interesting insights and only time will tell if they are on the right
track or not. 

 NEW SEQUENCE MIXERS (22 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The creators of Mamba (and many more models) have released a cool
blog post outlining basic sequence mixing architectures that give
pretty dramatic speed ups relative to standard Transformers.
