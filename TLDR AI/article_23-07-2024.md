HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COHERE SEES VALUATION SOAR TO $5.5B AFTER NEW FUNDING ROUND (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Cohere, a Canadian AI startup focused on large language models, has
reached a $5.5B valuation following a $500M Series D funding round.
The new funds aim to enhance its enterprise-grade AI tech for global
business efficiency. Key investors include PSP Investments, Cisco,
Fujitsu, AMD Ventures, and EDC. 

 FIGMA AI UPDATE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Figma briefly rolled back its 'Make Designs' AI feature from its
limited beta after realizing it generated UI designs that too closely
resembled existing apps. The feature uses off-the-shelf AI models like
GPT-4 and Amazon's Titan and it needs refinement to ensure
originality. Figma aims to re-enable the feature with improved QA
processes to better assist designers in leveraging AI for efficient
design creation. 

 ELEVENLABS TURBO 2.5 MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ElevenLabs has introduced a new model, Turbo 2.5, that unlocks
high-quality low-latency conversational AI for nearly 80% of the world
- Hindi, French, Spanish, Mandarin, and 27 other languages. For the
first time, it supports Vietnamese, Hungarian, and Norwegian
text-to-speech. English is now 25% faster compared to Turbo v2.

MISCELLANEOUS

 USING LLMS FOR EVALUATION (33 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As large language models become more capable, evaluating them
accurately remains challenging due to their diverse tasks. While human
evaluation is the gold standard, it's costly and slow. Using LLMs
themselves as evaluators offers a scalable, cost-effective
alternative, despite potential biases such as positional and verbosity
bias, which can be mitigated through techniques like randomizing
output positions and using multiple evidence calibrations. 

 THREE ARCHETYPES OF AI APPLICATION STARTUPS (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI applications are evolving into three common archetypes: AI
Copilots that assist with tasks, AI Colleagues that autonomously
manage specific tasks alongside human workers, and AI-Native Services
which offer end-to-end services that integrate AI with human input.
GitHub Copilot and Devin exemplify AI Copilots and Colleagues, aiding
in coding and engineering, respectively. AI-Native Services, such as
Pilot for bookkeeping, compete with traditional service firms by
offering automated solutions in areas like law and accounting. 

 INSIDE THE FIGHT OVER CALIFORNIA'S NEW AI BILL (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 California state Senator Scott Wiener's Safe and Secure Innovation
for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models bill requires companies
training 'frontier models' that cost more than $100 million to do
safety testing and be able to shut off their models in the event of a
safety incident. The bill has received heavy criticism from the tech
industry. It will affect everyone who does business in California, not
just companies that develop their models in California. This article
contains an interview with Wiener about the bill and its critics.
