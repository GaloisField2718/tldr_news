HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

TURNING A FOUNDATION MODEL INTO A CHAT ASSISTANTS (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/starchat-alpha?utm_source=tldrai] 

Star coder is an excellent new model from the big code project that
can write 86 different programming languages. This post explores how
to prompt the model to participate in conversations, how to use chat
markup language, and even how to tune these models. Lots of
interesting tidbits here for groups interested in taking an open
source model and fine tuning it for their own chat-based use cases. 

CLAUDE‚ÄôS CONSTITUTION (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution?utm_source=tldrai]


Anthropic trained their language model Claude with a Constitutional AI
approach, giving the language model explicit values determined by a
set of constitutional principles drawn from a range of sources
including the UN declaration of human rights, instead of implicit
values determined by RLHF inputs. 

META OPEN-SOURCES MULTISENSORY AI MODEL (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716558/meta-imagebind-open-source-multisensory-modal-ai-model-research?utm_source=tldrai]


Meta has announced a new open-source AI model that links together
multiple streams of data, including text, audio, visual data,
temperature, and movement readings.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ONE EMBEDDING SPACE TO RULE THEM ALL (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.facebook.com/blog/imagebind-six-modalities-binding-ai/?utm_source=tldrai]


Embeddings in AI are representations of data that a computer can
operate on. For example, the clip model from OpenAI generates
embeddings for text and image. Meaning that you can get one embedding
for an image and its description. This work takes that to the next
level and generates embeddings for many different modalities which
enables multimodal learning. Specifically, their technique learns
embeddings across images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. 

LANGUAGE MODELS CAN EXPLAIN NEURONS IN OTHER LANGUAGE MODELS (12
MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models?utm_source=tldrai]


Neurons in a neural network ‚Äúactivate‚Äù based on different tasks.
Sometimes they are used to detect edges in images or letters in words.
However, they‚Äôre often extremely hard to interpret. It turns out we
can use a large language model to find interesting explanations for
neurons. For example, they found that in the network when the word
Dollar is predicted, neurons related to currency, buck, and America
activate. The procedure is fairly expensive and requires extremely
proficient large models, but is an exciting path towards finding
explainable circuits in neural networks. 

INTERNCHAT: A NEW VISUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCED INTERACTION WITH
CHATBOTS (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05662?utm_source=tldrai] 

This research introduces InternChat (iChat), a tool that combines
powerful chatbots like ChatGPT with non-verbal cues like pointing
movements, allowing users to directly manipulate images or videos. By
adding gestures to language, iChat makes communication with chatbots
more efficient and accurate, especially for tasks involving complex
visual scenarios, making it a promising development for future
interactive systems.

ENHANCING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH FEDERATED INSTRUCTION TUNING (24 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05644?utm_source=tldrai] 

The study introduces a new method, Federated Instruction Tuning
(FedIT), to train powerful language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4, by
learning from many different devices' data without violating privacy.
This makes the models better at understanding and responding naturally
in diverse situations, and the researchers have also created a tool,
'Shepherd', to help others use this approach easily. 

FRUGALGPT: COST-EFFECTIVE APPROACHES FOR UTILIZING LLMS (8 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05176?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study examines the high costs associated with using popular
language model APIs like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and J1-Jumbo, and suggests
three strategies for reducing these costs: prompt adaptation, LLM
approximation, and LLM cascade. The research introduces FrugalGPT, an
efficient application of the LLM cascade strategy that can match the
performance of top language models at a fraction of the cost or even
improve their accuracy. 

SUR-ADAPTER: AN UPGRADE FOR TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05189?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study introduces a new way, called SUR-adapter, to help computer
programs called diffusion models turn simple descriptions into
detailed images. By teaching these models to understand stories better
and using a new dataset of over 57,000 samples, the researchers made
the models better at creating high-quality images from simple
descriptions, making them easier and more fun to use.

MICROSOFT‚ÄôS COPILOT IS GETTING MORE FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23716591/microsoft-365-copilot-preview-expansion-ai-features-paid-access?utm_source=tldrai]


Microsoft is expanding preview access to its Microsoft 365 Copilot, a
digital assistant based on OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 that brings AI-powered
capabilities across Microsoft 365 apps and services. The tech giant
has also announced a new indexing tool that lets Copilot more
accurately report on internal company data, alongside some new Copilot
features for apps like Microsoft Whiteboard, Outlook, and PowerPoint.
