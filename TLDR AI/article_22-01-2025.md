 THE 5 GENAI TRENDS EVERY LEADER NEEDS TO PREPARE FOR IN 2025
⚡(SPONSOR) [4] 

 The Generative AI revolution has reached its reckoning. In 2025,
leaders face new challenges: Prove ROI, harness AI agents, and
transform governance into a strategic asset, or risk falling behind.
This report explores five critical shifts [4]:

 	* Build differentiated AI that sets you apart in a crowded
landscape.
 	* Prove ROI under intensified scrutiny.
 	* Control your existing LLMs before AI agents add complexity.
 	* Make governance your strategic advantage, not a safeguard.
 	* Equip your workforce with skills to thrive in an AI-first world.

The next chapter of AI belongs to those who can lead boldly and act
decisively. Get the trends report here [4].

 WHY ENTERPRISES NEED AI QUERY ENGINES TO FUEL AGENTIC AI (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 AI query engines enable enterprises to effectively utilize vast
amounts of both structured and unstructured data, bridging the gap
between raw data and AI-powered applications. They offer advanced
features like diverse data handling, scalability, accurate retrieval,
and continuous learning, enhancing the capabilities of AI agents.
Companies like DataStax are already leveraging these engines to
support applications in customer service, video search, and software
analysis. 

 OPENAI #10: REFLECTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Sam Altman discusses his unexpected firing from OpenAI's board and
reflects on its impact on governance and his leadership. He addresses
critiques about OpenAI's strategy, emphasizing the company's goal to
safely iterate towards AGI, while acknowledging high-profile
departures. Altman shares his thoughts on the potential risks of AGI
and hints at AI workforce integration by 2025, asserting that OpenAI
remains focused on building superintelligent systems for future
prosperity. 

 GOOGLE RESEARCHERS CAN CREATE AN AI THAT THINKS A LOT LIKE YOU AFTER
JUST A TWO-HOUR INTERVIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Stanford researchers created AI agents that replicate human behavior
with 85% accuracy by interviewing 1,052 people using a purpose-built
interface. The study, in collaboration with Google DeepMind, suggests
these agents could help decision-makers understand public opinions by
simulating responses to policies and product launches. While AI agents
performed well on personality tests, they struggled with replicating
human decisions in economic games.
