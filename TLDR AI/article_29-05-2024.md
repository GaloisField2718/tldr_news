 HIRE YOUR AI DREAM TEAM ‚Äî WITH EXPERTS FROM HARVARD, STANFORD, AND
MIT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Building an AI product is hard. Engineers who understand AI are
expensive and difficult to find. And there's no way of telling who's
legit and who's not.

That's why companies around the world trust AE Studio [4]. They'll
help you craft and implement the optimal Al solution for your business
with a team of world class Al experts [4].

Their development, design, and data science teams [4] work closely
with founders and executives to create custom software and Al
solutions [4] that get the job done for a fraction of the cost of
searching and hiring your own team.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI SAFETY BOARD (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI formed a Safety and Security Committee after announcing the
training of its new foundation model. This committee will be tasked
with issuing recommendations to the board about actions to take as
model capabilities continue to improve. 

 JAN LEIKE JOINS ANTHROPIC (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jan Leike, a former OpenAI researcher who resigned over AI safety
concerns, has joined Anthropic to lead a new "superalignment" team
focusing on AI safety and security. Leike's team will address scalable
oversight, weak-to-strong generalization, and automated alignment
research. 

 NEW AGENT CAPABILITIES IN MICROSOFT COPILOT UNLOCK BUSINESS VALUE (3
MINUTE READ) [7]

business process efficiency. The updates are currently in limited
private preview, with broader availability expected later in 2024.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 GZIP PREDICTS DATA-DEPENDENT SCALING LAWS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Scaling laws are a way to predict how well models will perform at
certain sizes with a certain amount of data. They are expensive to
obtain. This paper explores using gzip compression ratio as a strong
signal to predict a data-dependent scaling law. 

 SCHEDULE FREE OPTIMIZER (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A few weeks ago, a new optimizer from Meta made the rounds as a
promising alternative to Adam. This paper outlines the method in more
detail, including the online updates portion of the method. In
general, it seems like a promising result, especially when the total
number of desired training steps is unknown at the beginning of
training. 

 TRANSFORMERS LEARN TO SOLVE COMPLEX ARITHMETIC WITH NEW EMBEDDINGS
(18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have improved transformer performance on arithmetic tasks
by adding embeddings that encode each digit's position relative to the
start of the number.

 MARIGOLD DEPTH IN DIFFUSERS (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 One of the best depth models is now available as a pipeline in
diffusers. This tutorial discusses how to use the model, what you can
do with it, and a trick to make it work seamlessly with videos by
conditioning on the first frame's latents. 

 REPRODUCING GPT-2 (124M) IN LLM.C IN 90 MINUTES FOR $20 (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Andrej Karpathy has released an update to LLM C, a single self
contained GPT-2 implementation aimed at reproducing the 2019 suite of
models. With this most recent update, the library is able to train the
smallest of these models in just 90 minutes. It runs end to end and
has minimal dependencies. 

 IMPROVING MAKEUP TRANSFER (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) is a novel method
for enhancing makeup transfer tasks without relying on real target
images.

accuracy and action controllability for autonomous driving. 

 ‚ÄúI LOST TRUST‚Äù: WHY THE OPENAI TEAM IN CHARGE OF SAFEGUARDING
HUMANITY IMPLODED (9 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Key members of OpenAI's safety team, including leaders of the
superalignment team tasked with ensuring AI alignment, have departed
partly due to lost faith in CEO Sam Altman. These departures follow
internal conflicts and concerns about OpenAI's safety priorities and
the company's direction under Altman's leadership. OpenAI is updating
its offboarding documents after criticisms regarding potential equity
cancellations for those who refuse to sign non-disparagement
agreements. 

 WHAT GPT-4O ILLUSTRATES ABOUT AI REGULATION (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article discusses different approaches to AI regulation,
contrasting model-level, use-level, and conduct-level frameworks. It
argues that conduct-level regulation, which applies existing laws to
new technology without excessive specificity, is preferable to
use-level regulation, which could result in impractical restrictions
and unnecessary complications for AI deployment. The recent EU AI
Act's restrictions on AI's ability to infer emotions is cited as an
example of the pitfalls of a use-level approach.
