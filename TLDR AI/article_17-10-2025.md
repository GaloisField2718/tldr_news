 CLOSE THE GENAI SECURITY READINESS GAP WITH THIS BLUEPRINT BY ROB T.
LEE OF SANS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI adoption is accelerating, but most teams still lack the guidance
to secure, govern, and monitor it at scale.

Rob T. Lee, Chief of Research and AI Officer at SANS, developed the
SECURE AI BLUEPRINT — a 3-track model to help organizations protect,
utilize, and govern AI responsibly. It's a practical framework built
to close the AI security gap.

poisoning, prompt injection, and adversarial attacks.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE'S SKILLS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic has unveiled Claude Skills, modular task-specific packages
containing instructions, scripts, and resources. These make Claude
more effective at specialized tasks by loading relevant context only
when needed. 

 OPENAI DEVELOPS SHARED CHATGPT PROMPTS FEATURE FOR TEAMS (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's Prompts feature within team workspaces for ChatGPT appears
to be aimed at organizations. It creates a library of shared prompts
made by team members accessible across the team. Team members are able
to create prompt templates, set custom instructions, and integrate
variables. Teams will be able to package up complex, multistep tasks
into single prompts using built-in tools. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CLAUDE SKILLS ARE AWESOME, MAYBE A BIGGER DEAL THAN MCP (5 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Anthropic's new Skills feature consumes only dozens of tokens per
skill until needed compared to MCPs that can burn tens of thousands
upfront. The design is incredibly simple: drop instructions in a
folder and Claude figures out when to use them. This token efficiency
and model-agnostic approach (any coding agent can read the files) will
trigger a "Cambrian explosion" that makes the MCP rush look
pedestrian, especially since skills transform Claude Code from a
coding tool into a general automation agent capable of handling
anything you could accomplish by typing commands. 

 AI AT WORK: OPENAI'S WORKFORCE BLUEPRINT (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GPT-5-level models now match human professionals on roughly half of
economically valuable tasks, completing work in minutes that would
take a human hours. OpenAI has proposed a retraining program targeting
10 million Americans by 2030, acknowledging evidence that AI is
already displacing entry-level workers. The company frames AI as "more
enabler than replacer" despite proposing a massive retraining
initiative, which has historically failed to prevent job displacement
from technological change.

 ✂️ CUT YOUR QA CYCLES DOWN TO MINUTES WITH QA WOLF (SPONSOR) [11]


 If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team
and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA
Wolf [11].

QA Wolf's fully-managed, AI-native service SUPPORTS WEB AND MOBILE
APPS, delivering 80% automated test coverage in weeks [12] and helping
teams SHIP 5X FASTER by reducing QA cycles to minutes.

With QA Wolf, Drata's team of 80+ engineers [13] achieved 4x more test
cases and 86% FASTER QA CYCLES.

⭐ Rated 4.8/5 on G2. Trusted by Cohere, AutoTrader, Salesloft, and
many others.

 INTRODUCING SWE-GREP AND SWE-GREP-MINI: RL FOR MULTI-TURN, FAST
CONTEXT RETRIEVAL (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cognition trained specialized models that retrieve code context 10x
faster than frontier models by using RL to issue up to 8 parallel tool
calls per turn instead of the sequential searches typical agents use.
Speed matters more than the industry realizes because it allows
developers to stay in a flow state. 

 THE ART OF SCALING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COMPUTE FOR LLMS (24 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 ScaleRL is a framework for analyzing and predicting compute scaling
in LLM reinforcement learning. Their large-scale study shows that
stable training recipes yield predictable performance curves, aiding
efficient resource allocation. 

 RECURSIVE LANGUAGE MODELS (35 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Recursive Language Models (RLMs) can decompose and recursively
interact with their input context as a variable. An RLM using
GPT-5-mini outperforms GPT-5 with more than double the number of
correct answers on OOLONG while being cheaper per query on average.
RLMs outperform other methods ReAct + test-time indexing and retrieval
over the prompt without any degradation in performance when given over
10 million tokens at inference time. RLMs trained explicitly to
recursively reason are likely to be the next milestone in
general-purpose inference time scaling.

 INTRODUCING MANUS 1.5 (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Manus 1.5 adds full-stack web development that handles backend
infrastructure, databases, QA, and user authentication entirely,
achieved entirely through natural language. The agent can test apps by
itself and fix issues autonomously. 

 THRILLED TO SHARE I'VE JOINED OPENAI FOR SCIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [18]


 Alex Lupsasca has joined OpenAI for Science, a team aiming to build
AI systems to advance scientific reasoning and accelerate discovery in
math and physics. GPT-5 Pro has proven its ability to tackle hard
questions in science and produce answers that would take graduate
students several days of research time. AI can now touch the research
frontier. This is proof that AI will transform scientific research.
