 HACKERS STOLE MILLIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. DATA BROKERS SELL
THEM LEGALLY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Criminal hacker group USDoD has allegedly leaked 2.7BN records of
personal information — including names, addresses, dates of birth,
Social Security numbers, and phone numbers.

At the same time, legal data brokers are selling the same personal
data [4] (including SSNs!) to every spammer and scammer under the sun.

Hackers aren't your problem to solve. But you can do something about
those brazen data brokers, and that's sign up to Incogni today [4].
They'll send dozens of removal requests, deleting your personal data
[4] from the data brokers you know—and the ones you don't.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 HOPFIELD AND HINTON WIN PHYSICS NOBEL PRIZE (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Two scientists involved in the creation of the neural network win the
Nobel Prize in Physics. 

 ANTHROPIC BATCHES API (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has announced a new batch processing API that enables
developers to send batches of up to 10,000 queries per batch. Each
batch is processed in less than 24 hours and costs 50% less than
standard API calls. This makes processing non-time-sensitive tasks
more efficient and cost-effective. 

 UPDATE ON REFLECTION-70B (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A deep dive post mortem on what happened with the much hyped
Reflection-70B model. It had bugs in its benchmark code. Its team has
fixed them and performance is still very impressive, but not quite to
the level they claimed.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 WHAT MATTERS FOR MODEL MERGING AT SCALE (21 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Model merging is a way to combine two models and get the performance
of each. However, it doesn't always scale properly with model size.
This paper explores what is needed to make it work well with a really
large model. 

 NORMALIZED REPRESENTATIONS ON THE HYPERSPHERE (38 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Normalizing the internal representation of language models is the
target of a lot of resource activity. This work shows that if you put
every internal vector on a hypersphere, it dramatically decreases
convergence time for reasonably sized models. 

 CODEMMLU (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Language models are getting so good at writing code that many
benchmarks are saturating. This paper suggests a benchmark that is
harder and aims to determine how models perform on reasoning and code
generation tasks.

 COLOR LOGIT PRINTING IN THE TERMINAL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The intensify package is a nice way to show logprobs or other real
number modulated text based on the color of the terminal. 

 MEASURING VIDEO QUALITY IN AI (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 JEDi is a new metric based on Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture
(JEPA). It improves evaluation accuracy while needing fewer samples
and better aligning with human assessments, offering a stronger
alternative to FVD. 

 PLACE RECOGNITION FOR ROBOTICS (17 MINUTE READ) [16]

 FOUR-LEGGED ROBOT LEARNS TO CLIMB LADDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ETH Zurich used reinforcement learning to enable the ANYMal robot to
climb ladders with 90% success rate. Enhancing quadrupedal robots'
capabilities in industrial settings, the system improved climbing
speed by 232x compared to existing methods. This research highlights
the integration of robot morphology and advanced control policies. 

 THREE SUBTLE EXAMPLES OF DATA LEAKAGE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article explores the pitfalls of data leakage in machine
learning, highlighting two scenarios where improper data handling led
to misleading model performance. One company made the mistake of
filtering data based on an upper price limit before modeling, while
another faced issues by not adhering to a strict chronological split.
Key takeaways include the importance of detecting leakage and
understanding its impact on model accuracy. 

 THE REAL DATA WALL IS BILLIONS OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION (10 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 AI development faces potential challenges from a "data wall" as
language models approach training on all available text. This article
argues against relying on human analogies for overcoming data
limitations, highlighting the vast data and evolutionary processes
that contribute to human intelligence. While human learning strategies
might not directly apply to AI, this doesn't rule out other modalities
or algorithmic progress for advancing AI capabilities.
