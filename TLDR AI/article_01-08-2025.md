 CHINA CLAIMS NVIDIA BUILT BACKDOOR INTO H20 CHIP DESIGNED FOR CHINESE
MARKET (3 MINUTE READ) [5]

Chinese market to comply with US export restrictions, have location
tracking and that they can be remotely shut down. Major Chinese tech
groups have received informal guidance to increase purchases of
domestic AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia and support the
evolution of a rival domestic chip ecosystem.

 2025 MID-YEAR LLM MARKET UPDATE: FOUNDATION MODEL LANDSCAPE +
ECONOMICS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Foundation models are shaping the future of computing. Model API
spending has more than doubled in six months. Enterprises are
increasing production inference rather than just model development,
marking a shift from previous years. Code generation has become AI's
first breakout use case. While open source continues to advance,
Western labs have seen a slowdown in frontier breakthroughs, resulting
in enterprise dollars consolidating around a few high-performing,
closed-source models.

 THE XENO SUTRA: CAN MEANING AND VALUE BE ASCRIBED TO AN AI-GENERATED
“SACRED” TEXT? (29 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Buddhist scholars analyzed an AI-generated "sutra" created by ChatGPT
o3, finding sophisticated philosophical concepts and imagery that
effectively evokes core Buddhist teachings like emptiness through
paradoxical deconstruction. However, they warned that while LLMs can
recite dharma teachings, they lack true insight and may dangerously
convince users they're receiving true divine guidance when prompted
for spiritual advice.

 LEARNING THE BITTER LESSON (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The design philosophy for building AI applications is still in its
infancy. One thing we can predict is that models will get much better.
Designing AI applications to take advantage of this is probably the
most important thing. It's important to understand your application
structure, re-evaluate that structure as models improve, and make it
easy to remove structure. 

 NEURAL NETWORK COMPRESSION (12 MINUTE READ) [13]

fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian functions to
compress neural networks for edge deployment.
