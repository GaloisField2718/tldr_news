RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OLMO: OPEN LANGUAGE MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI2 released a fully open language model training framework. The
models come with comprehensive resources including full training data,
model weights, training and evaluation code, over 500 checkpoints for
each model, and future plans for fine-tuning code, all released under
the Apache 2.0 License. These resources are provided by AI2‚Äôs Dolma
and WIMBD. They include evaluation frameworks Catwalk and Paloma and
support for analysis and fine-tuning through Weights & Biases logs and
HuggingFace revisions. The models are competitive with the best in
class. 

 MOBILEDIFFUSION (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has showcased a latent consistency diffusion model with some
architectural changes that it trained to run on mobile devices with
sub-second generation times. 

 ENHANCED VIDEO-TEXT LEARNING (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Shared Network Pre-training (SNP) improves learning of video and text
together. This method is more efficient and versatile than previous
models and includes a unique strategy called Significant Semantic
Strengthening (S3) for better understanding of key words in sentences.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WORKSHOP: BETTER RAG WITH SYNTHETIC DATA (SPONSOR) [11] 

 RAG is all the rage. Get insider tips on how to build more robust RAG
in this upcoming virtual workshop [11]!
Learn how to use Gretel‚Äôs Tabular LLM [11] to create diverse
synthetic datasets for RAG evaluation. The session will be led by Sam
Kemp, Principal AI Platform Architect at Microsoft, and the Gretel
product team. Join live on Feb 05 [11]

 NEW STATE OF THE ART IN OPEN EMBEDDING MODEL (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [12] 

 The BGE-M3 project introduces a versatile embedding model that excels
in Multi-Functionality (dense, multi-vector, and sparse retrieval),
Multi-Linguality (supporting over 100 languages), and
Multi-Granularity (handling inputs from short sentences to documents
up to 8192 tokens). It uses a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines
different methods and re-ranking for higher accuracy and
generalization, leveraging its ability to perform embedding and sparse
retrieval simultaneously. 

 HIERARCHICAL TEXT SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been enhanced to create Hi-SAM,
a model specializing in hierarchical text segmentation. Hi-SAM excels
in segmenting text across multiple levels - from strokes to paragraphs
- and even performs layout analysis. 

 RAGS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 RAGs is a Streamlit app that lets users create RAG pipelines from
data sources using natural language. Users just have to describe the
tasks and parameters they want from their RAG systems. The RAG can be
queried and it will answer questions over the data.

models for enterprise use. This could be essential for businesses
looking to de-risk AI and harness its true potential while adhering to
internal or external guidelines and regulations. 

 YOU ARE NOT LATE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Just as the early days of the internet offered immense opportunities,
today's AI landscape holds similar potential. The key is to shift
perception to see the possibilities in existing technologies like AI
and follow passion and joy to explore various paths.
