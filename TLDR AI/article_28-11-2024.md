 🎄 DON'T LET DATA BROKERS STEAL YOUR HOLIDAY PEACE—PROTECT YOUR
PRIVACY FOR JUST $6.29/MONTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The holidays are here, and so are the _cyber risks_—your personal
data is on sale, and the buyer could be anyone. A legal loophole
allows data brokers to collect your personal information and sell it
to the highest bidder.

This holiday season, give yourself the gift of security and peace of
mind. You can either:

1️⃣ Contact dozens of data brokers individually to get your data
removed;

2️⃣ Or sign up for INCOGNI, and let them handle it all for you.

Incogni contacts dozens of data brokers on your behalf — getting
your data off the web, and making sure it stays off.

✅ Over 20,000,000 data removals completed to date

Delete your personal data today. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 QWEN'S FIRST REASONING INSPIRED MODEL QWQ (22 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Qwen has released a 32B parameter reasoning model that performs
similarly to OpenAI's o1 series of models. The company observed
scaling performance when sampling longer reasoning traces. The model
is available to use and excels at mathematics and coding. 

 OPENAI TRADEMARKING O1 REASONING MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI has filed a trademark application for its latest AI model, o1,
as the firm moves to shield its IP. 

 ELEVENLABS' NEW FEATURE IS A NOTEBOOKLM COMPETITOR FOR CREATING GENAI
PODCASTS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ElevenLabs has introduced GenFM, a feature in its iOS app that
creates AI-generated multispeaker podcasts from uploaded content.
Supporting 32 languages, the feature adds natural human elements like
'ums' and pauses to enhance authenticity in the podcast experience.
ElevenLabs has planned further customization options and an expansion
into new markets, including India and Poland.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMAGE EDITING ON THE VIDEO MANIFOLD (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In early image synthesis, traversing the latent space was a great way
to generate diverse images. Now, the same can be done with video to
generate sequential edits to a single image while maintaining semantic
consistency. 

 LOW-BIT QUANTIZATION FAVORS UNDERTRAINED LLMS (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Models trained for less time on fewer tokens experience less
degradation when being quantized after training. This suggests, as has
been seen in other work, that models use the extra precision to fully
compress more and more information during extended training. 

 FASTER INFERENCE FOR LONG SEQUENCES WITH STAR ATTENTION (17 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Star Attention offers a block-sparse approach to speed up
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) during long-sequence
inference. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SKETCH AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SketchAgent leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal LLM to facilitate
language-driven, sequential sketch generation through an intuitive
sketching language. It can sketch diverse concepts, engage in
interactive sketching with humans, and edit content via chat. 

 REAL-TIME 3D RECONSTRUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A deep-learning-based dense visual SLAM framework that achieves
real-time global optimization of poses and 3D reconstruction. 

 PROTEIN ENSEMBLE GENERATIVE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 P2DFlow is a protein ensemble generative model with SE(3) flow
matching based on ESMFold. The ensembles generated by P2DFlow could
aid in understanding protein functions across various scenarios. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 CRADLE BIO SERIES B (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Cradle has solved a critical challenge in optimizing protein shapes.
It is now expanding its team and efforts to land this technology in
the hands of practitioners everywhere. 

 TEACH MODE, RABBIT'S TOOL FOR AUTOMATING R1 TASKS, IS NOW AVAILABLE
TO ALL USERS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Rabbit R1 has introduced a teach mode feature which allows users to
train its AI to automate tasks on any website. Aiming to improve
functionality and productivity, the feature supports complex
multi-platform interactions. It potentially offers a better experience
than using dedicated apps. Rabbit envisions a marketplace for
user-created automations. It is hoping for broader adoption despite
potential platform challenges. 

 OK, I CAN PARTLY EXPLAIN THE LLM CHESS WEIRDNESS NOW (20 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Recent experiments suggest that GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct can play chess
well compared to other LLMs due to potential differences in base model
training and data quality. Various prompting techniques and examples
enhanced chess performance of other models like GPT-4o, though not to
the same extent. The analysis indicates OpenAI's strategy might
involve curating high-quality chess data for better LLM performance.

 INTRODUCING SHOWUI-2B (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The team behind ShowUI has introduced a vision-language-action model
designed to improve how AI interacts with graphical user interfaces. 

 MIT RESEARCHERS DEVELOP AN EFFICIENT WAY TO TRAIN MORE RELIABLE AI
AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 MIT researchers have developed an efficient algorithm for enhancing
reinforcement learning models that involves strategically selecting
training tasks for improved decision-making in variable environments. 

 APPLE AGAIN SNUBS AI IN ITS 'IPHONE APP OF THE YEAR' FINALISTS (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Apple's 2024 iPhone App of the Year finalists largely exclude
AI-driven apps, favoring traditional applications like Kino and Runna,
though some AI apps are recognized in iPad and Mac categories.
