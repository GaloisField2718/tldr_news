RESEARCH & INNOVATION

HYPERDIFFUSION: GENERATING IMPLICIT NEURAL FIELDS WITH WEIGHT-SPACE
DIFFUSION (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://ziyaerkoc.com/hyperdiffusion/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Neural fields use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to represent a 3D
scene. It turns out you can apply diffusion directly to the weights of
the MLP and generate a novel 3D scene. 

ONE WIDE FEEDFORWARD IS ALL YOU NEED (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01826?utm_source=tldrai] 

The feedforward layers of the transformer make up a significant
portion of the total weights in the network. However, if you use a
single large feedforward layer shared between the encoder and decoder,
you can dramatically improve inference time with minimal drops in
performance. 

USING LLMS TO PREDICT STOCK TRENDS (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03079v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper introduces a way to use large language models to quickly
analyze long Annual Reports from companies, making it easier to
understand their financial health and even predict stock prices.

GENERATIVE IMAGE RESTORATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/XPixelGroup/DiffBIR?utm_source=tldrai] 

Powerful upscaling and restoration models that use diffusion to reduce
blur and sharpen image details. Model checkpoints included. 

A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF 3D SCENES OVER TIME (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://markomih.github.io/ResFields/?utm_source=tldrai] 

ResFields is a new kind of neural network that's really good at
understanding complex 3D scenes as they change over time. By adding
something called 'temporal residual layers,' it can deal with a lot
more information and still stay accurate. 

ONPREM.LLM (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/amaiya/onprem?utm_source=tldrai] 

OnPrem.LLM is a simple Python package that makes it easier to run
large language models on non-public or sensitive data and on machines
with no internet connectivity.

USING AI TO CREATE BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://medium.com/proteinqure/proteinqures-recent-breakthrough-a-smart-breast-cancer-drug-912d36d78b7d?utm_source=tldrai]


ProteinQure revolutionizes chemotherapy using advanced ML and
molecular simulations on supercomputers. Using their platform -
ProteinStudio - they designed PQ-001, a precision drug targeting
breast cancer. This drug, akin to a guided missile, zeroes in on
cancer cells, sparing the healthy ones and avoiding common chemo side
effects. Following successful animal trials, they're now developing
this drug further towards the first dose in humans.
