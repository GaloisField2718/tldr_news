 DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR ETHICAL AND USER-FOCUSED AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In this paper [4], Algolia outlines key design principles to promote
the responsible development of GenAI applications, with a focus on
ethical considerations and user-centered practices.

These considerations include testing for harms, understanding user
mental models, addressing trust and reliability, accounting for the
imperfect nature of genAI responses, and more.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NVIDIA-BACKED REFLECTION AI RAISES $2 BILLION IN FUNDING, BOOSTS
VALUATION TO $8 BILLION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Founded last year by former DeepMind researchers, Reflection AI is
developing tools to automate software development, attracting
investors including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Citi, and Donald
Trump Jr.-backed 1789 Capital in a round that marks a sharp jump from
its $545 million valuation just months ago. 

 GEMINI ENTERPRISE: THE NEW FRONT DOOR FOR GOOGLE AI IN YOUR WORKPLACE
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gemini Enterprise is an AI-powered conversational platform designed
to bring the full power of Google AI to every employee for every
workflow. It enables users to chat with their company's documents,
data, and applications, and also gives them tools to build and deploy
AI agents. Gemini Enterprises comes with a suite of pre-built agents
grounded in company information and personal context. 

 EVEN AFTER STARGATE, ORACLE, NVIDIA, AND AMD, OPENAI HAS MORE BIG
DEALS COMING SOON, SAM ALTMAN SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is involved in major deals with AMD and Nvidia, acquiring
significant stakes in these companies, while planning to develop
next-gen AI GPUs and data centers. CEO Sam Altman indicates more
partnerships are imminent as OpenAI aims to ramp up infrastructure to
meet future demand. Despite current revenue not matching extensive
investment, Altman remains confident that these strategic moves will
drive future economic returns.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STATE OF AI REPORT (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Air Street Capital's eighth annual State of AI Report, a trusted
industry benchmark, finds OpenAI still leads on research but China's
open-weight ecosystems is close beyond with 40% of all new fine-tunes
on Hugging Face powered by Qwen.AI software adoption is firmly
mainstream with 44% of US businesses now paying for AI (up from 5% in
2023) and average contract values hitting $530k in 2025. Capability
per dollar doubles every 3.4 months for DeepMind and 5.8 months for
OpenAI, but AI safety budgets remain anemic at just $133M combined
across 11 major organizations, less than what frontier labs burn in a
day. 

 PRIVATE LLM TRAINING (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Opacus now supports Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), improving
memory efficiency and scalability for private training of large
language models.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 STOP PULLING DEVELOPERS INTO QA. (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Testing slows developers down. Every hour spent investigating
failures, fixing flaky tests, or running regressions delays releases
and limits what your team can ship.

QA Wolf [11] takes testing off your team's plate by combining AI [12]
with expert QA engineers to build and maintain 80% automated coverage
[13] in weeks, not months.

Tests run in parallel, suites finish in minutes, and failures are
real—not false alarms. Workflows stay current as your app evolves,
and brittle tests are repaired automatically.  

Developers get clean feedback fast, stay focused on features, and
releases ship faster with fewer surprises.

 SORA MCP (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Sora MCP allows LLMs to create Sora videos, check generation status,
download videos to local directories, and remix existing videos with
new prompts 

 SCALABLE IN-CONTEXT RANKING WITH GENERATIVE MODELS (1 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 In-content Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information
Retrieval that leverages contextual understanding of LLMs to identify
relevant documents. It is effective, but not efficient. This paper
introduces a novel method that reduces attentional complexity from
quadratic to linear without loss in performance and improves retrieval
in attention. The method matches or outperforms existing
state-of-the-art listwise rankers. It can scale gracefully to
long-context shortlists, presenting a scalable and effective solution
to ICR. 

 A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES CAN POISON LLMS OF ANY SIZE (10 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A joint study between Anthropic, the UK AI Security Institute, and
the Alan Turing Institute found that just 250 poisoned documents
(0.00016% of training data) can create backdoor vulnerabilities in
models from 600M to 13B parameters. Attack success didn't depend on
the proportion of the training corpus at any scale, just the absolute
number of documents. The research tested denial-of-service backdoors
where trigger phrases like SUDO make models output gibberish.

 AMAZON TAKES SHOTS AT CHATGPT WITH QUICK SUITE - YOUR NEW AI
'TEAMMATE' AT WORK (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Amazon's Quick Suite is an agentic AI experience for enterprises that
uses conversational language to find what users need. It acts as a hub
that pulls data from various sources like files, enterprise systems,
databases, and the web. Users can use Quick Suite to discuss
questions, build personalized agents, and complete tasks while
leveraging data protections. AWS offers a free 30-day trial for the
feature. 

 OPENAI IS A CONSUMER COMPANY (8 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI's DevDay announcements and its ChatGPT shopping feature show
that the company is heading towards being a consumer company. The
DevDay announcements were all consumer-oriented. This wasn't the
direction the company seemed to be moving in even a year ago, when it
seemed naturally oriented to developers. OpenAI appears to be trying
to be everything to everyone, which may actually be a rational
approach.
