RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DARKBERT: UNVEILING THE DARK WEB WITH A SPECIALIZED AI (18 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08596?utm_source=tldrai] 

DarkBERT is a new AI that's been trained specifically on the unique
language used in the Dark Web, which is different from what you'd find
on the regular internet. By comparing it to other AIs and looking at
various use cases, we've found that DarkBERT is better at
understanding and working with Dark Web text, making it a useful tool
for future research in this area. 

SYMBOL TUNING: ENHANCING AI LEARNING WITH SYMBOLIC LABELS (21 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08298?utm_source=tldrai] 

Symbol tuning is a new way to train AIs, where we replace normal
language labels (like "positive" or "negative") with random symbols
(like "foo" or "bar"), forcing the AI to learn from the connections
between inputs and labels. This method improves the AI's performance
on new tasks, helps it understand instructions better, and makes it
more skilled at logical reasoning tasks, with significant improvements
seen across different benchmarks. 

BOUNDLESS DAS: UNDERSTANDING THE MYSTERIES OF LARGE AI MODELS (14
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08809?utm_source=tldrai] 

Boundless DAS is a new method we've developed to better understand how
large AI models, like Alpaca, work on the inside, by looking for
understandable patterns in their behavior. We've found that Alpaca
solves a simple number problem by using two understandable variables
in a consistent way, no matter what the inputs or instructions are,
which is an important step towards understanding how these complex AI
models really work.

STARCODER IN GGML (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/pull/146?utm_source=tldrai] 

GGML is a framework for running 4-bit quantized models on the CPU.
This means you can run really large models locally on your laptop.
Starcoder is one of the very best open source program synthesis
models. Scoring very well on the challenging OpenAI human eval
benchmark. This pull request adds that model to the GGML framework
which means you can run starcoder on commodity hardware.
