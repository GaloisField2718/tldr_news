 ⚡️ WARP'S BIG AGENTS UPDATE CATAPULTS IT TO #1 ON TERMINAL-BENCH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Warp just launched its biggest Agents update yet, propelling it to #1
on Terminal-Bench and #5 on SWE-bench Verified [4], ahead of Claude
Code and Codex CLI.

Warp's #1 Agent now includes:

✅ FULL TERMINAL USE: agents can interact with long-running commands
like servers, debuggers, and more.

✅ STEERABLE PLANNING: review and edit plans as agents work to stop
them going off the rails.

✅ FULL LIFECYCLE: planning → coding → deployment

With OVER 700K USERS and 56% OF THE FORTUNE 500 on board, Warp [4] is
emerging as the platform of choice for developers.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI 3 FLASH (7 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google has introduced Gemini 3 Flash, a fast, lightweight model
designed to deliver frontier-level intelligence with lower latency.
It's built to help users quickly learn, plan, and build across a range
of everyday tasks and applications. 

 GOOGLE WORKS TO ERODE NVIDIA'S SOFTWARE ADVANTAGE WITH META'S HELP (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google and Meta are working together on a new initiative to make
Google's Tensor Processing Units better at running PyTorch. The move
is aimed at weakening Nvidia's longstanding dominance in the AI
computing market. TorchTPU will remove a key barrier that has slowed
the adoption of TPU chips. It will make existing infrastructure built
using PyTorch software fully compatible with TPUs. Google is
considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake. 

 GROK VOICE AGENT API (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI has opened up the voice stack powering Grok in Tesla vehicles to
all developers. The API ranks #1 on Big Bench Audio with sub-1-second
time-to-first-audio at $0.05 per minute (half the cost of OpenAI's
Realtime API).

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE SQUISHY NUMBER BEHIND THE RISE AND FALL OF ORACLE'S STOCK (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Oracle is down 43% from its September high despite reporting $523
billion in "remaining performance obligations". About $300 billion of
that comes from a five-year OpenAI contract, but analysts are
skeptical that OpenAI, which only has ~$20B in annualized revenue,
will be able to pay. Nvidia's stalled $100 billion OpenAI investment
(announced in September but still unsigned) compounds the anxiety over
the circular deals plaguing AI infrastructure. 

 YES, AGI CAN HAPPEN – A COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Current models vastly underutilize hardware: DeepSeek-V3 and Llama-4
achieve only ~20% FLOP utilization during training, and inference runs
at single-digit utilization because autoregressive models are
bottlenecked on loading weights from memory, not compute. Models we
see today are also lagging indicators, trained on last-gen hardware
that's unoptimized for the massive size of modern clusters and the
latest training methods. 

 WHEN AGENTS ATTACK: HOW AI COLLAPSES AND REBUILDS MARKETPLACE MOATS
(11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents, like those launched by OpenAI, threaten marketplace moats
by taking over discovery, transactions, and supply workflows, thus
collapsing traditional marketing funnels. Marketplaces must adapt by
optimizing brand experiences, personalizing interactions, and
integrating supply to maintain value. Founders should focus on
high-frequency markets, fortify customer connections, and explore new
monetization strategies like subscriptions or data licensing to stay
competitive.

 WHAT ACTUALLY IS CLAUDE CODE'S PLAN MODE? (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Plan mode is a feature in Claude Code that pauses execution until
users approve of a plan. A plan in Claude Code is a markdown file
written into Claude's plans folder by Claude in plan mode. Users can
review and edit the plan before Claude executes whatever task it needs
to. The tool brings in more complexity into the user interface, taking
away some of the magic. It replicates something that natural language
can already do, making the user experience a little less natural. 

 BUILD INTERACTIVE MINI APPS WITH OPAL IN THE GEMINI APP (1 MINUTE

 Opal is a tool for building AI-powered mini apps. It is now directly
available in the Gemini web app. Users can use it to create
experimental Gems to unlock even more customized Gemini experiences.
The tool can be found in the Gems manager.

 JASSY TAPS 27-YEAR AMAZON VETERAN TO RUN AGI ORG, WHICH IS NOW
DEFINITELY A THING THAT EXISTS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Peter DeSantis, SVP of Utility Computing at AWS, is taking two of his
teams from AWS and putting them into a unit called 'AGI'. The unit
will report directly to Andy Jassy, Amazon's Lead Product Market for
GenAI and CEO. AI and AI-related compute is now an all-Amazon thing,
not just an AWS thing. The unit is building things that are so
important that Amazon is taking one of its most senior AWS leaders and
putting him in charge of all of it. 

 INSIDE CHINA'S 'MANHATTAN PROJECT' TO RIVAL THE WEST IN AI CHIPS (8
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chinese scientists have built a working prototype of an EUV
lithography machine, the $250 million tool that only ASML knows how to
make and which the US has blocked from being sold to China since 2018.
A team of former ASML engineers reverse-engineered the machines in a
high-security Shenzhen lab, with recruits given fake IDs and signing
bonuses up to $700,000. The prototype hasn't yet produced working
chips, but sources expect it will by 2028-2030.
