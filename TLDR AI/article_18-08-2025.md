 1PASSWORD RESEARCH FINDS THAT SECURITY LEADERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH
UNMANAGED AI ACCESS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI is changing how we work, but adoption is outpacing our ability to
secure it. Our research found that _only 21% of security leaders
report having full visibility into the AI tools used in their
organization_. That lack of visibility represents an unacceptable risk
to organizational security. 

That's not all. Security leaders are also struggling with: 

	* AI policy enforcement
	* Unintentional exposure of sensitive data to AI
	* Unmanaged and shadow AI 

Here's the takeaway: Security leaders are all too aware of the risks
posed by AI, but are underequipped to address them. 

Read the research and learn how to mitigate AI access risks. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI RELEASES WARMER GPT-5 PERSONALITY (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is rolling out a friendlier version of GPT-5 with subtle
changes after users complained the model felt too formal and that they
missed 4o's personality, though internal testing shows no increase in
sycophancy. 

 CLAUDE OPUS 4 AND 4.1 CAN NOW END A RARE SUBSET OF CONVERSATIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic granted its most advanced models the ability to end
conversations as a last resort against persistently harmful or abusive
interactions, developed partly as an exploration into AI welfare and
moral status.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 TEACHING GPT-5 TO USE A COMPUTER (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Archon is a copilot for Mac and Windows that takes natural language
instructions and then performs tasks by taking screenshots, using
GPT-5 to create a plan, and then using a custom fine-tuned model to
execute clicks and keystrokes. The copilot uses GPT-5's powerful
reasoning, combined with tiny fine-tuned models, to control any
interface through natural language. This article looks at how Archon
was built. 

 RANKING THE CHINESE OPEN MODEL BUILDERS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This ranking evaluates 19 Chinese labs, not on the raw capabilities
of their models, but on their contributions to AI research. Deepseek
reigns as a top lab, despite recent quiet periods, with newer
companies like Moonshot AI and Zhipu closing the gap after their
recent releases of K2 and GLM-4.5, respectively. 

 35 THOUGHTS ABOUT AGI AND 1 ABOUT GPT-5 (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The impact of advanced AI far outpaces our understanding of advanced
AI—a disconnect that will only widen as we race toward AGI. This
sprawling list tackles the fundamental philosophical questions about
these systems: Why do teenagers master driving in weeks while Waymo
burns through millions of hours? How can LLMs store vastly more facts
than human brains despite having fewer connections? Does the 7-month
doubling of AI task complexity represent something deeper about
cognition itself? 

 THE STATE OF AI 2025 (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI startups are growing like nothing we've ever seen - some hit $100M
ARR in their first year. Bessemer studied 20 companies and found two
types: Supernovas that explode to $125M by year two but have 25% gross
margins and fragile retention, and Shooting Stars that quadruple
yearly with 60% margins. The new benchmark isn't T2D3 anymore, it's
Q2T3 (quadruple, quadruple, triple, triple, triple).

 MEET TURING: THE TRUSTED, _INDEPENDENT_ RESEARCH ACCELERATOR OF
LEADING AI LABS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Training frontier models? Turing [11] remains the independent choice
for the world's top AI teams — from multimodal training to RL gyms.
1000s of domain-trained experts across 60+ languages, 700+ benchmark
tasks built from real-world business and STEM use cases, 50+ frontier
projects supported successfully. Ask about free migration paths [11] 

 GPT-5 CODING TIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI shared a cheat sheet outlining best practices for using GPT-5
in coding scenarios, including prompt design, function calling, and
tool use. 

 BUILDING A WEB SEARCH ENGINE FROM SCRATCH IN TWO MONTHS WITH 3
BILLION NEURAL EMBEDDINGS (34 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A solo dev built a complete web search engine from the ground up in
just two months, leveraging 200 GPUs to generate 3 billion neural
embeddings across 280 million indexed pages. The project uses
transformer-based embeddings, a dramatic improvement over traditional
keyword matching, as it supports much more complex queries.

 CHATGPT APP $2B REVENUE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Since launching in 2023, ChatGPT's mobile app has reached $2B in
consumer spending, with an average return of $2.91 per install, vastly
outpacing other AI mobile apps. 

 GPT-5 HAS A HIDDEN SYSTEM PROMPT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 GPT-5, when accessed via the OpenAI API, has its own hidden system
prompt that is independent from the system prompt users specify in
their API calls. It is very resistant to sharing the details of this
secret system prompt. The prompt seems to specify a level of
'oververbosity' where the assistant prioritizes direct answers with
minimal extra content and keeps explanations short unless users ask
for more.

 I VIBE-CODED A TRITON KERNEL (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Triton implementation of GPT-OSS was included in the release, but
the kernels are forward-only - this developer vibe-coded their own
kernel to use for training. 

 OPEN WEIGHT LLMS EXHIBIT INCONSISTENT PERFORMANCE ACROSS PROVIDERS (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Customers of open weight model providers will have to be careful to
make the right choice. 

 GOOGLE DEVELOPS PROJECTS FEATURE FOR GEMINI (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Gemini's Projects feature enables the assistant to run Research tasks
across uploaded files.
