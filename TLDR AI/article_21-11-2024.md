 FYI: AI IS ALREADY MAKING ONE MILLION PHONE CALLS A DAY ON BEHALF OF
SOME COMPANIES 🤯 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 👋 Say hi to Bland, the world's most realistic AI phone-calling
agent [4]

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It
can:

🗣️ Respond in any voice or language.

🦾 It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for
some of the world's largest businesses.

For enterprises [5], it's been a financial game changer across sales,
operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect
employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, give it a call yourself [4].

MISCELLANEOUS

 PANORADAR: ROBOTS GAIN SUPERHUMAN VISION WITH AI AND RADIO WAVES (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 PanoRadar is an AI-powered system developed by researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania that converts radio waves into 3D views,
providing robots with LiDAR-like vision at a lower cost. It overcomes
limitations faced by conventional sensors in environments with smoke,
fog, and glass by using AI algorithms to process radio wave
reflections. The research team aims to integrate PanoRadar with
existing sensing technologies for enhanced multi-modal perception in
robotics. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF THE CREATOR (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Generative AI is revolutionizing the creator economy by significantly
lowering production barriers, enabling creators to generate
high-quality content with ease. AI-driven innovations, such as digital
clones, are poised to redefine content distribution and engagement,
offering new monetization opportunities by scaling creator
interactions and fan transactions. As AI continues to reshape
creation, distribution, and monetization, the creator economy is set
to spawn a new wave of significant technology companies. 

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND HAS A NEW WAY TO LOOK INSIDE AN AI'S “MIND” (9
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 DeepMind has released Gemma Scope, a tool that reveals AI model
patterns and decision-making processes and enhances understanding of
AI outputs through mechanistic interpretability. It uses sparse
autoencoders to dissect and analyze data layers, aiding in uncovering
biases or errors, like erroneous numerical interpretations. By
advancing model transparency, researchers hope to refine AI control
and alignment and reduce risks in deployment.
