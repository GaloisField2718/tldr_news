 CLAUDE IN XCODE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Xcode 26.3 introduces native support for Claude Agent SDK, enabling
full agentic capabilities like subagents, background tasks, and
plugins within Apple's IDE. This brings Claude Code's functionality
directly into developers' workflows. 

 INTEL IS MOVING INTO GPUS AND HAS HIRED A CHIEF ARCHITECT, CEO LIP-BU
TAN SAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Intel is expanding into the GPU market by hiring a new chief
architect, as announced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. GPUs are crucial for AI
infrastructure and are in high demand, driven by LLMs. Despite recent
challenges, Intel's stock has rallied, buoyed by optimism in its
foundry business and significant investments. 

 OPENAI POACHED ITS NEW SAFETY EXECUTIVE FROM ANTHROPIC (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI hired Dylan Scandinaro from Anthropic as its new "head of
preparedness." Scandinaro emphasized the rapid advancement of AI and
the associated risks. He stressed the urgency of addressing these
challenges.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPEN SOURCE AI ECOSYSTEM (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog explores open-source AI trajectory since the "DeepSeek
Moment," highlighting long-term strategies by major organizations and
forecasting sustained momentum through open artifact sharing and
deployment-first design. 

 DEEP DIVE: HOW CLAUDE CODE'S /INSIGHTS COMMAND WORKS (22 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The /insights command in Claude Code generates an HTML report that
analyzes usage patterns across a user's Claude Code sessions. The tool
is designed to help users understand how they interact with Claude,
what's working well, where friction occurs, and how to improve
workflows. This post takes a look at how the tool works. For better
insights, use Claude Code regularly, give feedback, don't filter
yourself, and check in monthly to see how patterns evolve. 

 EXPENSIVELY QUADRATIC: THE LLM AGENT COST CURVE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 It doesn't take much to start spending a significant amount of tokens
on context. This problem compounds as conversations get longer and
only gets exponentially more important with agent and subagent
workflows. Agent developers need to keep this problem in mind when
developing AI tools. This post provides an interactive tool that shows
how quickly context size can take up a large percentage of a cache
read.

 QWEN3-CODER-NEXT FOR AGENTIC CODING (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Alibaba's Qwen3-Coder-Next is a new open-weight model fine-tuned for
coding agents. Built on a hybrid MoE architecture, it excels in
executable synthesis and RL-based environment interaction, achieving
strong agentic coding performance at lower inference cost. 

 GLM-OCR (HUGGING FACE REPO) [15] 

 GLM-OCR is a multimodal OCR model for complex document understanding.
It integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale
image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient
token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. The model
delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse
document layouts. An SDK for efficient and convenient use is
available. 

 PERPLEXITY CANNOT ALWAYS TELL RIGHT FROM WRONG (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Perplexity is a function that measures models' overall level of
surprise when encountering a particular output. It has gained
significant traction in recent years as both a loss function and as a
simple-to-compute metric of model quality. However, it may be an
unsuitable metric for model selection. Perplexity will not always
select for the most accurate model - any increase in model confidence
must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new
model to be selected. 

 800K+ VERIFIABLE SWE TASKS (18 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 SWE-Universe presents a scalable method for generating verifiable
software engineering environments from GitHub PRs. With in-loop
hacking detection and self-verification, the system enables
large-scale mid-training for coding agents, producing over 800K tasks.

 GEN AI CHATBOTS: FEBRUARY 2026 APPTOPIA DATA BRIEF (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 The GenAI Chatbot app market has increased 152% year on year since
last January. ChatGPT is losing market share, but this is expected as
new capable entrants have launched. Most people have still never used
a GenAI Chatbot app. About 20% of AI users use at least two apps,
signaling that some apps are better for certain tasks than others. 

 MOST PEOPLE CAN'T VIBE CODE. HERE'S HOW WE FIX THAT (6 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Vibe coding has yet to reach mainstream consumers, remaining
primarily the domain of technical users. Companies like Poke and Wabi
are developing consumer-friendly AI products that eliminate complex
technical setup and terminology. The real opportunity lies in creating
tools that make software development accessible to non-technical
users, similar to how Squarespace and Canva democratized websites and
design.
