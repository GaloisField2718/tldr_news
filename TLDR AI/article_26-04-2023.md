HUGGINGFACE CHAT (PRODUCT) [https://hf.co/chat?utm_source=tldrai] 

Based on the 30B OpenAssistant Llama models, HuggingFace has a fun
chat application similar to ChatGPT. It is slower than competitors,
but being based on a mostly open model it still has quite some power. 

CONGRESS GETS 40 CHATGPT PLUS LICENSES TO START EXPERIMENTING WITH
GENERATIVE AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://fedscoop.com/congress-gets-40-chatgpt-plus-licenses/?utm_source=tldrai]


Congressional offices have started using OpenAI's ChatGPT to
experiment with AI technology internally. The House of
Representatives' digital service recently acquired 40 licenses for
ChatGPT Plus, distributing them among Congressional offices. The
chatbot is expected to be used for various day-to-day tasks, such as
generating constituent response drafts, summarizing speeches, drafting
policy papers or bills, and creating logos or graphical elements. This
development comes amidst ongoing debates over AI technology usage and
regulation in both the private sector and government. 

SPOTIFY CEO SAYS AI IS ‚ÄúCOOL AND SCARY‚Äù (3 MINUTE READ)

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

SELF SUPERVISED LEARNING COOKBOOK (55 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210?utm_source=tldrai] 

It could be argued that a lot of the recent success with deep learning
has come on the back of self-supervised tasks. There's not a clear
boundary between unsupervised and self-supervised, but where it does
exist this paper is a really nice exploration of the methods and all
of the various hyperparameters that need to be taken into
consideration. Self supervised learning is a really powerful technique
and this is a cool way to learn more 

FULLY SPARSE FUSION FOR 3D OBJECT DETECTION (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12310?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper investigates the integration of image modality into fully
sparse architecture for efficient long-range 3D detection, using
instance queries to fuse 2D instance segmentation with LiDAR-based 3D
segmentation. The resulting framework achieves state-of-the-art
results on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets, while being 2.7 times
faster than other multimodal 3D detection methods. 

360¬∞ RENDERING: HOSNERF UNLOCKS DYNAMIC HUMAN-OBJECT-SCENE
INTERACTIONS FROM SINGLE MONOCULAR VIDEOS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://showlab.github.io/HOSNeRF/?utm_source=tldrai] 

HOSNeRF is a 360¬∞ free-viewpoint rendering method that reconstructs
neural radiance fields for dynamic human-object-scene interactions
from a single monocular video, addressing challenges like complex
object motions and varying interactions. The method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two datasets, with a
40%-50% improvement in LPIPS, and provides compelling 360¬∞ renderings
from single videos.

TRACK ANYTHING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything?utm_source=tldrai] 

Based on segment anything and XMem, track anything is a flexible and
scalable way to track objects and videos. You can then use the masks
for automatic video editing, style transfer, or video recognition
tasks. 

SEGMENT ANYTHING IN 3D (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://jumpat.github.io/SA3D/?utm_source=tldrai] 

SA3D is a novel framework for one-shot 3D segmentation using neural
radiance fields, enabling users to segment target objects in rendered
views with minimal manual prompting. The iterative process uses 2D
masks, density-guided inverse rendering, and cross-view self-prompts
for accurate 3D mask learning, completing segmentation in about 2
minutes without optimization.

GPT-4 COST $43 MILLION TO TRAIN? (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://epochai.org/trends?utm_source=tldrai] 

While we don‚Äôt know exactly how much it cost to train the newest
flagship model from OpenAI - this report breaks down a few potential
pieces of information to try and guess how much it might have cost.
The amount is mind-blowing (it‚Äôs not a lot in absolute terms, but an
expensive model nonetheless). There are other nice tidbits in the
report around compute usage and an estimate of when we‚Äôll run out of
data!
