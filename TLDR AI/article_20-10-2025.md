 HOW TO BUILD SECURE MCP AUTH WITH OAUTH 2.1 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Securely authorizing access to an MCP server is complex. You need
PKCE, scopes, consent flows, and a way to revoke access when needed.

This guide from WorkOS [4] explains how to implement OAuth 2.1 in a
production-ready setup, with clear steps and examples. 

WorkOS Connect [5] and AuthKit [6] handle the full flow from
authorization to token management.

 GROUNDING WITH GOOGLE MAPS: NOW AVAILABLE IN THE GEMINI API (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Google Maps integration is now available in the Gemini API, enabling
developers to incorporate Maps data into geospatial-aware AI
applications. The tool enhances use cases in travel, real estate,
retail, and logistics by providing precise, location-based responses.
The tool's combination with Google Search further boosts response
quality, offering structured data and timely information. 

 APPLE EMPLOYEES HAVE 'CONCERNS' OVER SIRI PERFORMANCE IN EARLY IOS
26.4 BUILDS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple engineers testing the early iOS 26.4 build have concerns about
Siri's performance despite extended development time. Internal teams
are working on two Siri models, one using on-device models and the
other powered by Google Gemini. Concerns persist about Apple's AI
strategy, potentially leading to reliance on external solutions. 

 ALIBABA CLOUD CLAIMS TO SLASH NVIDIA GPU USE BY 82% WITH NEW POOLING
SYSTEM (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Alibaba Cloud's new Aegaeon system reduces Nvidia GPU usage by 82%,
cutting the number of GPUs needed for large AI models from 1,192 to
213. Beta tested in their model marketplace, Aegaeon addresses
resource inefficiency by pooling GPU power. This pooling allows one
GPU to serve multiple models, optimizing concurrent LLM workload
management.

 SUMMONING GHOSTS WITH ANDREJ KARPATHY (146 MINUTE VIDEO) [11] 

 In a wide-ranging conversation, Andrej Karpathy discusses AGI's
economic impact, the limits of reinforcement learning, lessons from
self-driving research, and his vision for the future of education. 

 ANDREJ KARPATHY ON AGI TIMELINES, ANIMALS VS GHOSTS, AND MORE (7
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Andrej Karpathy was recently on a podcast where he discussed AGI
timelines, Animals vs Ghosts, Reinforcement Learning, AI agents, and
job automation. Some of the explanations on the podcast were botched.
This post expands on the topics that Karpathy discussed on the podcast
to clear things up. It includes links to previous discussions Karpathy
has had on these topics. 

 AN OPINIONATED GUIDE TO USING AI (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The biggest mistake people make with paid AI subscriptions is staying
in auto mode, where the system picks weaker models instead of manually
selecting agentic modes that are far more capable and less error-prone
for real work. This guide covers practical choices like when free
models suffice versus paying $20 monthly, why prompting techniques
that worked on older models no longer matter, and why explicitly
telling AI to act as a critic is necessary to avoid talking to a
sophisticated yes-man.

 WE ARE IN THE "GENTLEMAN SCIENTIST" ERA OF AI RESEARCH (10 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Discoveries were simple in the early days of science. Many were
discovered in the course of pursuing a hobby. To win the 2026 Nobel
Prize in physics, you have to be a physicist fully immersed in the
world of physics. AI research is still very much in the 'early days of
science' category. While many papers look complicated, AI research
discoveries are often simpler than they look. Many things we learn
about AI capabilities come from informal user experimentation.
