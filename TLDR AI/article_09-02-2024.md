HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GEMINI ADVANCED AND A MOBILE APP (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google launched a new service that allows you to finally interact
with Gemini Ultra 1.0 - it will charge a monthly subscription for
access to the model. There is also a companion mobile app. 

 1X ROBOTICS DEMONSTRATION (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 1X is a robotics company that has made strides in video-to-control

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BOOSTING AI AGENTS' GAMEPLAY WITH TASK GUIDANCE (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This paper explores the development of a generalist AI agent capable
of understanding and following gameplay instructions, a step towards
"read-to-play" abilities. The researchers enhance the agent's
multitasking and generalization skills by integrating multimodal game
instructions into a decision transformer. 

 TRANSFORMER-BASED DECISION TREE (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 MetaTree is a transformer-based decision tree algorithm. It learns
from classical decision tree algorithms for better generalization
capabilities. 

 FUNSEARCH: MAKING NEW DISCOVERIES IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES USING
LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FunSearch, a new AI-powered method that combines Large Language
Models with evaluative algorithms, has made verifiable discoveries in
mathematical sciences, including solutions for the longstanding cap
set problem and more efficient algorithms for the bin-packing problem.
It introduces evolutionary approaches to generating and evaluating
code that offers human-interpretable outputs, representing a
significant leap in AI-driven scientific discovery.

 LOCAL RAG COOKBOOK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 You can build a sophisticated and powerful RAG system that runs on
your hardware using Ollama, pgvector, and local data. 

 HUGGINGFACE LIGHTEVAL LIBRARY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 HuggingFace released a lightweight evaluation library for language
model training based on HELM and Eluther AI‚Äôs evaluation harness. 

 A VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL WITH ENHANCED VISUAL REASONING (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 CogCoM, a new general vision-language model, incorporates a unique
Chain of Manipulations mechanism. This allows it to handle multi-turn
visual reasoning by actively adjusting input images.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW WE GOT FINE-TUNING MISTRAL-7B TO NOT SUCK (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 HelixML was able to better fine-tune Mistral-7B by implementing a
suite of qapair prompts that extracted content from all sorts of
different perspectives and generating a content-addressed hash for
each document. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI ADVANCED: TASTING NOTES AND IMPLICATIONS (7 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Google's newly released Gemini Advanced, a GPT-4 class AI model,
showcases capabilities equivalent to OpenAI's GPT-4. It shows
strengths in explanations and integrating images and search. 

 AN ANGEL INVESTOR COMMENTS ON AI (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This point of view, from an investor, helps to bring a little context
to the layers of value within AI right now by breaking them down into
the infrastructure layer, like cloud providers and chip makers,
modeling and core, like OpenAI and Anthropic, and AI-enhanced
products, like all of you that use AI to improve your products.
