 AI IS MAKING SPAMMERS, HACKERS, AND FRAUDSTERS MORE PRODUCTIVE. TIME
TO GET YOUR DATA OFF THE WEB (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The bad news is that threat actors are already using AI to collect
user information for robocalls, imposter calls, and other types of
fraud [4]. Real data + convincing voice impersonation can trip up
almost anyone, and deep fakes are only getting better.

The best way to protect yourself? Get your personal information OFF
data broker databases [4]. If you're too busy to send hundreds of
