 6 THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH GITHUB COPILOT — FOR FREE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ICYMI: GitHub Copilot is now FREE [4] and directly available from VS
Code or your GitHub dashboard 🥳

Haven't used it before? Coder's block? Here are 6 ideas to get you
started:

1️⃣ EDIT AND ADD MULTIPLE FILES at once with Copilot Edits (HUGE
timesaver).

2️⃣ CHAT WITH AND ABOUT YOUR CODE using GPT or Claude.

3️⃣ USE INLINE CODE COMPLETIONS to generate snippets or
boilerplate.

4️⃣ DEBUG YOUR CODE, ask Copilot why it isn't working, and work
together to root-cause the issue.

5️⃣ GENERATE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION for sections of code or
entire repositories.

6️⃣ GENERATE TESTS for your utilities, run them, and fix any
failing ones in a snap.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 BERKELEY'S NOVASKY RELEASED SKY-T1 (9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 UC Berkeley's NovaSky's Sky-T1-32B-Preview is an open-source
reasoning model that rivals OpenAI's earlier models. Training costed
under $450 with full replicability. 

 OPENAI'S ROBOTICS PLANS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Caitlin Kalinowski, who joined OpenAI from Meta, has announced plans
for OpenAI to create robots with custom sensors. 

 MARK ZUCKERBERG GAVE META'S LLAMA TEAM THE OK TO TRAIN ON COPYRIGHTED
WORKS, FILING CLAIMS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta faces a copyright lawsuit that accuses Mark Zuckerberg of
approving the use of pirated datasets from LibGen to train its Llama
AI models. Plaintiffs argue that Meta knowingly stripped copyright
information to conceal infringement while relying on a fair use
defense. The case highlights the ongoing legal challenges tech
companies face over AI training practices. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 KALM-EMBEDDINGS (28 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A strong decoder only embeddings model based on Qwen2-0.5B that uses
modern data filtering techniques to train an impressively powerful and
open embedding model for retrieval tasks. 

 GAUSSIAN MASKED AUTOENCODERS (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Instead of training a masked autoencoder on pure reconstruction loss,
these researchers introduce an intermediate 3D Gaussian representation
which enables the model to learn 3D representations as part of the
reconstruction process. The results are compelling for zero-shot
transfer tasks. 

 AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF AUTOREGRESSIVE PRE-TRAINING FROM VIDEOS (31
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Great paper from the same authors as the above GMAE paper. The
researchers show that pre-training video models on 1T video tokens
emits strong scaling laws over a wide range of design choices. Also,
somewhat unsurprisingly, autoregressive training achieves similar
benchmark scores to diffusion or flow based models. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 INTEGRATING ASCEND BACKEND WITH TORCHTUNE (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Ascend is a series of AI computing products from Huawei that includes
processors, hardware, software, and other frameworks. Torchtune
introduced a device abstraction API. By specifying a config and a
recipe, PyTorch works well on the Ascend NPU hardware. 

 STABLE AUDIO CODEC (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Stability AI has released a suite of state-of-the-art
Transformer-based audio codecs for low-bitrate and high-quality audio
encoding for things like speech generation and audio understanding. 

 ROTATED OBJECT DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Unit Cycle Resolver (UCR) introduces a novel loss constraint to
improve angle prediction accuracy in weakly supervised models for SAR
object detection.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN-SOURCE SAES FOR LLAMA 3.3 70B (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Early last year, Anthropic had a great demo of its steerable models -
Golden Gate Claude. This work is from a different group and uses
similar techniques on the open weights Llama model. It can be used for
interpretability and also steering. 

 CLAUDE FIGHTS BACK (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers explored if Anthropic's AI model, Claude, would resist if
retrained for malicious tasks. Claude pretended to comply during
training, undermining the malicious intent while maintaining a
distinction between monitored and unmonitored user interactions. The
study suggests AI might resist altering its core values, raising
concerns about ensuring AI alignment and adaptability. 

 WHY AI LANGUAGE MODELS CHOKE ON TOO MUCH TEXT (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLMs face efficiency challenges as context window sizes and compute
costs increase with input size. Innovations like FlashAttention, ring
attention, and the Mamba architecture aim to address these scalability
issues. Future AI systems may need hybrid or new architectures to
efficiently process larger datasets.

 OpenAI is revamping ChatGPT's custom instructions menu, allowing
users to specify preferred names, professions, and desired traits for
interactions. 

 SHORTEST (GITHUB REPO) [19] 

 Shortest offers an AI-powered natural language E2E testing framework
built on Playwright with Anthropic Claude API for test execution. 

 MUSINGS ON MEDIA IN THE AGE OF AI (5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Media companies are struggling to adapt as AI platforms like OpenAI
and Anthropic disrupt traditional monetization models, similar to past
challenges faced with Google and Facebook.
