 THIS AUTONOMOUS ROBOT SERVES AMERICA'S FAVORITE FOOD FASTER THAN
HUMANLY POSSIBLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 America adores ice cream. We guzzle 1.3bn gallons annually, and that
figure is only rising. The industry is currently valued at $81.8bn,
and projected to reach $114.7bn by 2030.

But ice cream is about to change forever [4] - especially the profit
margins.

Dice Cream's robot prototype [4] is a compact, fully automated
ice-cream parlor with minimal labor costs and retail estate expenses.
With a nationwide rollout in the works [4], and international
partnerships in place, Dice Cream offers 12 flavors, 144 unique
toppings combinations, and comes with a dollop of AI [4] to match each
customer with the perfect serving in seconds.

For just 15 days, you can buy shares [4] at the current valuation. Get
a scoop of the action. [4]
