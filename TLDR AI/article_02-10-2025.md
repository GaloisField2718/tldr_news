HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TINKER API BY THINKING MACHINES LAB (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Thinking Machines has launched Tinker, a flexible API for fine-tuning
open-weight language models. It abstracts infrastructure complexity,
supports large MoE models like Qwen-235B, and comes with a low-level
API and open-source Tinker Cookbook for implementing advanced
post-training techniques. 

 ANTHROPIC WORKS ON CUSTOMIZABLE SKILLS FOR CLAUDE (1 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Anthropic's 'Skills' will let users share repeatable and customizable
instructions. It appears the company is formalizing a file-based
standard for user-defined capabilities. Anthropic has yet to clarify
which types of tasks or automations will be possible. No official
launch date has been mentioned. 

 OPENAI STAFF GRAPPLES WITH THE COMPANY'S SOCIAL MEDIA PUSH (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The launch of Sora 2, a TikTok-style feed for AI-generated videos,
prompted mixed reactions from OpenAI researchers, fearful of repeating
social media's addictive patterns. Sam Altman defended the launch by
claiming that consumer revenue will fund AGI research, but many
internally and externally are skeptical that OpenAI can grow
entertainment products without compromising its nonprofit charter.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 IS A VERY GOOD MODEL (40 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic claims that Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in
the world. While there are still clear use cases where versions of
GPT-5 seem likely to be better, Claude Sonnet does seem like the best
coding model in the world right now. GPT-5 still seems to make better
use of extended thinking time than Claude Sonnet 4.5 does. Unless you
must have an open model or need to keep inference costs very low,
there is no reason to consider anything other than Claude Sonnet 4.5
or GPT-5. 

 THE MAGIC OF CLAUDE CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code is a terminal-based application that trades accessibility
for native Unix command integration. The commands that power Unix
happen to be perfectly suited for use by large language models. Having
file system access allows Claude Code to write notes to itself,
accumulate knowledge, keep running tallies, and think beyond a single
conversation. Claude Code works as a blueprint for building reliable
agentic systems because it captures model capabilities instead of
limiting them through over-engineered interfaces.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 KEEP ON-DEVICE AI SECURE - HERE'S HOW (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Running AI on your PC is transformative for productivity - but like
all emerging tech, it comes with some security risk. Learn about the
tactics attackers use to gain entry [12] to your endpoints, and how
you can stay secure. Read the eBook by Dell and Intel [12] 

 SLACK IS GIVING AI UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO YOUR WORKPLACE
CONVERSATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Slack is reshaping how AI agents access and use enterprise data with
a new platform that allows developers to tap directly into the rich
conversational data flowing through workplace channels. Its new
real-time search API and Model Context Protocol server give
third-party developers secure, permission-aware access to Slack
conversations, messages, and files. Slack is in increasingly intense
competition with Microsoft Teams. Both companies are embedding AI
throughout their collaboration platforms while taking markedly
different approaches. Slack is focused on becoming an integration hub
for other software experiences, while Microsoft is building a
comprehensive suite of productivity tools. 

 INTRODUCING TUNIX: A JAX-NATIVE LIBRARY FOR LLM POST-TRAINING (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Tunix is a JAX-native library that makes the path from pre-trained
model to a fully aligned, production-ready large language model
simpler. It gives developers a comprehensive and developer-friendly
toolkit for aligning models at scale. Tunix is built for performance
on TPUs, especially when combined with MaxText. The initial release
provides modular and easy-to-use APIs for the most common
post-training workflows. 

 DEEPMIND'S GENAI FOR DESIGN PROTOTYPING (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google DeepMind has built a custom generative image model fine-tuned
for prototyping capable of producing design outputs that reflect
specific stylistic features while enabling exploration of novel
concepts.

MISCELLANEOUS

 YOUTUBE THINKS AI IS ITS NEXT BIG BANG (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 YouTube plans to leverage AI to transform video creation, enabling
creators to use AI tools like DeepMind's Veo 3 for video enhancements.
CEO Neal Mohan highlights the potential for AI-generated content to
democratize creation, although it raises questions about authenticity.
Despite concerns, YouTube remains committed to AI advancements, aiming
to stay at the forefront of video innovation. 

 COREWEAVE SIGNS $14 BILLION AI INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL WITH META (2
MINUTE READ) [17]
