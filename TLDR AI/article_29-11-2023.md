HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MLCOMMONS ALGOPERF TRAINING BENCHMARK COMPETITION (7 MINUTE READ) [5]


 AlgoPerf is a new competition that aims to optimize for wall clock
time. This means that if you can come up with a method that beats
existing setups (e.g., faster than ADAM), you can win cash prizes.
It‚Äôs an exciting challenge backed by some of the largest AI
organizations today. 

 META AI INTRODUCES CICERO (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta‚Äôs CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level
performance in the strategy game Diplomacy. 

 STABILITY AI RELEASES SDXL TURBO (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stability AI has released a new model that can generate high
resolution images in 207ms. It doesn‚Äôt use LCM, which is what most
of the field has moved towards. Instead, it uses a novel distillation
technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation. Its weights and
code have been used for research.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 ENHANCING PRIVACY IN SIGN LANGUAGE VIDEOS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DiffSLVA is an innovative method for anonymizing sign language videos
while preserving linguistic content. This technique, which uses
pre-trained diffusion models and a specialized module for facial
expressions, overcomes previous limitations by not requiring precise
pose estimation. 

 ENHANCING DATASET DISTILLATION WITH GENERATIVE DIFFUSION TECHNIQUES
(14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new method using generative diffusion techniques has been developed
to create surrogate datasets that are more representative and diverse
while requiring significantly less computational resources. 

 ADVANCED VIDEO SUPER-RESOLUTION THROUGH DIFFUSION MODELS (14 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 StableVSR is a novel approach to video super-resolution (VSR) that
leverages Diffusion Models and a Temporal Conditioning Module to
enhance the quality of upscaled videos.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 EFFECTIVE PROMPTING LIBRARY FOR LARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[11] 

 Set of Mark prompting is a clever way to dramatically improve
vision+language model performance. This library from Roboflow gives
you similar control and makes it easier to build robust vision
pipelines with these models. It even supports open models like LLaVa. 

 TANUKI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Easily build LLM-powered apps that get cheaper and faster over time. 

 CREATING REALISTIC 3D HUMAN AVATARS FROM VIDEOS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This project proposes "Animatable Gaussians," a novel technique that
combines 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create more lifelike and
detailed human avatars from videos.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A DATA-DRIVEN LOOK AT THE RISE OF AI (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This is a slide-heavy post from the Cerebral Valley AI Summit that
takes a data approach to looking at the growth of AI. We all hear it
constantly, but the data backing it up is pretty immense. Most
interesting is the growth and subsequent collapse of developer
interest. 

 HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO USE AN LLM? (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Reviewing the details on common queries to an LLM across the
different models reveals that it is really cost-bound at the moment.
With the latest OpenAI announcements and advancements with the open
source models, that may be set to change. 

 THE 10-YEAR ‚ÄúOVERNIGHT‚Äù SUCCESS STORY OF CASETEXT (17 MINUTE
AUDIO) [16] 

 Casetext sold to Thomson Reuters for $650M in what looks like an
acquisition swept up in the AI craze. However, this was no overnight
success, with the company having started in 2023. A walk down memory
lane along with what it took to persevere.

QUICK LINKS

 OPENAI UNLIKELY TO OFFER BOARD SEAT TO MICROSOFT (2 MINUTE READ) [17]


 OpenAI is not expected to offer Microsoft and other investors seats
on its new board. 

 SPORTS ILLUSTRATED PUBLISHED ARTICLES BY AI-GENERATED AUTHORS (5
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Sports Illustrated has secretly been publishing AI-generated articles
by fake AI authors. 

 OPENAI DATA PARTNERSHIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI launched Data Partnerships to collaborate with organizations
to produce datasets to train AI models. The initiative already
includes partners like the Icelandic Government and the non-profit
Free Law Project.
