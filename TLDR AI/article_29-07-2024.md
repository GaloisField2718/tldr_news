 NVIDIA'S NEW TITAN GPU WILL BEAT THE RTX 5090, ACCORDING TO LEAK (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Rumors suggest NVIDIA may introduce a new TITAN AI graphics card
based on the Blackwell GPU. Tech leakers hint at this top-tier card's
existence, despite NVIDIA's previous decision to not release a Titan
variant for the RTX 40 series. The release and actual utility of such
a high-performance GPU, potentially 63% faster than the RTX 4090,
remain uncertain. Market dominance by the RTX 4090 may make a new
Titan superfluous.

currently utilizes the equivalent of 350,000 Nvidia A100 chip servers,
mainly for ChatGPT, with discounted rates from Azure.
