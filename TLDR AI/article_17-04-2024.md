 FRESH WEB DATA FOR LLM AND RAG APPS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you want to build AI applications with access to the web, you need
to check out the Brave Search API [4].
With a single API call, you'll get relevant search results from an
billions of webpages [4] ‚Äî high-quality, real-time data you can
build on.

You can trust the results: Brave is the fastest-growing search engine
since Bing [4], and one of the only truly independent search
providers.

Best of all, the Brave Search API is by far the least expensive option
out there. It's FREE for up to 2,000 monthly calls [4], with paid
plans that start from $5.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE IOS 18 WILL BE ON-DEVICE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's upcoming AI features in iOS 18 are rumored to focus on
privacy, with the initial set of enhancements functioning entirely
on-device without the need for an internet connection or cloud-based
processing, thanks to the company's in-house large language model
known internally as "Ajax." 

 STANFORD HAI RELEASES 2024 AI INDEX REPORT (WEBSITE) [6] 

 The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI has released its seventh
annual AI Index report. This year's report covers the rise of
multimodal foundation models, major cash investments into generative
AI, new performance benchmarks, shifting global opinions, and new
major regulations. 

 GOOGLE'S NEW TECHNIQUE GIVES LLMS INFINITE CONTEXT (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google researchers have introduced Infini-attention, a technique that
enables LLMs to work with text of infinite length while keeping memory
and compute requirements constant.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 COMPRESSION REPRESENTS INTELLIGENCE LINEARLY (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most modern AI is built around the idea of compressing a training
dataset into a model. The better the compression, the better the
model. This paper shows that relation rigorously and posits that scale
benchmark scores correlate strongly to a model's ability to compress
novel text. 

 FEEDBACK IN TRANSFORMERS (24 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TransformerFAM provides a feedback mechanism that allows Transformers
to attend to their own latent representations. This can, in theory,
introduce recurrence into the model for processing extremely long
inputs in context. 

 MEGALODON EFFICIENT TRANSFORMER PRETRAINING (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Another long context paper - this time, a new architecture that uses
two novel weight updating schemes. It outperforms Llama 2 on the same
number of training tokens 2T. It also scales to infinite context
length at inference time.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 VIRTUAL WORKSHOP: FINE-TUNE YOUR OWN LLMS TO GPT-4 LEVELS (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 The Predibase team recently launched LoRA Land, a collection of 25+
fine-tuned Mistral-7b models that rival GPT4 [11] on a set of
task-specific applications. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn
how to build your own [11] LoRA Land with popular open-source LLM
frameworks, Ludwig and LoRAX. Become a fine-tuning pro. Join the live
workshop on April 30 [11] 

 AI SYSTEM THAT CREATES DETAILED, CITED REPORTS WITH RETRIEVAL (GITHUB
REPO) [12] 

 Stanford has released a neat research system called Storm that uses
retrieval guided language models to create reports for specific
topics. 

 ROAD LINE SEGMENTATION FOR AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Accurately segmenting road lines and markings is crucial for
autonomous driving but challenging due to occlusions caused by
vehicles, shadows, and glare. The Homography Guided Fusion
(HomoFusion) module uses video frames to identify and classify
obscured road lines by leveraging a novel surface normal estimator and
a pixel-to-pixel attention mechanism. 

 ENHANCED VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Vision Language Models (vLLMs) often struggle with processing
multiple queries per image and identifying when objects are absent.
This study introduces a new query format to tackle these issues, and
incorporates semantic segmentation into the training process.

 ACCELERATING AI: HARNESSING INTEL(R) GAUDI(R) 3 WITH RAY 2.10 (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anyscale's latest release of Ray, Ray 2.10, adds support for Intel
Gaudi 3. Developers can now spin up and manage their own Ray Clusters,
provisioning Ray Core Task and Actors on a Gaudi fleet directly
through Ray Core APIs, tap into Ray Serve on Gaudi through Ray Serve
APIs for a higher level experience, and configure Intel Gaudi
accelerator infrastructure for use at the Ray Train layer. 

 QWEN CODER (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Code Qwen 1.5 is a new set of 7B models trained on 3T tokens of code
related data. It performs well on HumanEval, with a non-zero score on
SWE-bench. The chat variant specifically shows promise for long
context retrieval tasks up to 64k tokens. 

 1-BIT QUANTIZATION (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Extreme low-bit quantization for small pre-trained models, like
Llama2-7B, is challenging, but fine-tuning just 0.65% of parameters
significantly improves performance. Newly fine-tuned 1-bit models
outperform 2-bit Quip# models, while 2-bit models with specialized
data can exceed full-precision counterparts. This research suggests
that proper fine-tuning and quantization may enhance efficiency
without compromising model quality, potentially shifting focus from
training smaller models to optimizing larger, quantized ones.
