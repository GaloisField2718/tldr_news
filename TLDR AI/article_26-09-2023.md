scenes and not only identify what's in them, but also distinguish
between different instances of the same object‚Äîall by using text
descriptions.

ENHANCING DEPTH ESTIMATION WITH PASSIVE CAMERAS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://vppstereo.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This study introduces a method that simulates active stereo in passive
cameras without a physical pattern projector. By virtually overlaying
patterns using depth data from external sensors, the researchers
overcome the limitations of traditional setups. This approach enhances
both stereo algorithms and deep learning networks on various datasets.

LANGUAGE MODEL UXES IN 2027 (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://vishnumenon.com/lightrail/2023/09/17/AI-Interfaces.html?utm_source=tldrai]


This article explores what large language model-powered software might
look like in the medium-term future. LLMs are going to significantly
shift how we interact with computers. The current state of the
technology seems rudimentary and it's increasingly clear that
generative AI can't quite replace the other UX innovations that have
been introduced over the last several decades. LLM UXes will likely
evolve to have a memory of past interactions in order to provide more
relevant responses.
