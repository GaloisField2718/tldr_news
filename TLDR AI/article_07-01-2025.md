 BUILDING IN THE AGE OF AI: STARTUP LESSONS FOR EARLY-STAGE GROWTH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In an era where AI is reshaping how businesses operate, the journey
of building an early-stage startup [4] has never been more
dynamic—or complex. How do founders navigate finding product-market
fit, delegation, and scaling, all while adapting to technological
innovations?

Join on January 14 at 3 pm PT [4] for a fireside chat with Christina
Cacioppo, CEO and Co-founder of Vanta, and Eric Ries, author of The
Lean Startup and Founder of LTSE, as they explore the journey of the
modern startup founder.

Eric and Christina will discuss:

 	* Learnings from their own experiences
 	* How the principles of “founder mode” and lean methodology
intersect
 	* The ways that today's AI-driven landscape shapes early-stage
growth and startup success

MISCELLANEOUS

 EMERGING WEDGES IN VERTICAL AI STARTUPS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Vertical AI startups are rapidly gaining traction by focusing on four
key areas: voice automation, unstructured data parsing, verticalized
search, and content generation. These technologies enable startups to
address specific industry pain points, enhancing efficiency and
accessibility while reducing costs. As these companies grow, they may
evolve their offerings and potentially become essential systems of
record within their industries. 

 IS AI HITTING A WALL? (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI model pre-training improvements may be stalling, according to
experts like Ilya Sutskever, but the perception of an AI progress
plateau could be due to outdated evaluation methods. Despite scaling
challenges, AI's potential continues with untapped data sources and
synthetic data, enhancing capabilities across various domains.
Advances in teaching models reasoning and using new data could unlock
significant improvements, suggesting AI development remains robust. 

 SORRY HUMAN, YOU'RE WRONG (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ChatGPT o1 Pro, despite its hefty $200 monthly fee, shows only
marginal improvements over its predecessor. It fails key
identification tests and displays an unsettling confidence in
incorrect answers. This rigidity raises concerns about its reliability
in critical scenarios, such as insurance or health discussions. The
persistence of such behavior warrants closer evaluation and
development adjustments.
