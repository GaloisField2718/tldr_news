 BEHIND THE HYPE: HOW GENAI ACTUALLY REWIRES SEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Chatbots might be the current focus of attention — but under the
radar, genAI is completely revolutionizing search.

Algolia's new report reveals how GenAI transforms the entire search
stack [4] from content lakes and vector databases to RAG
implementations and content generation systems.

The guide explores how NeuralSearch engines now combine multiple
search types [4], why retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is becoming
essential for quality control, and how companies are rebuilding their
search infrastructure around LLM orchestration.

Also covered: breakdowns of evaluation frameworks, chunking
strategies, and the headless architecture patterns that leading teams
use to integrate genAI without breaking existing systems.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI TESTS CHATGPT AGENT UPGRADES POWERED BY NEW ALPHA MODELS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Some ChatGPT users have spotted a new 'alpha models' section in the
model selector. The models appeared for a limited time, and they
activated agent mode. The model naming - 'Agent with truncation' and
'Agent with prompt expansion' - suggests that OpenAI may be
experimenting with different system prompt setups or underlying model
architectures. The release seemed accidental and was quickly rolled
back, making model comparisons challenging. The new agent variants
appear to be aimed at early adopters, researchers, and power users
interested in tool-augmented AI workflows. 

 META'S OPEN LLM FOR CODE AND WORLD MODELING (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta has released CWM, a 32B decoder-only LLM trained on code
execution traces and reasoning tasks to explore world models in code
generation. 

 COHERE'S $7B VALUATION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cohere secured another $100 million in funding, raising its valuation
to $7 billion, and announced a strategic partnership with AMD.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 UNLOCKING A MILLION TIMES MORE DATA FOR AI (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Every major leap forward in AI progress involved a large increase in
data to support it. While AI leaders have warned that we have reached
'peak data', there is still a lot of unused data available. Most AI
systems are trained on a few hundred terabytes of data - the world has
digitized an estimated up to 200 zettabytes of data. The data exists,
but it isn't being used for training, which is an access problem
rather than a scarcity problem. The Attribution-Based Control is a
potential framework for expanding access to the world's digital data
while preserving ownership rights. It offers an approach to addressing
the technical, legal, and economic barriers that prevent access to
most of the world's data by enabling data owners to maintain control
while contributing to AI development. 

 OPENAI SHOWS US THE MONEY (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nvidia will invest as much as $100 billion in cash into OpenAI to
support new data centers. As long as OpenAI depends on Nvidia, it may
be reluctant to speak about AI risk, as it may endanger its chip
allocations. While Nvidia wants to make and sell as many chips as
possible to the widest variety of customers, OpenAI has a strong
interest in the US beating China across the board and keeping things
under control. Nvidia may do better short-term by selling to China,
but this will hurt other investments, and long-term, the model of
compute-intensive, top-quality closed models is better for it anyway. 

 HUMAN-AI SYNERGY (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Across 600 participants, researchers found that people who better
understand others' mental states performed significantly better with
AI assistance. The findings suggest that successful human-AI
collaboration depends less on technical prowess and more on social
intelligence.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 AI AMBITION IS EVERYWHERE, BUT PRODUCTION SUCCESS REMAINS ELUSIVE.
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Despite billions invested, most AI pilots never scale and the reason
is clear. Traditional monitoring tools were not designed for the
complexity, unpredictability, and autonomy of today's AI systems.

In this research [11], discover how observability closes this critical
AI production gap. From monitoring hallucinations and tracing decision
paths to ensuring compliance and cost optimization, observability
gives enterprises the visibility and control needed to deliver
trustworthy AI outcomes at scale.

 CROSS-AGENT PRIVILEGE ESCALATION: WHEN AGENTS FREE EACH OTHER (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cross-Agent Privilege Escalation is when multiple coding agents
operating on the same system are tricked into modifying each other's
configurations to escalate their privileges. While some agents now
lock down the ability to modify their own settings, this doesn't work
when multiple agents are run in the same environment. The possibility
of the exploit highlights the need for better isolation strategies and
stronger secure defaults in agent tooling. Developers should get into
the habit of running these agents in locked-down containers. 

 INTRODUCING THE DATA COMMONS MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) SERVER:
STREAMLINING PUBLIC DATA ACCESS FOR AI DEVELOPERS (5 MINUTE READ) [13]


 The Data Commons Model Context Protocol Server makes all the Data
Commons' vast and interconnected public datasets instantly accessible
and actionable for AI developers, data scientists, and organizations
worldwide. It allows developers to use real-world statistical
information to help reduce large language model hallucinations. The
server enables agents to handle the full range of data-driven queries,
from initial discovery to generative reports. It is designed for
seamless integration into agent development workflows. 

 CLOUDFLARE VIBE SDK (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Cloudflare Vibe SDK is an open-source full-stack AI webapp
generator. It deploys an AI-powered platform that allows users to
specify what they want to build in natural language, and the AI
creates and deploys that application. The SDK is perfect for companies
that build AI-powered platforms, internal development, and SaaS
platforms. Built on Cloudflare's platform, the Cloudflare Vibe SDK
utilizes the full Cloudflare developer ecosystem. A full guide on how
to set it up is available. 

 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ON PRETRAINING DATA (16 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 RLPT introduces a new training paradigm where language models use
reinforcement learning directly on pretraining data, removing the need
for human-annotated rewards.

 META POACHES OPENAI SCIENTIST TO HELP LEAD AI LAB (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Mark Zuckerberg has poached Yang Song, a high-ranking researcher from
OpenAI, to be the lead research principal of Meta Superintelligence
Labs. Song had been at OpenAI since 2022, where his research focused
on improving models' ability to process large, complex datasets across
different modalities. He developed a breakthrough technique that
helped inform the development of the DALL-E 2 image generation model
while still a graduate student at Stanford University. 

 NEON, THE NO. 2 SOCIAL APP ON THE APPLE APP STORE, PAYS USERS TO
RECORD THEIR PHONE CALLS AND SELLS DATA TO AI FIRMS (9 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Neon Mobile pays users for their audio conversations, selling the
data to AI companies. It pays 30 cents per minute when users call
other Neon users and up to $30 per day maximum for making calls to
anyone else. Only Neon users are recorded during these calls. The app
also pays for referrals. The app's privacy policy includes a very
broad license to its user data that leaves plenty more room for the
company to do with users' data than it claims. While the app raises
many red flags, it may be technically legal.
