 LANGCHAIN WORKS GREAT... UNTIL YOUR AGENT BECOMES PART OF A REAL
PRODUCTION SYSTEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Agent A finished, Agent B is waiting, Agent C failed halfway through,
and you have no idea what state your system is in. Building agents
truly is just the tip of the iceberg.

In enterprise environments, your LangChain agent is almost never the
whole story. This Orkes technical guide [4] shows how to coordinate
your agents, services and systems in durable, observable workflows.

👉 Instead of stitching everything together with custom glue code,
you get production fundamentals built in: stateful execution, retries,
parallel steps, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and full visibility
into every run. 

The walkthrough [4] includes a real example with four cooperating
agents, along with a public GitHub repo you can clone and run
yourself.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI INTRODUCED PRISM (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's Prism is a free collaborative scientific writing platform
powered by GPT-5.2. It integrates LaTeX-native writing, revision, and
publishing workflows in one workspace, aiming to streamline and
accelerate research. 

 KIMI K2.5 (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kimi K2.5 is a multimodal model capable of visual reasoning, code
generation from UI and video inputs, and agentic task orchestration
using a swarm-based architecture. It's built on 15T vision-language
tokens through continual pretraining. 

 A SEAMLESS NEW SEARCH EXPERIENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google Search now features Gemini 3 as the default AI model for
enhanced AI Overviews, enabling users to find detailed answers
quickly. Users can seamlessly engage in follow-up conversations with
AI Mode directly from these overviews for more in-depth inquiries.
These upgrades aim to provide a fluid search experience, combining
quick snapshots with the option for deeper exploration. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 1TB MODEL ON A SINGLE H200 (31 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An INT4 quantization-aware training pipeline that enables rollout of
~1TB-scale models on a single H200 GPU. By combining fake quantization
during training with real quantization at inference, it achieves
BF16-level stability and opens a path to cost-efficient,
high-performance deployment. 

 DEEPSOUGHT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The "DeepSeek Moment" predicted to trigger an AI Winter turned out to
be minor, with NVIDIA's stock quickly recovering from an initial 17%
drop. DeepSeek influenced a shift towards cheap, open-source AI
models, particularly benefiting China. The upcoming 'V4' model from
DeepSeek could further impact the balance in AI advancements,
especially with the US and China navigating tensions over NVIDIA chip
sales. 

 MONETIZING AI SURFACES: ADS IN THE AGE OF AI (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI is planning to take two approaches to monetizing its free
tier: classic intent-based ad formats and affiliate fees on native
checkout. Long term, the Ads opportunity for the company is massive
and could even be a Google, Meta, or TikTok scale opportunity. A shift
to advertising to agents could change the fundamental nature of what
ads look like. The winning ads will probably work less to persuade
humans and look more like offers that make the user better off.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 ARE CONTEXT GRAPHS REALLY THE NEXT $1T IDEA IN AI? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Context graphs aren't retrieval systems; they're production world
models. They allow you to ask "what breaks if I merge this PR?" so you
can fix defects _before_ they hit production. PlayerZero [12] builds
these production world models so your AI actually understands how
systems behave.

 KIMI AGENT SDK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Kimi Agent SDK is a set of multi-language libraries that expose
the Kimi Code agent runtime in applications. It can be used to build
products, automations, and custom tooling. The SDK clients reuse the
same Kimi CLI configuration, tools, and MCP servers to stream
responses in real-time, surface approvals and tool calls, and let
users orchestrate sessions programmatically. Go, Node.js, and Python
are supported. 

 DEEPSEEK-OCR 2 (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 DeepSeek-OCR 2 is a significant upgrade to DeepSeek-OCR. It maintains
high visual token compression while achieving meaningful performance
improvements. The model is powered by DeepEncoder V2, which implicitly
distills causal understanding of the visual world through the
integration of both bidirectional and causal attention mechanisms.
This leads to causal reasoning capabilities in the vision encoder and
marked lifts in visual reading logic. 

 AI2 RELEASED OPEN CODING AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI2 released open-source coding agents and a training recipe that
makes it affordable and practical to build coding agents for private
or internal codebases. Its method reproduces top-tier performance at
drastically lower compute costs compared to previous approaches. 

 META'S SELF-CURRICULUM (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SOAR is a self-improvement framework that uses meta-RL to help
pretrained models learn from problems they initially fail at. By
grounding synthetic problem generation in student model progress, it
enables learning on sparse-reward tasks without requiring correct
solutions upfront. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE LAUNCHES AGENTIC VISION IN GEMINI 3 FLASH (1 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Google has introduced Agentic Vision in Gemini 3 Flash. The new
capability enables the model to effectively use code and reasoning to
improve performance for common vision tasks. It is available to users
through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, and within the
Gemini app. Google plans to extend Agentic Vision's reach by
supporting more model sizes and integrating additional tools like web
and reverse image search. 

 SOFTBANK IN TALKS TO INVEST UP TO $30 BILLION MORE IN OPENAI (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 SoftBank is in talks to invest up to $30 billion more into OpenAI.
OpenAI is seeking up to $100 billion in new capital in a round that
could value it as much as $830 billion. It needs substantial funding
to continue developing its AI models, pay for its vast computing
needs, and retain top researchers in an increasingly competitive
market. The company is aiming to raise capital from Middle Eastern
sovereign-wealth funds and other venture capital funds.
