HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COREWEAVE RAISES $1.1B (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Coreweave is a GPU provider that rents out super clusters. This
recent funding brings them to a $19B valuation. 

 HOW FIELD AI IS CONQUERING UNSTRUCTURED AUTONOMY (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Field AI, founded by former NASA JPL leader Ali Agha, specializes in
autonomous robots that operate in unstructured environments without
needing maps, GPS, or human supervision. Using advanced AI models
developed from DARPA challenges, the company's robots can adapt to new
and changing conditions, significantly enhancing their utility in
industrial and construction settings. 

 AMAZON Q, A GENERATIVE AI-POWERED ASSISTANT FOR BUSINESSES AND
DEVELOPERS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AWS has launched Amazon Q, a generative AI assistant aimed at
improving software development and decision-making by leveraging a
company's internal data. Amazon Q facilitates coding, testing, and app
development for developers, while offering data-driven support for
business users through natural language interaction. The service also
includes Amazon Q Apps, enabling the creation of custom AI
applications without coding expertise.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPDIVE: A TRANSFORMER WALK-THROUGH, WITH GEMMA (36 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Understanding the Transformer is an endeavor that often takes several
tries. This blog post walks through the Gemma architecture and
explains everything in detail. It is clear and has code and figures. 

 KAN: KOLMOGOROV-ARNOLD NETWORKS (60 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Multi-Layer Perceptrons are used widely in AI today, including in the
Transformer between Attention layers. However, they use fixed
activation functions. This paper suggests using learned activation
functions on edges using the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation
(functions can be represented by a superposition of simpler
functions). In this case, the researchers replace weights with
splines. The architecture is much more complicated, but has some
interesting properties that potentially make it more interpretable. 

 REKA VIBE-EVAL (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reka trains large foundation models and has quickly caught up to some
of the best players despite having a fraction of the funding. It has
released a subset of its internal evaluation suite, which it uses to
determine how strong its models are.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED LANGUAGE MODELS: A SURVEY (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 This survey paper delves into the world of Retrieval-Augmented
Language Models (RALMs), highlighting their evolution, structure, and
diverse applications in NLP tasks such as translation and dialogue
systems. 

 3D RENDERING WITH MEMORY-EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Lightplane Renderer and Splatter components is a new method that
dramatically reduces memory usage in 2D-3D mappings. The Lightplane
Renderer skillfully generates images from neural 3D fields, while the
Lightplane Splatter efficiently projects these images into 3D Hash
structures. 

 CLIP PRETRAINED MAMBA MODELS (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The new Mamba model, trained using contrastive language-image
pretraining (CLIP), shows impressive efficiency and performance in
zero-shot image classification.

MISCELLANEOUS

 3D GENERATION WITH THE MICRODREAMER ALGORITHM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Researchers have developed an innovative 3D generation algorithm,
dubbed MicroDreamer, which significantly accelerates the process by
reducing the number of function evaluations required. 

 GPT-2? (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A mysterious AI model named gpt2-chatbot, displaying capabilities
akin to GPT-4.5, has emerged on lmsys.org, prompting speculation of it
being an unofficial OpenAI test for their next iteration. Key
identifiers such as response quality, OpenAI-specific traits, and rate
limits suggest a high level of sophistication, potentially hinting at
a discreet benchmarking initiative by OpenAI. Investigations and
discussions around gpt2-chatbot's origins and capabilities are ongoing
in the AI community. 

 A.I. START-UPS FACE A ROUGH FINANCIAL REALITY CHECK (6 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 High-profile AI startups like Inflection AI, Stability AI, and
Anthropic are facing financial pressures as they struggle with the
high costs of developing generative AI models. While OpenAI, backed by
Microsoft, has shown revenue growth, competitors like Anthropic and
Stability AI grapple with substantial gaps between revenue and
operating expenses. Microsoft's investment in AI hints at the tech
industry's belief in AI's long-term profitability, despite the current
challenges in monetizing these expensive technologies.
