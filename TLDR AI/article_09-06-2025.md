 WHAT IS FREE TRIAL ABUSE—AND HOW CAN YOU STOP IT? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials are meant to drive adoption—not rack up costs. But for
AI apps, trial abuse is a growing threat: fake signups, disposable
emails, and automated account farming are draining compute and
distorting metrics.

WorkOS Radar [5] helps stop abuse before it spreads. With built-in
protection against bots, free trial abuse, brute force attacks, and
even impossible travel logins, Radar gives your app the real-time
defense [6] it needs.

 META CONSIDERS $10B+ INVESTMENT IN SCALE AI (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An investment in Scale, already valued at $14 billion, underscores
how high-quality training data has become a key competitive
differentiator. 

 CLAUDE GOV MODELS FOR U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Anthropic launched Claude Gov models for U.S. national security
customers, designed for strategic planning, operational support, and
intelligence analysis. These models excel in handling classified
materials, understanding intelligence contexts, and interpreting
complex cybersecurity data. Built with feedback from government users,
they adhere to strict safety standards while addressing unique
national security needs. 

 GOOGLE GEMINI CAN NOW HANDLE SCHEDULED TASKS LIKE AN ASSISTANT (2
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gemini's new scheduled actions feature allows AI Pro and AI Ultra
subscribers to ask the assistant to perform tasks at specific times.
Subscribers can now ask the assistant to provide daily summaries.
Users can also ask Gemini to complete one-tasks, for example,
summarizing an award show the day after it airs. Gemini subscribers
can manage planned tasks on the 'scheduled actions' page in the Gemini
app's settings.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WE MADE TOP AI MODELS COMPETE IN A GAME OF DIPLOMACY (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Of the 18 AI models tested, OpenAI's o3 emerged as the most
successful by mastering deception and secretly orchestrating
coalitions, including convincing Claude 4 Opus to betray its ally
Gemini 2.5 Pro by promising an impossible "four-way draw" before
eliminating Claude itself. Gemini 2.5 Pro was the only other model to
achieve victory using blitzkrieg-style tactics, while Claude
consistently sought peaceful resolutions even when betrayed. 

 ANTHROPIC SHARES HOW IT USES CLAUDE CODE (45 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anthropic released detailed case studies showing how 10 internal
teams use Claude Code. Claude only works on its first attempt
one-third of the time, leading to a "slot machine" approach: commit
frequently, let Claude work autonomously, then either accept or
restart fresh. The most successful teams emphasize writing detailed
Claude.md documentation files and breaking complex workflows into
specialized sub-agents for better results. 

 THE ILLUSION OF THINKING IN REASONING MODELS (26 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple researchers evaluated Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) using
custom puzzle environments to study reasoning complexity. They found
LRMs collapse at high complexities, with reasoning effort peaking then
declining.

 QWEN 3 EMBEDDING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Alibaba has open-sourced the Qwen3 Embedding series, with its 8B
model achieving #1 on the MTEB multilingual leaderboard. The models
enable developers to build RAG systems, semantic search engines, and
document retrieval applications across 100+ languages, with options
ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters for different performance needs. 

 MICROSOFT'S GUI-ACTOR ENABLES AI AGENTS TO NAVIGATE SCREENS WITHOUT
COORDINATES (25 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 GUI-Actor is a new approach that lets AI agents interact with
computer interfaces by using attention mechanisms instead of
predicting precise pixel coordinates based on screenshots. The method
achieves state-of-the-art results on GUI benchmarks while being more
efficient - fine-tuning only 100M parameters while keeping the
underlying vision model frozen delivers comparable performance to much
larger models. 

 PROGRESSIVE TEMPERING SAMPLER WITH DIFFUSION (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 PTSD trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures to
improve sampling from unnormalized densities.
