 THIS TECH COMPANY GREW 32,481%... (SPONSOR) [4] 

 No, it's not Nvidia… It's MODE MOBILE, 2023's fastest-growing
software company according to Deloitte.

Just as Uber turned vehicles into income-generating assets, Mode is
TURNING SMARTPHONES INTO THE EASIEST PASSIVE INCOME SOURCE [4],
already helping 45M+ users earn $325M+ through simple, everyday use. 

The technology behind it all is the _EarnPhone_, and it could be the
biggest disruption to smartphones since the iPhone.

Mode has recently secured their Nasdaq stock ticker $MODE, but you can
still invest in their pre-IPO offering at just $0.26/share [4]. They
are over 95% towards their $20M February INVESTMENT GOAL, with limited
space left in the offering.

generation model called SANA-sprint. This model is shockingly fast at
generating images while still maintaining quality. The team uses a
novel distillation method that builds on consistency distillation. An
open problem in this domain is to ensure these consistency models are
still easy to fine-tune.

 PATHS AND WAYSTATIONS IN AI SAFETY (16 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This essay outlines a framework for addressing the AI alignment
problem by distinguishing between the technical parameters ("problem
profile") and civilization's ability to respond ("competence
profile"). Key to this approach are three "security factors": safety
progress, risk evaluation, and capability restraint. The essay sets up
a discussion on using future AI labor to enhance these factors and
explores various strategic milestones for improving AI safety.
