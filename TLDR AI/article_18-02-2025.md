HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL SABA (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mistral Saba is a 24B parameter model trained on meticulously curated
datasets from across the Middle East and South Asia. The model
provides more accurate and relevant responses than models that are
over 5 times its size while being significantly faster and lower cost.


 SOUTH KOREA BANS DEEPSEEK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 South Korea has temporarily banned new downloads of China's DeepSeek
AI chatbot due to data protection concerns. The app, which gained over
a million users in a week, will remain unavailable until compliance
improvements are made. 

 FAL RAISES $49M SERIES B TO POWER THE FUTURE OF AI VIDEO (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 fal has secured $49M in Series B funding led by Notable Capital and
joined by a16z and others, totaling $72M in funding to date. The
company is focused on expanding its platform for AI-driven generative
media, especially video content, catering to industries like
advertising and gaming. fal's proprietary technology promises fast,
scalable, and reliable deployments, which has already attracted
enterprise clients such as Quora and Canva.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LARGE DIFFUSION LANGUAGE MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Large scale training of a diffusion model for language that matches
LLaMA 3 8B in performance across many benchmarks. 

 EVALUATING LLMS WITHOUT HUMAN JUDGMENT (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers introduce a benchmark that assesses LLM open-ended text
generation using n-gram statistics and rules, avoiding reliance on
human or LLM-based judgments. It closely correlates with GPT-4o
evaluations while being computationally efficient. 

 SPEEDING UP LLM INFERENCE WITH COPYSPEC (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CopySpec is a method that accelerates LLM inference by identifying
and copying repeated sequences in chat history without extra GPU
memory usage. It achieves up to 3.08x speed-up on specific tasks and
integrates effectively with speculative decoding for additional gains.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 STEP AUDIO CHAT (HUGGING FACE HUB) [10] 

 This is the Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) component of
Step-Audio. It is a 130-billion-parameter multimodal LLM that is
responsible for understanding and generating human speech. The model
is specifically designed to seamlessly integrate functions such as
speech recognition, semantic understanding, dialogue management, voice
cloning, and speech generation. 

 MEASURING LLMS MEMORY (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This study explores the limitations of existing methods for
evaluating the memory capacity of language models. It introduces the
"forgetting curve," a new approach for assessing how well models
retain information over long contexts. 

 INDOOR NAVIGATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 AdaSimulator provides a physics-enabled environment for studying
Visual Language Navigation (VLN) in realistic settings. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 US' FIRST MAJOR AI COPYRIGHT RULING (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A U.S. judge ruled that Ross Intelligence infringed on Thomson
Reuters' copyright by using Westlaw headnotes to train its AI. The
decision may influence other AI-related copyright lawsuits but remains
narrowly focused on non-generative AI applications. 

 RED HAT'S TAKE ON OPEN-SOURCE AI: PRAGMATISM OVER UTOPIAN DREAMS (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Red Hat emphasizes a pragmatic approach to open-source AI, focusing
on practical enterprise needs rather than chasing AGI. Challenges
include reconciling transparency with competitive realities,
especially regarding open-source AI's opacity in training data and
model weights. Red Hat aims to foster collaboration, avoiding vendor
lock-in, while acknowledging the complexities of AI compared to
traditional open-source software. 

 THE EU AI ACT IS COMING TO AMERICA (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Although federal leadership seems wary of heavy AI regulations, many
US states are implementing legislation modeled on Europe's AI Act.
This article outlines how “algorithmic discrimination” laws,
inspired by EU rules, could create detailed impact assessments,
require compliance paperwork, and impose liability on AI
deployments—raising the real prospect of higher operating costs for
teams building AI systems.

California State University for personalized tutoring and
administrative tasks. 

 TINDER WILL TRY AI-POWERED MATCHING AS THE DATING APP CONTINUES TO
LOSE USERS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Tinder plans to counter declining user engagement by introducing
AI-driven features for discovery and matching. 

 GOOGLE IS ADDING DIGITAL WATERMARKS TO IMAGES EDITED WITH MAGIC
EDITOR AI (2 MINUTE READ) [19]
