HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMD'S NEW LANGUAGE MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AMD used the OLMO codebase to train and release a language model
trained on its accelerators. 

 OASIS BY ETCHED & DECART (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Etched and Decart's Oasis is an AI model that generates open-world
games frame-by-frame from user inputs, showcasing advanced physical
understanding and real-time interaction. Oasis uses a Diffusion
Transformer architecture optimized for the upcoming Sohu chip,
enabling large-scale, low-latency 4K video models. The model, which
integrates custom hardware for improved performance at scale,
represents a shift towards interactive AI-generated content. 

 OPENAI WILL START USING AMD CHIPS AND COULD MAKE ITS OWN AI HARDWARE
IN 2026 (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is collaborating with Broadcom and TSMC to develop custom AI
chips which are expected to begin production by 2026. Meanwhile,
OpenAI is integrating AMD's MI300 chips into its Microsoft Azure
infrastructure. Despite aligning with other tech giants on custom chip
strategies, OpenAI remains behind Google, Microsoft, and Amazon in
hardware development.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT CAMERA POSE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NoPoSplat is a feed-forward model that can reconstruct 3D scenes from
sparse, multi-view images without needing accurate camera poses. 

 IMPROVING LANGUAGE MODELS' REASONING (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study tackles a unique challenge in LLMs: how well they handle
reasoning prompts that contain irrelevant or incorrect rationale
snippets. 

 LONG-CONTEXT EVALUATION IN LANGUAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This study identifies a key flaw in using perplexity (PPL) to
evaluate LLMs' long-context capabilities - PPL averages across all
tokens and misses crucial ones needed for understanding extended
inputs. To improve this, the authors introduce LongPPL, a metric that
highlights these essential tokens for a clearer measure of
long-context performance.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SCALE AUTOMATED WEB TESTING WITHOUT SCALING HEADCOUNT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 QA Wolf (4.8 ⭐ on G2) [11] brings AI-level scale and efficiency to
testing, with unlimited parallel test runs on their cloud
infrastructure and a zero-flake guarantee.

80% automated test coverage [11] in just 4 months. Trusted by Cohere,
Autotrader, Salesloft and many others.

 FAST VS. SLOW THINKING IN LANGUAGE MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project explores how different "thinking" approaches — fast
(concise) versus slow (detailed, like chain-of-thought reasoning) —
impact layer-wise gradients and stability in LLMs. 

 3D OBJECT DETECTION USING ONLY 2D IMAGES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ImOV3D is a framework that advances open-vocabulary 3D object
detection (OV-3Det) by leveraging 2D images to overcome the scarcity
of 3D annotations. 

 REALISTIC MOTION IN TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 DEMO is a framework that separates text and conditioning into content
and motion components. By using distinct encoders and conditioning for
static content and dynamic motion, DEMO better interprets and
generates motion from text prompts.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PROJECT SID (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Project Sid shows civilizational progress, specialization,
governance, and the invention and spread of memes and religion. These
were made possible by Altera's new cognitive architecture: PIANO. 

 WE'RE FORKING FLUTTER. THIS IS WHY (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's corporate focus shift to AI has deprioritized Flutter's
desktop platforms, creating a labor shortage for this once rapidly
expanding UI toolkit. In response, a fork named Flock is being
developed to include essential bug fixes and features the Flutter team
can't tackle, aiming to accelerate Flutter's growth through community
involvement. Flock plans to improve contribution processes and
streamline PR reviews, bridging the gap in support and development
pace left by the main Flutter team. 

 USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND $4.80 OF GPU TIME TO FIND THE BEST
HN POST EVER (RLHF PART 1) (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This article discusses using reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) to develop a reward model that predicts upvote counts
for Hacker News stories. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset and $4.80
of GPU time, the reward model was trained on features like titles,
authors, and content to optimize for post quality, with the ultimate
goal of utilizing RLHF techniques to enhance the creation of
high-value content. The resulting model, while not perfect, can
successfully identify underappreciated stories and predict potential
front-page hits.
