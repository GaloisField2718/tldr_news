 A TECHNICAL GUIDE TO BUILDING AGENTIC SYSTEMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The next evolution in AI isn't better chat, it's agents that can
actually do things: query databases, update systems, and make
decisions. But connecting AI to every tool means custom code for each
integration.

Algolia's new whitepaper [4] breaks it down — in great detail but
with zero BS:

 	* How agentic AI works
 	* What model context protocol (MCP) enables
 	* How to build agents that can search indices, pull analytics, and
modify configurations through natural language
 	* Real ecommerce use cases
 	* Examples of Python implementations

 SAM ALTMAN ON OPENAI'S REVENUE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sam Altman revealed OpenAI's annual revenue run rate surpassed $20B,
with future infrastructure commitments reaching $1.4 trillion. Plans
include enterprise offerings, AI cloud services, and ventures into
consumer devices and scientific discovery. 

 OPENAI READIES GPT-5.1 THINKING MODEL AHEAD OF GEMINI 3 PRO (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 GPT-5.1 Thinking has been spotted in a backend component responsible
for powering advanced reasoning processes within ChatGPT, indicating a
GPT-5.1 release is close. Rumors point to a lineup of three models
(Mini, Thinking, and a possible Codex-focused upgrade), each designed
to fit different user needs and compute constraints. OpenAI is likely
aiming to synchronize the release with Google's upcoming Gemini 3 Pro
launch. 

 $350B (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google plans to invest even more money into Anthropic. It is now in
talks for a new funding round that could value Anthropic at $350
billion. The new deal could involve Google providing additional cloud
computing services to Anthropic, a convertible note, or a priced
funding round early next year. Google last month announced that it had
inked a deal worth tens of billions for Anthropic to access Google's
AI compute.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 FORECASTS OF AI & ECONOMIC GROWTH (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most economists forecast 0.1-1.5% annual excess growth through 2035,
while AI insiders predict 3-30%. Most economists, though, assume that
today's ChatGPT is essentially the ceiling of AI progress and that
visions of a virtual AI coworker won't really materialize, but how is
it possible that cheap, PhD-level intelligence wouldn't boost
productivity? The forecasts imply that either AGI will be far less
general than claimed or that adoption will be dramatically slower than
historical technology diffusion. AI's 2024 economic footprint appears
to be around 0.5% of GDP. 

 5 THOUGHTS ON KIMI K2 THINKING (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Kimi K2 Thinking, a reasoning MoE model developed by China's Moonshot
AI team, shows just how many people are learning quickly to train
excellent AI models. Early reports note a distinctive style and
writing quality - the model is beating leading closed models on some
benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam and BrowseComp. It is the
closest open models have been to the closed frontier of performance
ever.

 KIMI K2 THINKING (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Chinese lab Moonshot AI released an open-source reasoning model that
matches or exceeds GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 on some benchmarks,
including a 44.9% on Humanity's Last Exam and 71.3% on SWE-Bench
Verified. 

 GEMINI FILE SEARCH TOOL (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google introduced File Search, a built-in RAG system for the Gemini
API that simplifies retrieval tasks. It includes vector search,
automatic citations, and broad file format support with free storage
and on-demand embedding. 

 ACCUMULATING CONTEXT CHANGES THE BELIEFS OF LANGUAGE MODELS (32
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Extended conversations can reshape how AI models answer the same
question. After 10 rounds of debate about moral dilemmas, GPT-5
reversed its position 54.7% of the time when asked again. When models
changed their stated beliefs, they also chose different tools to
accomplish tasks.

 LEAVING META AND PYTORCH (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Soumith Chintala has left Meta after working at the company for 11
years. Chintala spent almost eight years leading PyTorch, taking it
from nothing to more than 90% adoption in AI. He plans to move to
something small and new. PyTorch has been left in capable hands, and
Chintala is confident that its values will stay intact, but things may
change in flavor because he will no longer impose his own taste from
the top. 

 GOOGLE DEPLOYS NEW AXION CPUS AND SEVENTH-GEN IRONWOOD TPU —
TRAINING AND INFERENCING PODS BEAT NVIDIA GB300 AND SHAPE 'AI
HYPERCOMPUTER' MODEL (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google Cloud has introduced new AI-oriented instances powered by its
own Axion CPUs and Ironwood TPUs. The new instances are aimed at both
training and low-latency inference. Servers running these chips come
equipped with Google's custom Titanium-branded controllers, which
offload network, security, and I/O storage processing, enabling better
management and higher performance. More details about Google's
in-house designed processors are available in the article.
