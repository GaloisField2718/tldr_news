 CODY, SOURCEGRAPH‚ÄôS CONTEXT-AWARE CODING ASSISTANT, IS NOW GA. CODE
MORE, TYPE LESS (SPONSOR) [6] 

 Cody is your new favorite teammate, using its deep understanding [6]
of your codebase to explain, fix, and help you write code.
Sourcegraph‚Äôs code graph [6] allows Cody to autocomplete, explain,
and edit your code with much richer context [6].

Combined with AI-powered chat, Cody removes blockers when taking on
tricky problems or jumping into unfamiliar code [6], answering
questions like ‚ÄúHow is this repository structured?‚Äù or even
generating unit tests and documentation for you.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPMIND‚ÄôS AI UNCOVERS NOVEL MATHEMATICS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DeepMind published a paper in Nature about FunSearch, which uses
LLM-guided function search to find solutions to open problems in
mathematics and computer science. It tackled the capset problem and
discovered some of the largest capsets to date. 

 OPENAI SUPERALIGNMENT GRANTS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is distributing a number of grants for students and
researchers hoping to work on super alignment. Applications are due
Feb 18th. 

 FAST AI FOUNDER LAUNCHES NEW FOR PROFIT RESEARCH LAB (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Answer AI is a new lab that isn‚Äôt aiming to build new models, but
instead trying to figure out truly productive and valuable uses for
existing models. It aims to do fundamental research for organizations
to help them unlock AI-enabled use cases.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 WEAK TO STRONG GENERALIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This new result from the OpenAI super alignment team (with code)
suggests that you can use much weaker supervisor models to steer or
align a far more powerful model, an analog to weak humans aligning
super intelligent models. They used GPT-2 to recover much of the
alignment performance of GPT-4. One important point they note is that
this method has a tractable path for dramatic improvement, unlike
RLHF-like methods. 

 BETTER 3D SCENE UNDERSTANDING WITH LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A new research approach introduces object identifiers in Large
Language Models to improve understanding and answer questions about 3D
scenes. This method, which focuses on identifying and relating objects
in a scene, has shown promising results in making AI more adept at
interpreting complex spatial relationships. 

 SWITCHHEAD: A MORE EFFICIENT TRANSFORMER MODEL (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SwitchHead is a breakthrough in making AI models more efficient. It
reduces the memory and computing needs of Transformers without losing
performance.

Monitoring [13] 

 ROADMAP TO LEARN GENERATIVE AI IN 2024 (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A work-in-progress repository to help get up to speed on the latest
innovations. It is mostly geared towards beginners and includes
resources for learning Python, deep learning, and language modeling. 

 A SMART WAY TO IMPROVE HDR IMAGES (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 The study introduces LLF-LUT, a technique that enhances the quality
of HDR photos by focusing on important image details. 

 NEW MULTIMODAL MODEL FROM NOUS RESEARCH (HUGGING FACE HUB) [16] 

 Capybara is a new base model for language and Obsidian is the
multimodal extension. It has 3B parameters and can run on edge devices
like phones.

 WHY STABILITY AI IS LAUNCHING A SUBSCRIPTION FEE (6 MINUTE READ) [17]


 The race in AI is already starting to be littered with those that
didn‚Äôt execute well. Stability AI feels like it is grasping at
straws to be relevant amid an ever changing roadmap and vision. Open
source one day, and not the next. It‚Äôs a sure way to lose everything
when you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. 

 HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE OPENAI Q* RUMORS (21 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Q* is unlikely to be the crucial breakthrough that leads to
artificial general intelligence, but it might be an important step
toward an AI with general reasoning abilities.
