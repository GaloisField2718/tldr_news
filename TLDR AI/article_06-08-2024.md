 AI IS MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SPAMMERS, HACKERS, AND FRAUDSTERS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Research by Incogni [4] reveals that imposter calls (impersonating a
person, agency, or company) were a major problem in 2023.

AI makes it easier for bad actors to aggregate user information for
robocalls, imposter calls, and other types of fraud [4]. Deep fake
technology is bound to make this worse.

 ELON MUSK SUES OPENAI, SAM ALTMAN FOR MAKING A ‚ÄúFOOL‚Äù OUT OF HIM
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Elon Musk has revived a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO Sam
Altman, accusing them of fraudulently obtaining $44 million in seed
funding by promising to keep OpenAI's technology open-source and
prioritize the public good, only to later turn it into a for-profit
venture with ties to Microsoft, which Musk claims betrays the original
mission and has caused irreparable harm to both his interests and the
public. 

 TRIO OF OPENAI FOUNDERS LEAVE THE COMPANY (4 MINUTE READ) [7]

of conversation. CRM integration included. Start free [11] 

 BOOSTING EFFICIENCY IN VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 This project introduces a method to balance computational loads
during large-scale 3D parallel training of vision-language models,
addressing the imbalance caused by differing data distributions and
model architectures. 

 TEXGEN (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 High quality generation of textures on 3d models with diffusion. 

 BYU ENGINEERING RESEARCH FINDS KEY TO QUICKER NUCLEAR POWER:
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 BYU chemical engineering professor Matt Memmott has developed an AI
algorithm that could reduce the nuclear reactor design and licensing
process by a decade, cutting costs significantly. His team's research
shows AI can optimize complex nuclear design problems much faster than
traditional methods, with one example reducing design time from six
months to just two days. The findings aim to accelerate nuclear power
production to meet rising energy demands and maintain affordable power
costs.

 YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA JUST HOW MUCH PEOPLE HATE GENERATIVE AI (5
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This blog explores the dichotomy of love and hate for AI, emphasizing
its pivotal role in progress while also acknowledging the distrust and
dissatisfaction people have with Big Tech. Disdain for generative AI
stems from its perceived shortcomings and the high-cost, low-return
reality emphasized by tech leaders' actions. Ultimately, the
misaligned efforts of technologists risk a widespread aversion to AI,
well beyond generative models, threatening the potential of beneficial
AI applications.
