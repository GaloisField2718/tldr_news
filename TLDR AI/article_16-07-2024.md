 THE MANAGED-SERVICE-AS-SOFTWARE (M-SAS) STARTUP POWERED BY AI (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 There is an emerging paradigm of Managed-Service-as-Software (M-SaS)
startups, where AI-driven service-oriented startups build their
companies according to a new business model blueprint. This requires a
fundamental shift in mindset for startups to use AI, rather than to
sell AI. Initially labor-intensive with low gross margins, these

 COULD AIS BECOME CONSCIOUS? RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE NO WAY TO TELL (15
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The debate over AI potentially achieving consciousness is
intensifying, with contrasting views on whether advancements in
machine learning and neuromorphic computing can lead to sentient
machines. Integrated Information Theory suggests AI consciousness is
unlikely due to current hardware limitations, whereas computational
functionalist theories like Attention Schema Theory and Global
Neuronal Workspace Theory consider it inevitable. Neuroscience seeks a
unified theory of consciousness to better understand its potential
emergence in AI.
