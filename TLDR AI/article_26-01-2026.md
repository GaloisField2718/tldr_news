 STOP READING TRANSCRIPTS. START LISTENING WITH ELMS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Voice is multi-dimensional. Tone and timing can change the meaning of
a conversation and transcript-reliant LLMs miss it all.

So meet Ensemble Listening Models [5](ELMs), a new AI architecture
built by Modulate, that orchestrates 100+ voice-specific models to
better understand conversations. Modulate's ELM, Velma [4], is now
publicly available so you can harness human-level, real-time voice
intelligence.

4 benefits of using Velma:

 	* Decode intent, emotion, stress, and authenticity in messy,
multilingual audio.
 	* 100x faster, cheaper, and more accurate than LLMs.
 	* Traceable outputs with an explainable path. No black box, just
evidence you can trust.
 	* Placed #1 on benchmarks for contextual understanding.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE WILL REPORTEDLY UNVEIL ITS GEMINI-POWERED SIRI ASSISTANT IN
FEBRUARY (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple plans to unveil a Gemini-powered Siri assistant in February,
leveraging Google's AI models to enhance task completion using user
data. An even more advanced version that offers more conversational
capabilities akin to ChatGPT will be revealed at the Worldwide
Developers Conference in June. This development marks a shift in
Apple's AI strategy following key leadership changes and its
partnership with Google. 

 OPENAI TO ADD SHOPPING CART AND MERCHANT TOOLS TO CHATGPT (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is adding a dedicated shopping cart section to ChatGPT. It
will serve as a centralized space for reviewing selected items and
finalizing purchases. The company is also adding support for personal
responses in temporary chat sessions to balance privacy with
customized assistance. There is no clear timeline for public
availability of these features. 

🧠 

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 UNROLLING THE CODEX AGENT LOOP (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Codex CLI is a cross-platform local software agent designed to
produce high-quality, reliable software changes while operating safely
and efficiently on users' machines. This is the first part in a series
of posts that explores how Codex works. It focuses on the agent loop,
which is the core logic responsible for orchestrating the interaction
between the user, the model, and the tools the model invokes to
perform work. The post provides a view into the role the Codex harness
plays in making use of a large language model. 

 LESSONS FROM BUILDING AI AGENTS FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES (23 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Building AI agents for financial services requires rigorous technical
infrastructure and data normalization to avoid costly errors. Key
insights include the essentiality of sandbox environments for secure
multi-step workflows and the transformation of raw financial data into
structured, searchable context through markdown and metadata. Skills
systems, using markdown instead of code, allow dynamic, user-specific
instructions for models, which is crucial as AI models rapidly improve
and reduce the need for complex scaffolding.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 SERPAPI: FEED LIVE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS TO YOUR AI (SPONSOR) [10]

 CHALLENGES AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE
HARDWARE (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Large language model inference is hard. The primary challenges are
memory and interconnect rather than compute. This paper highlights
four architecture research opportunities: High Bandwidth Flash for 10X
memory capacity with HBM-like bandwidth, Processing-Near-Memory and 3D
memory-logic stacking for high memory bandwidth, and low-latency
interconnect to speedup communication. The paper focuses on datacenter
AI, but it also reviews the architectures' applicability for mobile
devices. 

 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AT TEST TIME (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TTT-Discover applies reinforcement learning during inference,
allowing LLMs to adapt to each task on the fly. It sets new
performance benchmarks across math, biology, algorithms, and GPU
kernels. 

 DIFFUSION-BASED CODE MODELING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Stable-DiffCoder introduces block diffusion continual pretraining for
code LLMs, showing performance gains over autoregressive models across
several programming benchmarks, especially for editing, reasoning, and
low-resource languages.

 THE DUELLING RHETORIC AT THE AI FRONTIER (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 One CEO of a frontier AI lab might say AI will replace all software
engineers within the next few months, while another will say that
current AI systems are nowhere near human-level intelligence. Neither
is probably lying, they're just making statements that benefit their
businesses. AI executives aren't neural experts. The truth is usually
somewhere in the middle. 

 I SPENT 40 HOURS RESEARCHING CLAWDBOT. HERE'S EVERYTHING THEY'RE NOT
TELLING YOU (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Clawdbot is an autonomous AI agent that runs locally and can execute
real actions, not just generate text. Some features work immediately
out of the box, like file management, basic research, and document
processing, while advanced automations require hours or days of setup.
