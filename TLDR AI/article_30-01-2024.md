HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META RELEASES CODELLAMA 70B MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta's new models have been fine-tuned and instruction-tuned on
significantly more code. They achieve impressive performance on
HumanEval, approaching GPT-4 in some respects. The models are
available under the Meta license and on HuggingFace 

 RWKV LAUNCHES EAGLE 7B (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 RWKV is an architecture alternative to the dominant Transformer
model. It uses a novel linear attention mechanism that makes it
extremely efficient. This new checkpoint and configuration was trained
on 1T tokens and surpases many other powerful 7B Transformer based
models. 

 ITALIAN DPA TELLS OPENAI CHATGPT IS VIOLATING EUROPE‚ÄôS PRIVACY LAWS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is suspected of violating European Union privacy laws. Italy's
data protection authority has given it 30 days to respond to
allegations following an investigation into ChatGPT.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LARGE-VOCABULARY 3D DIFFUSION MODEL WITH TRANSFORMERS (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 One key challenge with 3D object generation is the diversity of items
that can be created. This work uses a modified architecture to improve
sample efficiency and scales up the system to work with a much larger
set of objects in each 3D category. 

 SLICEGPT (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Another potential distillation work. Importantly, this one can work
on models as small as Phi-2. This means you can remove 90% of the rows
and columns of weight matrices with minimal reduction to quality at
almost all scales. 

 LEARNING UNIVERSAL PREDICTORS (33 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meta Learning is the process of training systems that learn to learn
and can quickly adapt to new tasks. This work from Google improves
Meta Learning with synthetic data generated from a Universal Turing
Machine and analyzes the results experimentally and theoretically.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 POWER BI ON MICROSOFT FABRIC: MARKETING OR A REAL SEMANTIC LAYER
SOLUTION? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Microsoft is marketing its Fabric Lakehouse architecture as an ideal
way to manage Power BI semantic models. This tech talk [12] will
examine these claims in light of AtScale‚Äôs TPC-DS benchmark [12],
measuring Power BI performance on Microsoft Fabric on 100GB, 1TB and
10TB of data. Tune in for the results ‚Üó [12] 

 TRANSFORMING ARTISTIC IMAGE EDITING WITH AI (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 CreativeSynth is a method for artistic image editing by seamlessly
integrating text and image inputs. Its diffusion model, equipped with
customized attention mechanisms, enables precise style and content
manipulation while preserving the original artwork's essence. 

 IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH INCONSISTENCY MASKS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Inconsistency Masks (IM) are a new method for image segmentation that
works even with limited data. This approach, tested on the ISIC 2018
dataset, beats traditional techniques and even outperforms models
trained on fully labeled datasets. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 BIOMETRIC SECURITY WITH IMAGE DISTORTION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A new image distortion technique makes facial images unrecognizable
to humans but still identifiable by AI, striking a balance between
privacy and accuracy in biometric systems. 

 ENHANCING HAND IMAGE GENERATION IN AI MODELS (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers have improved the ability of generative models like GANs
and diffusion models to create realistic hand images by adding three
extra channels to training images for hand annotations.
