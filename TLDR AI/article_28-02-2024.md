HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE CANCELS SELF-DRIVING CAR PROJECT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 After a decade of effort and billions of dollars, Apple is canceling
its unsuccessful attempt at building a car to rival Tesla. Many of the
employees are expected to move to generative AI projects. 

 BERKELEY FUNCTION CALLING LEADERBOARD (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Function calling is when a language model can access tools via
synthesized functions to complete its given instructions. This
requires proper synthesis of arguments to pass to those functions.
This leaderboard is designed to assess model capability on function
calling tasks.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CHATMUSICIAN (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Music understanding typically relies on adding a modality-specific
encoder to a language model. This is expensive and unstable. This work
found that music understanding increased substantially without impact
to base language ability when music was tokenized into ABC notation. 

 MEGASCALE (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Bytedance has produced a system called MegaScale that can be used to
train massively parallel large language models. It succeeded in
training a 175B LLM on 12,288 GPUs with 55.2% Model FLOPs Utilization
(MFU), which is extremely impressive. Bytedance plans to open source
some aspects of the codebase. 

 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL WITH ADVANCED RERANKING (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ListT5 introduces a cutting-edge reranking method that not only
improves the precision of information retrieval but also offers an
efficient solution to the challenges faced by previous listwise
rerankers.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 3D OBJECT DETECTION IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 EMIFF is an innovative camera-based 3D detection framework for
vehicle-infrastructure cooperative object detection. It uses
Multi-scale Cross Attention and Camera-aware Channel Masking to
correct pose errors from camera asynchrony. 

 MERGING THE BEST OF MULTIPLE LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 FuseChat introduces an innovative way to blend the strengths of
various large language models into a single, more powerful model
without the high costs of training from scratch. 

 SAFE LLMS WITH SHIELDLM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ShieldLM is a safety detector for large language models that aligns
with human safety standards, offers customizable detection, and
explains its decisions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TEN AI INSIGHTS FROM DATABRICKS, ANYSCALE, AND MICROSOFT (11 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 This article reports on interviews with founders from companies at
the forefront of AI, covering their views on the advent of AGI, how to
think about LLMs, and simple tactics for founders on how to approach
AI within their products. 

 MOBILLAMA (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 MobiLlama is a fully open-source, transparent, small language model
for use on mobile devices. Its performance is excellent for a small
0.5B parameter model - it even outperforms some larger models. 

 QUANTIZED LANGUAGE MODELS FOR EFFICIENCY (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 IR-QLoRA is a new approach that enhances the accuracy of quantized
large language models, making them more suitable for use on devices
with limited resources.
