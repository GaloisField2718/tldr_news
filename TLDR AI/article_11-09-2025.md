 WHAT'S STOPPING YOUR ENTERPRISE FROM DEPLOYING AI AGENTS? (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Security?

Integrations?

Orchestration?

If you've tried bringing agentic AI to a large enterprise, these are
questions you needed to answer - and most simple workflow builders
have no good answers.

That's where Airia comes in. It's the AI security and orchestration
platform that's built for enterprise [4].

That means security and compliance [4] are cornerstones, not
afterthoughts. It means they've thought of how this thing actually
integrates with your legacy systems. And it means you'll get actual
onboarding and a thriving support community.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI AND ORACLE REPORTEDLY INK HISTORIC CLOUD COMPUTING DEAL (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI reportedly signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute
power over five years, starting in 2027, marking one of the largest
cloud contracts ever. This move diversifies OpenAI's cloud providers
beyond Microsoft Azure, aligning with its involvement in the $500
billion Stargate Project for domestic data centers. Oracle has been
working with OpenAI since 2024, highlighting a strategic shift in
cloud resources essential for OpenAI's growth. 

 REPLIT RAISES $250M AT $3B VALUATION, LAUNCHES AGENT 3 (4 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The AI coding platform grew annualized revenue from $2.8 million to
$150 million in less than a year, driven by 40 million users who can
now build apps without coding experience. Agent 3 can work
autonomously for up to 200 minutes compared to Agent 1's 2-minute
limit, testing and fixing its own code while building applications
with minimal human interaction. 

 BYTEDANCE UNVEILS NEW AI IMAGE MODEL TO RIVAL GOOGLE DEEPMIND'S
‘NANO BANANA' (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ByteDance's Seedream 4.0 is an AI image model that the company claims
is superior to Google DeepMind's "Nano Banana" in prompt adherence,
alignment, and aesthetics. The model combines features from previous
versions at the same cost of US$30 per 1,000 generations. These claims
are based on ByteDance's internal MagicBench benchmark but lack an
official technical report.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 NONDETERMINISM IN LLM INFERENCE (38 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LLM inference remains nondeterministic even under greedy decoding due
to floating-point non-associativity and concurrent execution. 

 HOW TO USE COMPUTING POWER FASTER: ON THE WEIRD ECONOMICS OF
SEMICONDUCTORS AND GENAI (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 It's difficult to understand how model providers will manage to
generate sufficient usage, as the adoption rate is far from sufficient
to absorb the computing power that will eventually be brought to
market. The semiconductor industry will have to enter a downward cycle
at some point, and this will hurt the AI sector significantly. The
lack of interest in the economics of semiconductors is a real weakness
in the analysis of the development of generative AI. This article
shares economic considerations on the subject to help readers better
understand these contemporary issues. 

 A GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING AI AS NORMAL TECHNOLOGY (27 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 What if AI follows predictable patterns of adoption instead of the
rapid superintelligence takeoff many in Silicon Valley prophesy? The
impacts of AI depend on how it's adopted, not raw capabilities alone.
Many industries continue to use outdated technology due to the
non-technical (for example, Air Traffic control uses the same system
from the 50s). Even advanced AI features available today have an
adoption problem. ChatGPT's "thinking" models are used by less than 1%
of users nearly a year after release.

 GET INSIGHTS FROM SLACK'S 2025 WORKFORCE INDEX (SPONSOR) [11] 

 AI at work is growing fast — Slack's latest Workforce Lab report
shows daily use up 233% in six months [11], driving 64% higher
productivity and 81% greater job satisfaction. Join Slack's webinar
[11] to dig into the data and learn practical ways to use AI for
smarter insights, faster workflows, and less busywork. 

 CLAUDE API: WEB FETCH TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The new web fetch tool in the Claude API fetches content from URLs as
part of its response to prompts. It can extract full text content from
URLs and PDFs. For security, the tool can only fetch URLs that have
previously appeared in the conversation context, so it cannot fetch
arbitrary URLs that Claude generates or URLs from container-based
server tools. Anthropic recommends only using the tool in trusted
environments or when handling non-sensitive data, as enabling it poses
data exfiltration risks. 

 MINI-O3: OPEN SOURCE AGENTIC VISUAL REASONING (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Mini-o3 is an open-source model designed for agentic visual
reasoning. It supports multi-turn interactions similar to OpenAI's o3,
and scaling to tens of rounds. The full training pipeline is public.

 AI AS TELEPORTATION (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 While AI has the potential to improve our lives in a lot of ways, it
is important to be wary of secondary effects and unintended
consequences of the technology. For example, vibe coding really speeds
up iteration loops and helps developers explore more ideas, but it
removes previous design processes, which can change things in ways
that are hard to predict. Sometimes the friction and inconvenience is
where the good stuff happens, so be very careful about removing it. 

 I RAN CLAUDE IN A LOOP FOR THREE MONTHS, AND IT CREATED A GEN Z
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CALLED CURSED (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Claude autonomously developed a programming language where "slay"
means function, "sus" means variable, and pointers are represented by
the Among Us character. The "cursed" language compiles to actual
binaries and includes editor extensions.

 JUDGE PUTS ANTHROPIC'S $1.5 BILLION BOOK PIRACY SETTLEMENT ON HOLD (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A federal judge paused Anthropic's $1.5 billion book piracy
settlement, citing concerns about the terms that give authors $3,000
per allegedly pirated book. 

 WE'VE (FINALLY) ADDED FULL SUPPORT FOR MCP TOOLS IN CHATGPT (1 MINUTE

 CLAUDE WEB APP MAY SOON ADD MEMORY SYNTHESIS AND INCOGNITO MODE (1
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Leaked code strings suggest Claude will soon automatically
incorporate information from past conversations without being
explicitly asked and will support an “incognito mode” that would
prevent chats from being saved, added to memory, or used for model
training. 

 GEMINI BATCH API NOW SUPPORTS EMBEDDINGS AND OPENAI COMPATIBILITY (2

 The Gemini Batch API now supports the newly launched Gemini Embedding
model and the ability to leverage the OpenAI SDK to submit and process
batches.
