$1M AI SECURITY GRANT (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/openai-cybersecurity-grant-program?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI is launching a grant program to support cyber security
professionals using AI and combating AI enabled systems. They are
accepting applications and have a number of ideas to show the types of
projects they're looking to support. 

BAIDU ROLLS OUT AI VENTURE FUND (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/31/as-part-of-ai-push-chinese-tech-giant-baidu-is-now-rolling-out-an-ai-venture-fund/?utm_source=tldrai]

Chinese tech giant Baidu is rolling out a 1 billion yuan ($145
million) AI venture fund to back startups focused on content generated
by artificial intelligence applications. The fund will also launch a
competition for developers who build applications off Baidu's ERNIE
large language model (LLM) or integrate the model into their existing
products. 

USING GOOGLE‚ÄôS CODE HISTORY TO WRITE MORE CODE (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/05/large-sequence-models-for-software.html?utm_source=tldrai]

Google has recorded every change to its code base for decades,
including rich descriptions, changes, and fixes. They treat this as a
sequence modeling problem and create a set of robust internal tools
that can help software engineers be more productive. They find it to
be surprisingly effective, even at novel tasks like ‚Äúhistory
informed generation‚Äù.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

INTRIGUING PROPERTIES OF QUANTIZATION AT SCALE (28 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19268?utm_source=tldrai]

We‚Äôve talked about precision before, that‚Äôs how much space it
takes to store a number. And how many unique values that number can
represent. When you reduce the precision, AI models take less space on
the computer, but weird things start to happen because you represent
fewer numbers for the parameters. This paper studies what happens when
you quantize before training at scale. They start to poke at the
magical 6B parameter performance barrier. 

GENEFACE++: GENERALIZED AND STABLE REAL-TIME AUDIO-DRIVEN 3D TALKING
FACE GENERATION (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00787?utm_source=tldrai]

Creating realistic talking digital people that sync with any speech
audio is an important challenge in the digital world. GeneFace++ is a
new method that improves lip-syncing, video quality, and system
efficiency, making it the first of its kind to achieve real-time
talking face generation. 

COST-EFFICIENT FINE-TUNING OF COMPACT MODELS (17 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01645?utm_source=tldrai]

Large AI models can be expensive and bad for the environment, so
researchers have found a more efficient way to create smaller models
using a method called knowledge distillation. This approach is often
better than spending money on extra data and helps create compact
models that still perform well in various language tasks.

AUTONOMOUS DRIVING WITH MULTI-CAMERA UNIFIED PRE-TRAINING (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/chaytonmin/occ-bev?utm_source=tldrai]

This research introduces 'Occ-BEV', a new pre-training method for
autonomous driving that focuses on making better use of multiple
camera views, rather than just one, thus capturing a more accurate
understanding of the surrounding environment. The technique uses a
unique 3D decoder to predict the 3D geometry of the environment. 

GPT4TOOLS: CONTROLLING VISUAL FOUNDATION MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/stevengrove/gpt4tools?utm_source=tldrai]

The new GPT4Tools system can manage multiple visual foundation models
by analyzing language content, allowing it to automatically decide,
control, and use different models based on the user's needs during a
conversation. Uniquely, it enables users to teach their own language
model how to use tools more effectively using a simple
self-instruction and LoRA approach, making conversations about
image-related tasks much smoother and more efficient. 

SMARTGPT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Cormanz/smartgpt?utm_source=tldrai]

A program that provides LLMs with the ability to complete complex
tasks using plugins.

SPEEDING UP THE MPT 65K CONTEXT MODEL (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/emozilla/mpt-7b-storywriter-fast?utm_source=tldrai]

The recent MosaicML MPT models are still gaining popularity. One of
the big contributions was the ‚ÄúStorywriter‚Äù model which could use
up to 65k tokens in context. Inference with this model was painfully
slow. By adding a Key/Value cache we can speed up generation by almost
10x. 

AUTOMATE THE CEOS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/automate-the-ceos?utm_source=tldrai]

Hamilton Nolan argues that CEOs are becoming increasingly unnecessary
as AI becomes more sophisticated. He proposes that we should automate
the CEO position and distribute the power and wealth that CEOs
currently control to other stakeholders, such as workers and
shareholders.

[https://archive.ph/bffdw?utm_source=tldrai]

TikTok accounts are posting horrifying artificial
intelligence-generated clips of murder victims ‚Äî mostly children ‚Äî
describing their own ghastly demise.
