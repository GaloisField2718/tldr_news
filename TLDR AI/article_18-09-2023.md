HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

ADOBE‚ÄôS FIREFLY GENERATIVE AI MODELS ARE NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE,
GET PRICING PLANS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/adobes-firefly-generative-ai-models-are-now-generally-available-get-pricing-plans/?utm_source=tldrai]

Adobe's Firefly generative AI models, previously in beta, are now
available in Creative Cloud, Adobe Express, and Adobe Experience
Cloud. Users will be charged via "generative credits" based on model
interaction. Paid Adobe plans come with various credit amounts.
Firefly will still work (but run slower) once credits run out. 

MUSK WARNS SENATORS ABOUT AI THREAT, WHILE GATES SAYS THE TECHNOLOGY
COULD TARGET WORLD HUNGER (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/2iNEH?utm_source=tldrai]

Industry heavyweights like Musk, Gates, and Zuckerberg debated AI
regulation in a private session, discussing concerns about open-source
misuse and job threats. A consensus emerged on the need for government
oversight. 

IBM THROWS HAT IN LANGUAGE MODEL ARENA WITH OPEN SOURCE MOE MODELS (3
MINUTE READ) [https://github.com/IBM/ModuleFormer?utm_source=tldrai]

Mixture-of-Experts models are sparse models, which means they save on
computation while not sacrificing accuracy. They're tricky to train.
IBM has released several along with their architecture and some code.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY ON AI COPYRIGHT ISSUES (90 MINUTE READ)
[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4523551&utm_source=tldrai]

This recently updated work dives into the many angles of AI copyright.
AI copyright can broadly be classified into Input and Output legal
challenges. The paper doesn‚Äôt present any opinions - it is merely a
summary of many of the common issues. 

MAKING ONE AUDIO MODEL WORK FOR SPEECH, MUSIC, AND SOUNDS (4 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07391v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have developed a method called EncodecMAE that borrows
ideas from text-based models to make a universal audio model. This new
approach works well for different kinds of audio tasks like
understanding speech, identifying music, or recognizing sounds in the
environment. 

A GAME-CHANGER IN REMOTE SENSING RESEARCH WITH SYNTHETIC DATA (16
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01907v1?utm_source=tldrai]

SyntheWorld is a groundbreaking collection of fake but super-detailed
images that help researchers study the Earth from above without the
usual big costs and headaches. With 40,000 images, it's perfect for
learning how land changes over time.

MULTIVIEW SYNTHETIC GETS A BOOST (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/liuyuan-pal/SyncDreamer?utm_source=tldrai]

Recent improvements in the field of 3D generation have been
blistering. This work is the most stable and general. You can input an
image and the model will synthesize many views and a resulting 3D
model. 

MAKING AI 'COPILOTS' EVEN BETTER AT FIXING CODE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ise-uiuc/Repilot?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers have created Repilot, a system that makes AI copilots
better at helping programmers fix bugs in their code. 

USING TRANSFORMERS FOR BETTER SLEEP ANALYSIS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/mathieuseraphim/spdtransnet?utm_source=tldrai]

Transformers are smart algorithms usually used for text or images.
This project tweaked them to work with EEG data to better understand
sleep stages.
