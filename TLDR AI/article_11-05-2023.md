HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

HUGGINGFACE AGENTS (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/transformers_agents?utm_source=tldrai]


Agents are language models that can use tools. These tools are digital
like calculators or other AI models. HuggingFace has an interface that
allows you to use agents easily and quickly. They provide a curated
set of models that work well for many tasks. The recent release of
Starcoder also improves the usability of agents pretty dramatically. 

GOOGLE RELEASES MUSICLM (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/10/google-makes-its-text-to-music-ai-public/?utm_source=tldrai]


Google today released MusicLM, a new experimental AI tool that can
turn text descriptions into music. Available in the AI Test Kitchen
app on the web, Android or iOS, MusicLM lets users type in a prompt
like ‚Äúsoulful jazz for a dinner party‚Äù or ‚Äúcreate an industrial
techno sound that is hypnotic‚Äù and have the tool create several
versions of the song. 

GOOGLE'S AI CHATBOT BARD GETS MULTILINGUAL WITH NEW UPGRADES (6 MINUTE
READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23718066/google-bard-ai-features-waitlist-dark-mode-visual-search-io?utm_source=tldrai]


Google is boosting the abilities of its AI chatbot Bard with added
features such as multi-language support, Google Docs and Gmail
integration, and visual search, while also making it globally
available. Bard, now upgraded to Google's new PaLM 2 language model,
will offer improved responses, better coding assistance including
debugging, and the ability to generate visuals using AI in the future,
keeping it competitive with rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and
Microsoft's Bing chatbot.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

ENHANCING LANGUAGE MODELS WITH ALGORITHMS FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE (13
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05364?utm_source=tldrai] 

Recent research shows that incorporating algorithms into large
pre-trained language models (LLMs) can significantly improve their
capabilities, without the need for fine-tuning. An example of
evidence-supported question-answering demonstrates a 6.4% improvement
over the standard baseline, suggesting the potential advantages of
this innovative, cost-effective method. 

BUILDING AFFORDABLE BUSINESSES WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (5 MINUTE
READ)
[https://info.deeplearning.ai/battlefield-chat-protecting-artists-styles-openai-retools-for-business-language-models-for-science-search?utm_source=tldrai]


This batch of deeplearning.ai newsletter examines how using large
language models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, can be a cost-effective
solution for automating tasks or generating content. It highlights
that LLMs can generate enough text to engage a user for an hour for as
low as $0.08, making them significantly cheaper than human labor for
many tasks, and that the cost-effectiveness improves further when the
generated content is consumed by a large audience. 

EXPLORING THE POWER AND POTENTIAL OF DATA AUGMENTATION WITH DIFFUSION
MODELS (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10253?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper systematically evaluates methods for generating images from
diffusion models and their benefits for data augmentation in
downstream tasks. The study reveals that personalizing diffusion
models towards target data is effective, but using the training data
of the diffusion model alone through a simple nearest neighbor
retrieval procedure results in stronger downstream performance,
highlighting the potential and limitations of diffusion models in data
augmentation.

PRE-TRAINING WITHOUT ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/jxiw/BiGS?utm_source=tldrai] 

Attention is a way for a language model to perform computation over
words. It is pretty expensive. What if we could use 1d convolution
state space models for BERT training? It turns out to perform quite
well, all the code, weights, etc is available here in Jax. 

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT-HUB (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub?utm_source=tldrai] 

Chain-Of-Thought-Hub benchmarks large language models' complex
reasoning ability with chain-of-thought prompting. 

LLM CHAIN (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/sobelio/llm-chain?utm_source=tldrai] 

LLM Chain is a powerful rust crate for building chains in large
language models allowing you to summarize text and complete complex
tasks.

THE LEVERAGE OF LLMS FOR INDIVIDUALS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://mazzzystar.github.io/2023/05/10/LLM-for-individual/?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses the potential of LLM (Large Language Model)
technology for individual users. The author explores various use
cases, such as aiding in creative writing, generating code, and
answering questions on various topics. The article also addresses
potential drawbacks, including concerns about AI-generated
misinformation, ethical issues, and the accessibility of LLM
technology for personal use due to its resource-intensive nature. 

THE AI TAKEOVER OF GOOGLE SEARCH STARTS NOW (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717120/google-search-ai-results-generated-experience-io?utm_source=tldrai]


The article focuses on Google's plan to improve search results using
AI-generated experiences. Google is working on integrating AI into its
search engine to create more personalized and relevant search results
for users. This approach aims to provide users with a richer and more
interactive experience, including features like AI-generated images,
videos, and text. However, the article also highlights potential
challenges, such as maintaining user privacy and addressing biases in
AI-generated content.
