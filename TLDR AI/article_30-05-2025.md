 BASETEN LAUNCHES MODEL APIS AND TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT FOR
PRODUCTION AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 MODEL APIS

Baseten just launched Model APIs, on-demand frontier models including
DeepSeek V3, R1, Llama Maverick and Scout, purpose-built for
production workloads on their optimized Inference Stack. Try them out
[4]. 

📈Top of the OpenRouter leaderboard [5] in latency and throughput.

🛠️Support tool calling and structured outputs out of the box,
ideal for agents.

🤝Fully OpenAI-compatible, so Model APIs can be used as drop-in
replacements. 

🧪More pre-optimized models are added regularly.

TRAINING

Because one product launch isn't enough, Baseten also released
Training (Beta). Built for power users, Training provides the
infrastructure to fine-tune without limits using any model or dataset.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 PERPLEXITY LABS (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Perplexity has introduced Perplexity Labs, allowing Pro users to go
from idea to execution by generating reports, spreadsheets,
dashboards, and simple apps using tools like web browsing and code
execution. 

 FLUX.1 KONTEXT FOR IN-CONTEXT IMAGE GENERATION (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Black Forest Labs released FLUX.1 Kontext, a set of flow-matching
models that enable text-and-image-based in-context image editing and
generation. 

 ANTHROPIC OPEN-SOURCES CIRCUIT TRACING TOOLS FOR AI INTERPRETABILITY
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The tools generate "attribution graphs" to trace how large language
models make decisions internally, revealing the step-by-step reasoning
process behind outputs. The library works with popular open-weight
models and includes an interactive Neuronpedia frontend for exploring
model circuits.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 DEEPSEEK'S R1 LEAPS OVER XAI, META, AND ANTHROPIC TO BE TIED AS THE
WORLD'S #2 AI LAB AND THE UNDISPUTED OPEN-WEIGHTS LEADER (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 DeepSeek R1 0528 has jumped from 60 to 68 in the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index. This positions the model as higher intelligence
than xAI's Grok 3 mini, Nvidia's Llama Nemotron Ultra, Meta's Llama 4
Maverick, and Alibaba's Qwen 3 253, and equal to Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. The model has increased intelligence across the board from
previous generations without any changes to its architecture. The gap
between open and closed models is now smaller than ever. 

 FORMER OPENAI SAFETY RESEARCHER EXPLAINS AI REASONING REVOLUTION (40
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Lilian Weng published a comprehensive technical survey connecting
test-time compute to human psychology, drawing on Kahneman's "fast vs
slow thinking" to explain why models perform better when given extra
computational steps before answering. The review covers the science
behind chain-of-thought, the RL approaches powering o1 and R1, and the
alignment risks posed by reward hacking.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 CHATTERBOX TEXT-TO-SPEECH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Resemble AI released an open-source TTS model that outperforms
ElevenLabs in benchmarks and features emotion exaggeration controls. 

 GLOBAL ILLUMINATION WITH RENDERFORMER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 RenderFormer is a neural renderer that produces photorealistic images
directly from triangle-based scene representations with full global
illumination. It doesn't require any per-scene training or
fine-tuning. 

 WEB BENCH - A NEW WAY TO COMPARE AI BROWSER AGENTS (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Web Bench is a new dataset for evaluating web browsing agents. It
consists of 5,750 tasks on 452 different websites. Anthropic Sonnet
3.7 CUA is currently state-of-the-art according to Web Bench. 

 CHEAPER VLM TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Meta researchers introduced a method called zero-shot grafting, which
trains a vision encoder with a smaller surrogate model derived from a
large LLM's shallow layers. This reduces VLM training costs by ~45%
while preserving or even improving performance when transferred to the
full LLM.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A RECENT CLARITY THAT I GAINED IS VIEWING AI RESEARCH AS A
“MAX-PERFORMANCE DOMAIN” (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 'Max-performance domains' are industries where people can be
world-class by being very good at only one part of their job. It
doesn't matter if you're incompetent at adjacent skills as long as you
can create seminal impact. Exceptional ability at a single thing
outweighs incompetence at other parts of the job. It is a luxury to
work in a max-performance domain as failure is allowed and stress is
usually self-imposed. 

 1000X INCREASE IN AI DEMAND (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 NVIDIA reports notable growth with a shift from simple AI to more
complex reasoning, driving a massive increase in AI demand.
Hyperscalers are deploying nearly 72,000 GPUs weekly, with Microsoft
alone seeing a fivefold increase in token generation. Increased demand
requires more data centers, termed "AI factories," despite efforts to
reduce model sizes.

 GOOGLE RELEASES MEDGEMMA MEDICAL AI MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 MedGemma is an open-source model built on Gemma 3 that comes in 4B
multimodal and 27B text-only variants. 

 HUGGING FACE UNVEILS TWO FULLY OPEN-SOURCE HUMANOID ROBOTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [19]

has announced HopeJR, a full-size humanoid, and Reachy Mini, a desktop
robot for testing AI applications. 

 DELAWARE SCRUTINIZES OPENAI'S FOR-PROFIT SHIFT (2 MINUTE READ) [20]
