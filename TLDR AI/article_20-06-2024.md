HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ILYA SUTSKEVER IS STARTING A NEW AI COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ilya Sutskever has launched Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI), a
startup focused solely on developing a safe and powerful AI system
free from the commercial pressures faced by companies like OpenAI. 

 APPLE'S INTELLIGENT STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple's WWDC revelations highlight its strategic positioning in AI
with a focus on privacy and security and employing in-house chips and
a zero-trust architecture in its Private Cloud. Apple's AI integrates
OpenAI's ChatGPT for tasks beyond its scope, with a business model
where AI suppliers may financially contribute to access Apple's user
base. Apple's approach to privacy could leverage upcoming regulations
as a competitive advantage, aligning with its commitment to user
privacy and potentially reinforcing its dominance in tech. 

 ROBLOX'S ROAD TO 4D GENERATIVE AI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Roblox is building toward 4D generative AI, going beyond single 3D
objects to dynamic interactions. Solving the challenge of 4D will
require multimodal understanding across appearance, shape, physics,
and scripts. Early tools that are foundational for its 4D system are
already accelerating creation on the platform.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MICROSOFT'S FLORENCE-2 STATE-OF-THE-ART VISION MODEL (HUGGING FACE
HUB) [7] 

 Microsoft has released an MIT-licensed set of small VLMs that
dramatically outperform much larger models on captioning, bounding,
and classification. 

 LOGIT PRISMS: DECOMPOSING TRANSFORMER OUTPUTS FOR MECHANISTIC
INTERPRETABILITY (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The logit lens method, which helps in understanding transformer
models' decision-making, has been enhanced by breaking down logit
outputs into contributions from various model components. This
approach, which uses "prisms" for residual streams, attention layers,
and MLP layers, reveals how these parts influence predictions and
provides insights into tasks like factual retrieval and arithmetic
performed by the gemma-2b model. 

 LLMS AS DECISION MAKERS (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Decision QA is a new task for LLMs that determines the best decisions
based on complex data analysis.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 üÜï ATSCALE DEVELOPER EDITION IS NOW GA ‚Äî AND IT'S FREE FOR UP TO
500 QUERIES/MO (SPONSOR) [10] 

 AtScale's universal semantic layer provides a consistent view of your
business data, regardless of who's looking and from which BI tool. Now
generally available, the new Developer Edition [10] allows developers
to build semantic models and access the semantic platform free of
charge. Read more and download [10] 

 ARGILLA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Argilla is a collaboration platform for AI engineers and domain
experts that require high-quality outputs, full data ownership, and
overall efficiency. 

 EFFICIENT LARGE LANGUAGE AND VISION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TroL is a new family of efficient large language and vision models
(LLVMs) with sizes of 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B parameters. 

 DOT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A standalone open source app meant for easy use of local LLMs and RAG
in particular to interact with documents and files similarly to
Nvidia's Chat with RTX.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW TO FIX AI'S ‚ÄúORIGINAL SIN‚Äù (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article addresses the copyright challenges posed by AI models
trained on copyrighted material without permission. It suggests AI
developers respect copyright signals, implement guardrails to prevent
generating infringing content, and develop business models that ensure
fair compensation for content creators, including techniques like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and creating cooperative AI
content ecosystems. 

 NVIDIA PASSES MICROSOFT IN MARKET CAP TO BECOME MOST VALUABLE PUBLIC
COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia is now the most valuable public company in the world. Its
market cap surpassed Microsoft's $3.32 trillion on Tuesday, reaching a
high of $3.34 trillion. Nvidia's shares are up more than 170% so far
this year. Its market cap hit $3 trillion for the first time earlier
this month. Nvidia's rise has been so rapid the company has yet to be
added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the stock benchmark of the
30 most valuable US companies. 

 TAKEAWAYS FROM OPENAI AND GOOGLE'S MAY ANNOUNCEMENTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 OpenAI and Google have introduced advanced AI models that enable
real-time multimodal understanding and responses and promise improved
AI assistants and innovations in voice agents. OpenAI's GPT-4o boasts
double the speed and half the cost of its predecessor, while Google's
Gemini 1.5 Flash delivers a significant reduction in latency and cost.
Both tech giants are integrating AI across their ecosystems, with
OpenAI eyeing consumer markets, which could potentially reach up to a
billion users, with its products and partnerships.
