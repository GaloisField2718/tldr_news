RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 V-STAR: TRAINING VERIFIERS FOR SELF-TAUGHT REASONERS (31 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 V-STaR is a novel approach to improving large language models that
utilizes both correct and incorrect solutions generated during
self-improvement to train a verifier, which then selects the best
solution at inference time. The method has shown significant
improvements in accuracy on code generation and math reasoning
benchmarks compared to existing approaches, potentially offering a
more efficient way to enhance LLM performance. 

 FAST 3D GENERATION FROM SINGLE IMAGES (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Vista3D is a new framework that generates 3D models from a single
image in just 5 minutes. Using a two-phase approach, it quickly forms
rough geometry before refining the details, capturing both visible and
hidden aspects of objects for more complete 3D reconstructions. 

 HEART MONITORING FROM FACIAL VIDEOS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 PhysMamba is a new framework designed for remote heart monitoring via
facial videos, addressing challenges in capturing long-range
physiological signals.

 GOT OCR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A somewhat amazing advancement in general-purpose optical character
recognition (OCR) that can read text from images with great
performance. This particular version dramatically improves in-the-wild
OCR as well. 

 FISH SPEECH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Powerful voice generation and single-shot voice cloning. Completely
open source and easy to get running. 

 1X GENIE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Genie is a video generation for world model systems. 1x Robotics has
open-sourced a version that mirrors the one it trained internally.

 OPENAI SAYS IT'S FIXED ISSUE WHERE CHATGPT APPEARED TO BE MESSAGING
USERS UNPROMPTED (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A Reddit user reported that OpenAI's ChatGPT initiated a conversation
unprompted, leading to speculation about new engagement features.
OpenAI acknowledged the issue and issued a fix, attributing it to a
glitch with unsent messages. Debate continues over the authenticity of
the incident, with similar reports from other users. 

 ANNOUNCING PIXTRAL 12B (8 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Pixtral 12B excels in multimodal tasks, maintaining state-of-the-art
performance on text-only benchmarks, and supports variable image sizes
in a 128K token context window. Its architecture includes a new 400M
parameter vision encoder and a 12B parameter multimodal decoder based
on Mistral Nemo. Pixtral outperforms many open and closed models in
multimodal reasoning and instruction following without compromising on
text capabilities. 

 SCALING: THE STATE OF PLAY IN AI (13 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini are becoming increasingly capable as
they scale up in size, data, and computing power, leading to improved
performance across various tasks. Current Gen2 models like GPT-4 and
Claude 3.5 are leading the market, with upcoming Gen3 models expected
to further escalate capabilities and costs. The discovery of a new
scaling law in AI, pertaining to increased "thinking" during
inference, promises further advancements in AI performance beyond just
model training.
