HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 VOLTRON DATA ACQUIRES CLAYPOT (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The enterprise data toolkit acquired Claypot's real-time AI tools and
team for an undisclosed sum. Voltron aims to continue bringing access
to data to the enterprise. 

 FTC INVESTIGATING MICROSOFT, AMAZON, AND GOOGLE INVESTMENTS INTO
OPENAI AND ANTHROPIC (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into the investments
of Big Tech companies that provide cloud services to smaller AI
companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS NEW AI IS LEARNING TO DIAGNOSE PATIENTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Google DeepMind has developed an AI model called AMIE (Articulate
Medical Intelligence Explorer) to assist in healthcare. Trained on
medical texts and dialogues, AMIE will provide explanations of medical
conditions and potentially aid in diagnostics. AMIE outperformed human
physicians in a controlled trial. Its effectiveness in real-world
scenarios remains to be tested.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMP V1 3B MULTIMODAL MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Another multimodal model trained on Phi-2 and SigLIP. This one
achieves extremely promising performance and is small enough to run
on-device. 

 MATRYOSHKA REPRESENTATION LEARNING (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's new embeddings can change size based on your needs. This is
theorized to be due to the nesting doll method of learning, which
learns features at various granularity. 

 MEDICAL VIDEO SEGMENTATION (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Vivim is a new framework for medical video object segmentation that
effectively processes long video sequences. Vivim compresses
spatiotemporal data efficiently utilizing the state space model
approach, delivering faster and more accurate segmentation results
compared to traditional methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 HUGGINGFACE WEBDATASET (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 WebDataset is a format that combines multiple records together.
Anything with the same prefix is treated as an instance. It is ideal
for streaming and fast data loading. 

 LLMS FROM SCRATCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An incomplete but promising set of tasks for learning how to build
language models from scratch. 

 MULTIMODAL PATHWAY: TRANSFORMERS WITH IRRELEVANT DATA FROM OTHER
MODALITIES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This project proposes a novel approach for enhancing transformers
that uses unrelated data from different modalities, such as improving
an image model using audio data. Multimodal Pathway uniquely connects
transformers of two different modalities, allowing a target modality
to benefit from the strengths of another.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPLORING COLBERT AND RAGATOUILLE (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ColBERT is an excellent model for embedding queries and index data
for RAG applications. This post explores the intuition behind the
method and performs some benchmarks. 

 ZERO-SHOT AMODAL SEGMENTATION (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pix2Gestalt is a framework designed for zero-shot amodal
segmentation. It is adept at reconstructing complete object shapes and
appearances when they are partially obscured. Leveraging large-scale
diffusion models, Pix2Gestalt excels in challenging scenarios,
including artistic images that defy usual patterns. 

 DO AI SAFETY ORGS WANT TO BAN OPEN SOURCE? (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Many groups are trying to grapple with the challenges that come with
rapidly advancing AI technology. Some of their moves can be seen as
anti-competitive. It is a complex problem with valid arguments on both
sides.
