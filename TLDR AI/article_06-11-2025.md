 MOVE FASTER WITH AI: BUILD SECURE, MAINTAINABLE CODE YOU CAN TRUST
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI is speeding things up, but all that new code creates a bottleneck
— who's verifying the quality and security? Don't let unverified
code stall your merges.

Sonar's automated review [4] gives you the control back, building the
trust you need in every line of code, human- or AI-written. With
SonarQube [5], your team can:

 	* USE AI WITHOUT FEAR: Get continuous analysis for quality and
security.
 	* FIX ISSUES EARLY: Detect and apply automated fixes before you
merge.
 	* MAINTAIN YOUR STANDARDS: Ensure all code meets your team's quality
bar, every time, for long-term code health.

Learn how Sonar fuels AI-enabled development [4] while building trust
into every line of code.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE PLANS TO RELEASE GEMINI 3 PRO PREVIEW IN NOVEMBER (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google's Gemini 3 Pro preview model has appeared in VertexAI code,
labeled '11-2025', suggesting a November launch. The timeline matches
prior testing activity observed in AI Studio. Google has not issued
any official statements about the launch. 

 OPENAI ISN'T YET WORKING TOWARD AN IPO, CFO SAYS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, said the company is
not planning to IPO in the short term. It will instead prioritize
growth and R&D over profitability. OpenAI is hoping the government
will support its offers to increase data center capacity by helping to
guarantee the financing for the chips behind its deals. The
depreciation rates of AI chips are uncertain, making it more expensive
for companies to raise the debt needed to buy them. Friar claims
OpenAI could reach profitability on very healthy gross margins if it
weren't seeking to invest so aggressively. 

 GOOGLE GEMINI'S DEEP RESEARCH CAN LOOK INTO YOUR EMAILS, DRIVE, AND
CHATS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google Gemini's "Deep Research" now uses Gmail, Drive, and Chat data
for AI-generated reports. The feature can create detailed research
plans and reports, integrating personal workspace data with web
searches. Currently available on desktop, Google plans to roll out
mobile access soon.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SEMANTIC SEARCH FOR CURSOR'S CODING AGENT (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cursor's coding agent improved performance by incorporating custom
semantic search over codebases, leading to higher accuracy, fewer user
iterations, and better retention of code changes. 

 THOUGHTS BY A NON-ECONOMIST ON AI AND ECONOMICS (20 MINUTE READ) [10]


 METR data shows AI task completion capabilities doubling every 6
months, meaning if today's models handle 2-hour tasks, they'll handle
8-hour tasks in a year and full workdays in 18 months. Under more
modest projections, where 9% of tasks are automated each year,
industrial revolution-scale gains will come within the next two
decades.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 YOU DON'T NEED 10 DIFFERENT AI TOOLS TO DEPLOY AN AGENT (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 It only takes 1 platform to fast track agentic AI. OutSystems Agent
Workbench [11] provides no-code tools, security guardrails, and
automated quality reviews so you can deliver human-AI collaboration
without the sprawl. Bosch, Heineken, and EDP are already using it to
build agentic AI systems. Build with Agent Workbench [11] 

 ENABLING TRILLION-PARAMETER MODELS ON AWS EFA (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Perplexity published code enabling trillion-parameter
mixture-of-experts models to run efficiently across multiple AWS
servers for the first time, opening up less advanced data centers to
AI inference. The challenge is that large models, even many open
weights models, are too large to fit on single servers, but AWS'
networking hardware was too slow for the constant inter-server
communication these models require. 

 STRUCTURED OUTPUT IN GEMINI API (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google enhanced the Gemini API with expanded JSON Schema support and
improved property ordering, making structured outputs more reliable
for use in multi-agent workflows and database tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PINTEREST CEO TOUTS OPEN SOURCE AI: ‘TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCE' WITH
REDUCED COSTS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pinterest plans to move forward with open source models for its
various use cases. They come at a fraction of the cost of the larger
model providers, and they deliver value to users effectively. The
company will be observing user feedback to see if people actually want
AI shopping agents before implementing them. The company is planning
to roll out personalized boards curated with AI. 

 SNAP AND PERPLEXITY SIGN $400 MILLION DEAL TO PUT AI SEARCH DIRECTLY
IN SNAPCHAT (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Perplexity, an AI search engine, will appear directly in Snapchat
sometime in early 2026. It will become a prominent part of Snapchat's
'chat' interface. Perplexity is paying Snap $400 million for the
integration. Snap may pursue similar partnerships with other AI
companies.
