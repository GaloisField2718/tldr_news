 WISH YOUR AI COPILOT ACTUALLY KNEW YOUR CODEBASE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Tired of AI coding assistants that spit out generic code?

Augment Code [4] is different:

 	* Augment is the most context-aware developer AI. It deeply
understands how your team builds software.
 	* Augment learns from your entire codebase, documentation and
dependencies in real-time.
 	* Augment scales to handle even the largest codebases (10M+ line
monolith? no problem)

Customers like Webflow, Lemonade, and Kong say that working with
Augment is like pairing with a principal engineer on your team, 24/7.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DARIO AMONDEI ON DEEPSEEK AND EXPORT CONTROLS (15 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic's CEO gives great insight into the DeepSeek models, cost
curves, and innovation. He expertly lays out the landscape and points
to flaws in the market reaction. Additionally, he reveals that Sonnet
3.5 only cost $10m or so dollars to train. The main point of the
article is export controls. 

 OPENAI ACCUSES DEEPSEEK (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has found evidence that the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used
its proprietary models to train an open-source competitor. The
suspected "distillation" process allows smaller models to mimic larger
ones at a lower cost, raising concerns over intellectual property
breaches. 

 ZUCKERBERG DISMISSES DEEPSEEK, COMMITS TO AI INVESTMENT (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Mark Zuckerberg remains unfazed by competition from DeepSeek. He has
reaffirmed Meta's commitment to massive AI investments and focus on
model development and computational resources.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 QWEN 2.5 MAX MOE MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Qwen team has released its MoE earlier than expected. The model
shows really strong performance, matching many top models, including
DeepSeek v3. 

 OPTIMIZING LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL TRAINING USING FP4 QUANTIZATION (30
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 One of the key levers that can be pulled to reduce training and
inference costs is quantization. Getting these models to run at lower
precision saves on the number of GPUs and FLOPs needed for training.
This work shows, on a small scale of 100B tokens, how to train at FP4.


 TEXT-TO-VIDEO GENERATION WITH CASCADEV (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 CascadeV introduces a cascaded latent diffusion model that generates
2K-resolution videos with improved efficiency. It employs a novel 3D
attention mechanism and can be integrated with existing text-to-video
models to enhance resolution and frame rate without fine-tuning.

 WRITERS VS. AI: MICROSOFT STUDY REVEALS HOW GPT-4 IMPACTS CREATIVITY
AND VOICE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Microsoft and USC conducted a study using GPT-4 to explore how
generative AI affects writers' authenticity and creativity. Writers
expressed concerns about AI impacting originality, emotional
satisfaction, and ownership of work. Despite initial skepticism,
personalized AI models that align with a writer's style helped
alleviate these concerns, enhancing creativity without compromising
authenticity. 

 WE INTERVIEW THE FOUNDER BEHIND MEGAN, AN AI HR AGENT (14 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Interview Mega HR has launched "Megan", an AI agent designed to
streamline and automate recruitment processes. Megan handles tasks
from job posting to candidate management, aiming to improve hiring
efficiency and transparency. 

 DEEPSEEK'S R1 RECIPE (27 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Nathan Lambert breaks down the recipe for R1 and talks through what
it means for us now and for the field broadly. Specifically, he
focuses on the interesting application of reinforcement learning.
