 FYI: AI IS ALREADY MAKING ONE MILLION PHONE CALLS A DAY ON BEHALF OF
SOME COMPANIES ü§Ø (SPONSOR) [4] 

 üëã Say hi to Bland, the world's most realistic AI phone-calling
agent. [4]

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It
can:

üó£Ô∏è Respond in any voice or language.

ü¶æ It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for
some of the world's largest businesses.

For enterprises [5], it's been a financial game changer across sales,
operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect
employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, give it a call yourself. [4]

Or TLDR readers can get exclusive access to an even more advanced

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ARTIFACTS AVAILABLE TO ALL (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has made Artifacts generally available, including on
mobile. 

 CEREBRAS INFERENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cerebras' chipset has massive unified memory. As a result, it can
sidestep bandwidth issues and serve models at thousands of tokens per
second. 

 OPENAI AIMS TO RELEASE NEW AI MODEL, ‚ÄòSTRAWBERRY', IN FALL (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI is planning to release a new AI product called "Strawberry" in
the fall. It will feature advanced reasoning capabilities, such as the
ability to solve previously unseen math problems, and can perform
high-level tasks like developing market strategies.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 PHYSICS OF LANGUAGE MODELS: PART 3.3 (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The 3rd part of a series, this paper explores scaling laws and how
many bits are required to store knowledge in a model. The answer seems
to be around 2 bits of knowledge per parameter. 

 FIRE-FLYER AI HPC (34 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeepSeek has released a paper outlining its hardware-software
co-design strategy for DL training. 

 ANNOUNCING HIGGS LLAMA V2 (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Boson AI has introduced Higgs-Llama-3-70B-v2, a new model that excels
in dialog and comprehension benchmarks like Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval
2.0. The model reduces response regeneration rates by 21.6% and boosts
day 1 retention by 5.3% compared to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Enhanced by an
in-house reward model, Higgs Judger, it ties with Google's Gemini 1.5
Pro on performance.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 KEYWORD SEARCH IS A DUD (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Customers don't always use the words you expect them to, which tends
to break keyword-based solutions for knowledge base and in-product
search. Luckily, genAI does much better. Make your help center
actually helpful with Ask AI's Generative Search [13]. Minutes to
deploy, no developer needed. Get 2 months free [13] 

 HYBRID MODEL POST TRAINING COOKBOOK (25 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Pre-training hybrid (Mamba style) models is different from
pre-training normal Transformers. This post explores how to scale
different hyperparameters, data acquisition, and others to get the
performance you want. 

 LLAMA DUO: SYSTEM FOR MODEL FALLBACK (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This is a framework that fine-tunes small models to serve as a
fallback when closed API models go down. It shows how to migrate from
a large to a small model smoothly. 

 LITSERVE (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 LitServe is an easy-to-use, flexible serving engine for AI models
built on FastAPI. Features like batching, streaming, and GPU
autoscaling eliminate the need to rebuild a FastAPI server per model.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLAVA BITNET (HUGGING FACE HUB) [17] 

 Llava BitNet is the first ternary (-1, 0, 1) weight model trained on
VLM tasks. The model, weights, and scripts are in the process of being
fully open sourced. The technical report will be released soon and
suggests the model has promising performance. 

 INFERENCE IS FREE AND INSTANT (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While large language models (LLMs) may not significantly improve in
reasoning capabilities, their decreasing costs and increasing speeds
will make them more useful for repetitive tasks. Although these models
may lack true understanding, they can still efficiently handle
straightforward tasks. 

 MEMORY-EFFICIENT LLM TRAINING (17 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Online Subspace Descent is a new optimizer that improves the training
of LLMs by enhancing memory efficiency.

QUICK LINKS

 QWEN 2 AUDIO (HUGGING FACE HUB) [20] 

 Qwen has released audio input style models that can reason about
music, audio, and sound. 

 SKETCH2SCENE (7 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Using a number of models in sequence, this group was able to create
an amazing model that generates fully playable 3D game scenes based on
a single input sketch. 

 THIS 1MM 'FAN ON A CHIP' COULD PUT ACTIVE COOLING INSIDE ULTRA-THIN
GADGETS (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 xMEMS has introduced the XMC-2400 ¬µCooling chip, a 1mm-tall
solid-state fan designed to cool down slim devices like smartphones.
