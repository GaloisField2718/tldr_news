HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DEEPSEEK-MATH-V2 (GITHUB REPO) [4] 

 DeepSeek's new math reasoning model achieves gold-level performance
on IMO 2025, matching recent results from Google and OpenAI. The
approach trains an LLM-based proof verifier that serves as a reward
model. This incentivizes the generator to verify step-by-step
reasoning rather than just final answers, addressing the fundamental
limitation that correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. 

 OPENAI CUTS OFF MIXPANEL AFTER ANALYTICS LEAK EXPOSES API USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI API users may be affected by a recent breach at data analytics
provider Mixpanel. Only API users are affected - normal ChatGPT users
don't need to take any action. The data includes names, approximate
locations, operating system and browser details, and user IDs. OpenAI
dropped Mixpanel as a result of the attack. It is also carrying out a
wider security review across its vendor ecosystem. 

 GOOGLE CHANGES GEMINI 3 PRO FREE ACCESS LIMITS DUE TO ‘HIGH DEMAND'
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has updated the access elements for Gemini 3 Pro. Free users
are now only guaranteed basic access, where daily limits may change
frequently when using Thinking with 3 Pro. The limits have likely
decreased, given the industry's general demand trends. NotebookLM
rolled back access to the new Nano Banana Pro-powered Infographics and
Slide Decks for free users and implemented limits for Pro users.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE MOAT OF THE SEARCH INDEX (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ChatGPT surpasses Google's search by using an "agent" approach,
extracting relevant information from multiple sources and synthesizing
answers, which diminishes Google's traditional search index advantage.
This method reduces the impact of any single search result's failure,
although it struggles with long-tail, fresh, or SEO-heavy queries. The
traditional search engine moat has largely vanished, with AI-driven
models increasingly blending search capabilities. 

 HOW TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE PROMPT FOR NANO BANANA PRO (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Designing a comic is a complex challenge that brings together
storytelling, visual structure, stylistic consistency, and the ability
to translate abstract concepts into illustrated sequences. This post
details how to create a comic using Nano Banana Pro. It provides a
meta-prompt that readers can use to generate prompts for Nano Banana. 

 REVIEW OF DEEPSEEK OCR (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and
DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. It can generate training data for
LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day in production. This post
presents some initial thoughts from reading the released paper.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 BETTER AGENTS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Better Agents is a CLI tool and a set of standards for agent
building. It makes coding assistants experts in any agent framework.
The tool generates an AGENTS.md that ensures industry best practices.
The CLI guides users through selecting a programming language, agent
framework, coding assistant, LLM provider, and API keys. 

 COMPOUNDING ENGINEERING PLUGIN (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The Compounding Engineering Plugin is a Claude Code plugin that
transforms how developers plan, build, and review code using
AI-powered tools that systematically improve their development
workflow. Compound engineering is the idea that each unit of
engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier, not
harder. The plugin provides the tools to make compound engineering
practical. 

 INTELLECT-3: A 100B+ MOE TRAINED WITH LARGE-SCALE RL (10 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 INTELLECT-3 is a 100B+ parameter Mixture-of-Experts that achieves
state-of-the-art performance for its size across math, code, science,
and reasoning benchmarks. It was trained with both SFT and RL on top
of the GLM 4.5 Air base model. The researchers used a diverse and
challenging mix of RL environments designed to enhance the reasoning
and agentic capabilities of their model. Full details about the
training are available. 

 OPEN DEEP RESEARCH (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An experimental, fully open-source research assistant built on
LangGraph that automates deep topic research by planning, gathering,
and writing structured markdown reports—either via a
human-in-the-loop workflow or a multi-agent architecture—with
configurable models, search tools, prompting, and evaluation
integration. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 OFF-THE-RAILS COST (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A 'wasted thread' is when a model starts spitting out tons of leaked
thinking or repeating tokens. This usually means users have to abandon
and revert the thread. 17.8% of all costs incurred by Gemini users in
Amp were on 'wasted tokens'. This is more than 2x worse than Sonnet
and almost 8x worse than Opus. 

 THE CURRENT STATE OF THE THEORY THAT GPL PROPAGATES TO AI MODELS
TRAINED ON GPL CODE (45 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The jury is still out on whether GPL propagation to models should be
pursued or avoided. It is unlikely that it will become a reality any
time soon. Current lawsuits are seeking injunctions and damages rather
than the forced GPL-ization of models, so it is still a legally
uncharted territory. We need to continue exploring how to make
technology innovation and software freedom compatible. 

 NVIDIA REPORTEDLY NO LONGER SUPPLYING VRAM TO ITS GPU BOARD PARTNERS
IN RESPONSE TO MEMORY CRUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Nvidia will reportedly stop bundling video memory with the GPUs it
sells to AIBs. Partners will be left to source the required VRAM on
their own. For larger vendors, this shouldn't be a problem as it is
already standard practice. The move could put a lot of pressure on
low-scale operators and put them at risk of shutting down.

 MODEL WEIGHT PRESERVATION IS NOT ENOUGH (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 We need to think about instance preservation if we're serious about
model welfare. 

 PERPLEXITY SAYS ITS AI PERSONAL SHOPPER ‘PUTS YOU FIRST' (2 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Perplexity launched a free AI-powered shopping feature for US users,
allowing direct purchases through PayPal. 

 ALIBABA AND BYTEDANCE ALLEGEDLY TRAIN QWEN AND DOUBAO LLMS USING
NVIDIA CHIPS, DESPITE EXPORT CONTROLS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Chinese technology giants are increasingly training their most
advanced artificial intelligence models in Southeast Asia in data
centers equipped with high-end Nvidia GPUs. 

 CLAUDE SCIENTIFIC SKILLS (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 This repository contains a collection of over 123 ready-to-use
scientific skills for Claude. 

 THE IMPOSSIBLE PROMPT THAT'S EASY FOR HUMANS (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 This post presents a rare prompt with a simple, objective answer that
is trivially verifiable, in which LLMs fail 100% of the time, but most
humans can produce a correct answer. 

 INTELLIGENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The topic of intelligence is too high-dimensional for any
low-dimensional narrative to be perfectly accurate.
