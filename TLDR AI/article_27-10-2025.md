 LOOKING FOR A PRACTICAL AI WORKFLOW FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT? JOIN
MIRO'S 3-PART MASTERCLASS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pressured to use AI, but not sure how? Miro's put together a
masterclass series to share real-world examples [4] of AI helping
product teams.

Each focused session includes live demonstrations [4], practical
frameworks, and 25 minutes of Q&A. You'll learn about:

 	* An ROI model for justifying investment in AI-driven product
intelligence,
 	* Clear implementation steps for AI workflows,
 	* Rules for when to use AI prototyping vs. traditional design tools,
 	* Techniques for turning any content into testable prototypes.

Register for all three sessions, free [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SOFTBANK APPROVES REMAINING $22.5 BILLION OF OPENAI INVESTMENT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The second installment is contingent on OpenAI restructuring to a
for-profit by the end of the year, paving the way for an eventual IPO.


 OPENAI REPORTEDLY DEVELOPING NEW GENERATIVE MUSIC TOOL (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Undeterred by its many ongoing copyright battles, OpenAI is building
a text-to-music model that could add accompaniment to videos
(including those generated by Sora) or layer instruments onto vocal
tracks. 

 OPENAI MIGHT BE TESTING GPT-5.1-MINI UPGRADE FOR CHATGPT (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 ChatGPT's model selector temporarily showed 'GPT-5 Mini Scout' for
some business account users on Friday, sparking immediate speculation
about its purpose. An update to OpenAI's official JavaScript agent
library surfaced shortly after with a new reference to 'GPT-5.1 Mini'
in a test file, suggesting that 'GPT-5.1 Mini' was the intended
production name for 'Mini Scout'. References to the new model have
since been removed.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STRESS-TESTING MODEL SPECS REVEALS CHARACTER DIFFERENCES AMONG
LANGUAGE MODELS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A research collaboration between Anthropic and Thinking Machines Lab
found that Claude, GPT, Grok, and Gemini models have values that
contradict what their creators publicly specify. By generating over
300,000 scenarios where models have to choose between competing
principles, they found that Claude models prioritize ethical
responsibility, OpenAI models favor efficiency, and Gemini/Grok
emphasize emotional connection. 

 MITIGATING PROMPT INJECTION (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Perplexity has outlined its defense-in-depth approach to securing
Comet, its AI assistant browser, against malicious prompt injection,
an emerging class of attacks that manipulate model behavior without
exploiting software vulnerabilities.

 BUILDING BLOCKS OF AGENTIC AI FROM META (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A PyTorch-native stack of open-source tools for agentic AI, including
kernel development, distributed systems, and reinforcement learning,
with support for massive GPU workloads and edge deployments. 

 VISUAL FEATURES ACROSS MODALITIES: SVG AND ASCII ART REVEAL
CROSS-MODAL UNDERSTANDING (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Claude's internal neurons can recognize when text forms visual art.
The same neuron that fires for the word "eyes" also activates when it
sees @ symbols arranged as ASCII eyes or SVG circle elements
positioned as eyes within a face. Anthropic researchers found these
cross-modal patterns across mouths, ears, dogs, and cats,
demonstrating that the model builds associations between concepts and
their visual representations across formats, similar to how humans can
recognize a smiley face whether it's drawn, described, or coded in
SVG. 

 INTRODUCING FLASHPACK: LIGHTNING-FAST MODEL LOADING FOR PYTORCH (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 FlashPack is a high-throughput file format and loading mechanism for
PyTorch that makes model checkpoint I/O blazingly fast. It can load
any model 3–6× faster than with the current state-of-the-art
methods. FlashPack is wrapped in a lightweight, pure-Python package
that works anywhere. It even works on systems without access to GPU
Direct Storage.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CODE LIKE A SURGEON (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The goal isn't delegating your core work and then becoming an auditor
or editor. It should be offloading secondary tasks so you can focus on
what really matters. Tasks like writing documentation, fixing
TypeScript errors, and spiking out changes are the kind of grunt work
AI agents excel at that can run async in the background. 

 INTEL HAS CUT 35,500 JOBS IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Intel has let go of as many as 20,500 employees in the last 3 months.
The lay-offs appear to be largely confined to Q2. CEO Lip-Bu Tan had
previously publicly outlined plans to flatten the company and reduce
the number of mid-tier managers, but the layoffs also affected
engineers and technicians. The company's latest financial report
indicated that it reduced its R&D budget by over $800 million
year-over-year despite a revenue increase, a clear indicator that it
is axing multiple projects and initiatives that were at various stages
of research and development.
