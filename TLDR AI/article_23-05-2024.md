HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI PARTNERS WITH NEWS CORP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI and News Corp (which includes WSJ, NYP, The Times, and other
publishers) agreed to bring its news content to OpenAI's platform,
which they claim will increase the usability and accuracy of
generations. 

 STANFORD HAI RELEASES UPDATED FOUNDATION MODEL TRANSPARENCY INDEX (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stanford HAI released the latest version of its Foundation Model
Transparency Index, which evaluates the transparency of 14 major AI
developers, including OpenAI and Google. These companies disclosed new
information previously unavailable to the public, marking a
significant improvement and willingness to open up the discourse about
their models. Despite this progress, the average transparency score
was just 58 out of 100, highlighting significant gaps in areas like
data access, model trustworthiness, and downstream impact. 

 MICROSOFT RELEASES PHI-SILICA (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft has announced the general availability of its Phi-3 models
and introduced Phi-3-Silica, a small language model optimized for
Neural Processing Units in Copilot+ PCs. Phi-3-Silica, with 3.3
billion parameters, offers fast local inferencing with low power
consumption, marking a significant step in integrating advanced AI
directly into Windows devices to enhance productivity and
accessibility. It will be available in June.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 AURORA ATMOSPHERIC PREDICTION MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft has trained a foundation model for atmospheric predictions
which has set a new state-of-the-art on 5 and 10 day global weather
prediction tests. 

 INTRODUCING MATHBENCH: A COMPREHENSIVE MATH BENCHMARK FOR LLMS (24
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MathBench is a new benchmark designed to provide a thorough
assessment of large language models' mathematical abilities. 

 A FASTER NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed Wav-KAN, a neural network framework that
uses wavelet functions to improve interpretability and performance.
Unlike traditional models, Wav-KAN captures both high and
low-frequency data components, leading to faster training and
increased robustness.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 DO WE REALLY NEED MAMBA FOR VISION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Mamba is a strong Transformer alternative that has been gaining steam
for its ability to use fewer FLOPs while maintaining performance.
However, it may not be necessary for some applications. This work
shows that a well-tuned CNN baseline outperforms Mamba on a set of
vision tasks. 

 POWERFUL VISION MODELS ON YOUR PHONE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 MiniCMP-V has a new version trained on top of Llama 3. This 8B model
outperforms many closed proprietary models on a wide variety of tasks.
It can handle 30 different languages and excels at OCR and visual
question answering. 

 IMPROVING MEDICAL AI ACCURACY (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 MedLFQA is a new benchmark dataset designed to improve the factual
accuracy of long-form responses from large language models in the
medical field. OLAPH is a framework that trains LLMs to reduce
inaccuracies by using automatic evaluations and preference
optimization. 

üéÅ 

MISCELLANEOUS

 TARSIER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Reworkd has released Tarsier, a new tool to enhance LLMs for web
interaction tasks by visually tagging elements on webpages using
brackets and IDs. Tarsier allows an LLM without vision to understand a
webpage's structure via OCR-generated text representations
outperforming vision-language models in benchmarks. 

 THE OLD-FASHIONED LIBRARY AT THE HEART OF THE A.I. BOOM (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's headquarters, a renovated mayonnaise factory with a
library-themed design, is emblematic of the company's language-focused
success with ChatGPT. The office contrastingly serves as a reminder of
the ongoing legal debates over the use of copyrighted material in AI
training. Despite these disputes, OpenAI staff view the library as a
space for inspiration, reinforcing their belief in the synergy between
human and AI-driven creativity. 

 CHAOS AND TENSION AT OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ilya Sutskever has departed from OpenAI amidst concerns over the
company's commitment to AI safety, signaling a potentially worrying
trend as three other key personnel have also recently resigned. These
departures raise questions about the impact on the company's
safety-focused mission and its nonprofit status as it pursues
commercialization. These events may also reverberate through legal and
regulatory landscapes, prompting scrutiny from stakeholders in
Washington.
