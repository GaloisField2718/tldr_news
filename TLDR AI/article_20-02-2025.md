 A NOTE FROM BASETEN CO-FOUNDER AND CEO TUHIN SRIVASTAVA (SPONSOR) [4]


 Hey TLDR readers,

Our company Baseten, the platform for mission-critical inference, just
announced our $75 million Series C [4], so I wanted to share thoughts
on inference in 2025.

Every AI product will hit existential inference problems as it scales
in production this year. These problems – spanning model
performance, multi-cluster infrastructure, and model management –
are hard to solve.

Our customers partner with us to bring high-quality AI products to
market quickly. We're 100% focused on the non-negotiables of
inference: speed, reliability, and cost-efficiency. That dedication
has earned us incredible customers as we've grown fivefold
year-over-year.

We'd love to have TLDR readers as customers [5] and teammates [6].
Let's connect!

Cheers,

Tuhin

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE'S AI CO-SCIENTIST (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has put together a really clever and compelling system that
uses test time compute and feedback mechanisms to produce scientific
artifacts that can be verified in a number of ways. 

 LAMBDA RAISES $480M SERIES D (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The chip, compute, and cloud company has raised additional funding to
continue expanding its cloud platform. 

 THE ANTHROPIC ECONOMIC INDEX (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic launched the Anthropic Economic Index to study AI's impact
on labor markets using data from millions of Claude.ai conversations.
The initial report shows AI is mainly used for software development
and technical writing, with augmentation favored over automation. A
dataset is open-sourced, encouraging researchers to further explore
AI's influence on employment, productivity, and policy development.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 CRAMMING 1568 TOKENS INTO A SINGLE VECTOR (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This work explores the limits of representational capacity by
attempting to fit as many tokens as possible into a single fixed size
embedding vector. 

 MULTI-STEP PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION FOR RLHF (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This paper introduces Multi-step Preference Optimization (MPO), a
reinforcement learning approach that models alignment as a two-player
Markov game to improve multi-turn interactions. 

 GRAPH STRUCTURE LEARNING (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 UnGSL is a novel method that incorporates uncertainty estimation into
Graph Structure Learning to refine node connections. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TRAINING ROBOTS WITH EGOCENTRIC DATA (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Georgia Tech researchers leveraged Meta's Project Aria to train
robots using egocentric video data. The EgoMimic framework reduces the
reliance on traditional teleoperation, accelerating humanoid robot
learning from human demonstrations. 

 MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION (31 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 QMaxViT-Unet+ enhances medical image segmentation using a hybrid
Transformer-CNN approach with weak supervision. It outperforms
existing methods across multiple datasets, achieving high segmentation
accuracy. 

 PYTORCH KERNEL FOR THE HADAMARD PRODUCT (30 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An interesting technical deep dive into ways to accelerate the
Hadamard product on GPU hardware. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW GENERATIVE AI CAPABILITIES IN GOOGLE ADS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google Ads has introduced generative AI tools to help advertisers
create diverse and engaging assets. New features include AI-generated
images of adults, asset audience recommendations, and asset testing
for Performance Max campaigns. 

 GALILEO'S AI AGENT LEADERBOARD COMPARES MODEL PERFORMANCE (10 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Galileo set out to answer the question "How do top LLMs perform in
real-world agentic scenarios?" by releasing a leaderboard ranking how
well different AI agents effectively utilize tools and functions in
complex scenarios. Their analysis of 17 leading LLMs shows
Gemini-2.0-flash leading the pack while highlighting rapid
improvements in open-source alternatives like mistral-small. 

 HUMAN IMAGE ANIMATION (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 X-Dyna is a zero-shot, diffusion-based pipeline for animating a
single human image using facial expressions and body movements derived
from a driving video.
