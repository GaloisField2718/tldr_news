This practical guide [4] breaks down real-world MCP security risks and
offers actionable steps to help teams secure LLM integrations.

Inside the guide:

 	* Key risks with local and remote MCP servers
 	* Real-world threats like prompt injection and supply chain
compromise
 	* Actionable steps for safely using MCP tools
