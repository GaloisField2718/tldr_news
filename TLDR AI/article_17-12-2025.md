 HOW TO STOP BOTS FROM ABUSING FREE TRIALS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Free trials help AI apps grow, but bots and fake accounts exploit
them [5]. They steal tokens, burn compute, and disrupt real users. 

Cursor, the fast-growing AI code assistant, uses WorkOS Radar [6] to
detect and stop abuse in real time. With device fingerprinting and
behavioral signals, Radar blocks fraud before it reaches your app.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-IMAGE-1.5 (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has launched GPT-Image-1.5, a faster and more accurate image
generation model with improved instruction-following and editing. The
rollout follows competitive pressure from Google's Gemini 3 and Nano
Banana Pro models, which recently led key benchmarks. 

 SAM AUDIO (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has introduced SAM Audio, a new model capable of isolating
specific sounds from complex audio using text, visual, or time-based
prompts. As part of the Segment Anything family, it brings flexible,
prompt-driven sound editing to tasks like removing background noise or
isolating instruments in a recording. 

 OPENAI ROLLS BACK CHATGPT'S MODEL ROUTER SYSTEM FOR MOST USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI quietly abandoned the automatic model router, a key feature of
its GPT-5, for Free and Go tier users, defaulting them to GPT-5.2
Instant instead of routing complex queries to reasoning models. The
router had increased free users' reasoning model usage from under 1%
to 7% but a source says it hurt daily active users because people
don't want to wait 20 seconds for a better answer.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 INFERENCE ECONOMICS 101: RESERVED COMPUTE VERSUS INFERENCE APIS (20
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The infrastructure layer is no longer converging on a single 'best'
model. Instead, it is splitting into two durable and economically
attractive markets. One side provides reserved and hourly compute
platforms designed to deliver predictability, control, and determinism
for customers willing to operate infrastructure directly. The other
side operates inference APIs, trading some control for scale while
absorbing utilization risk and abstracting complexity in exchange for
cost-efficiency and speed. Understanding the split is essential to
evaluating where value will accrue as inference becomes ubiquitous. 

 PROMPT CACHING: 10X CHEAPER LLM TOKENS, BUT HOW? (30 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Catched input tokens are currently 10 times cheaper than regular
input tokens for both OpenAI and Anthropic's APIs. They can even
reduce latency by up to 85% for long prompts. It is clear that these
providers aren't just saving responses and reusing them. This post
takes a look at what's actually cached and how prompt caching works in
general. 

 IS RESUMABLE LLM STREAMING HARD? NO, IT'S JUST ANNOYING (13 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 The state-of-the-art in large language model streaming is
surprisingly bad. Both Gemini and Claude require users to refresh the
page if their conversation is interrupted mid-stream. This guide shows
readers how to implement good, resumable LLM streams. This allows
users to refresh tabs mid-stream, switch between chats mid-stream,
navigate to other sections of an app without interrupting a stream,
and continue streams through momentary internet connection
disruptions.

 OPENAI LAUNCHES APPS SDK WITH MONETIZATION FOR CHATGPT (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Developers can now build apps that live inside ChatGPT and monetize
them through external checkout or, for select partners, Instant
Checkout that handles payments without leaving the chat interface. 

 QWEN-DOC FOR LONG-CONTEXT DOCUMENTS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 Qwen-Doc is an open-source initiative for Document AI, offering
models and tools to improve long-context understanding, parsing, and
agent-based reasoning for complex documents. 

 MIXTURE-OF-RECURSIONS (23 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 DeepMind researchers have introduced Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a
unified architecture that combines parameter sharing and adaptive
computation by using a recursive transformer with lightweight routing.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE SHIFT FROM TEXT TO DYNAMIC AI EXPERIENCES (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI's new CEO of Applications outlines how ChatGPT is moving
beyond chat toward a "fully generative UI" that surfaces the right
components based on what you're doing: a dedicated image studio,
inline writing blocks, quick visual answers for measurements or sports
scores, and tappable highlights that pull up additional context. 

 META AI GLASSES WITH AUDIO FOCUS (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Meta updated its smartglasses with a feature to isolate conversations
in noisy environments and a new Spotify integration that plays music
based on what you're looking at. The updates roll out first on Ray-Ban
Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN glasses in the US and Canada.
