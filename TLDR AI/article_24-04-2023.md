HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

BARD CAN HELP YOU CODE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/?utm_source=tldrai] 

Google‚Äôs language model Bard, when launched, refused to answer
coding questions. That has changed now. It can help you code in a huge
variety of languages and does a pretty good job! There hasn‚Äôt been
any official validation released, so we don‚Äôt know how it compares
to other program synthesis models, but it‚Äôs always nice to have
options. 

MIND AND BRAIN (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691468/google-ai-deepmind-brain-merger?utm_source=tlrdai]


Deepmind and Google Brain are now one org led by Demis Hassabis from
Brain. The goal is to build AI focus internally to compete with much
of the external pressures from groups like OpenAI. One interesting
pivot here is that the new group, called Google Deepmind, has an
explicitly stated goal of ‚ÄúAI products‚Äù which is somewhat of a
departure from the previous group's focus. 

INTRODUCING W&B PROMPTS (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://wandb.ai/wandb/wb-announcements/reports/Introducing-W-B-Prompts-The-Present-Future-of-LLMOps--Vmlldzo0MTI4NjY5?utm_source=tldrai]


Weights & Biases (W&B) announces the release of W&B Prompts, a suite
of LLMOps tools designed for prompt engineers working with large
language models (LLMs). The new tools include one-line LangChain and
OpenAI integrations for logging, W&B Launch integration with OpenAI
Evals, and improved handling of text in W&B Tables. W&B also
introduces a JavaScript SDK for prompt exploration and model
generation tracking. In addition, the company is publishing a
whitepaper on LLM training best practices, releasing two LLM courses
on fine-tuning and LLMOps, and open sourcing WandBot, a GPT-4 powered
support bot.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

THEORY OF ADAM INSTABILITY (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Meta folks have been training some big models recently. Part of
the pain of that is loss spikes. This is where training diverges and
usually requires manual intervention to get things back on track. This
paper outlines a hypothesis for these spikes. They claim that Adam is
the culprit. Maybe some of the new optimizers like Lion or Shampoo can
help? 

REAL-TIME VIEW SYNTHESIS (3 MINUTE READ)
[http://raywzy.com/NDRF/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper presents a novel method that distills and bakes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) into efficient mesh-based neural
representations, enabling real-time rendering and compatibility with
parallel graphics pipelines. The approach uses a two-layer duplex
mesh, screen-space convolutions, and a multiview distillation
optimization strategy, resulting in superior performance and
effectiveness demonstrated through experiments on standard datasets. 

MULTI-MODAL FACE GENERATION AND EDITING (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://ziqihuangg.github.io/projects/collaborative-diffusion.html?utm_source=tldrai]


The paper introduces Collaborative Diffusion, a method that combines
pre-trained uni-modal diffusion models to achieve multi-modal face
generation and editing without retraining. By utilizing a dynamic
diffuser meta-network, the approach effectively hallucinates
multi-modal denoising steps and integrates multiple uni-modal
manipulations, demonstrating superior image quality and condition
consistency in extensive experiments.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

VOICE CLONING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/suno-ai/bark?utm_source=tldrai] 

Transformers continue their march into all modalities, this time
taking on audio with a cool voice cloning tool. There are some
limitations, but with just a few seconds of audio, you can get a
pretty great representation of your voice. 

LLAMA ACADEMY (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy?utm_source=tldrai] 

It seems like everywhere you look people are building retrieval
augmentation into language models. Here is another tool to do that,
using the almost-open sourced Llama models. This one has a nice recipe
you can follow to teach the model about novel APIs and SDKs. 

4 NEW CONTROLNET MODELS (HUGGINGFACE)
[https://huggingface.co/thibaud?utm_source=tldrai] 

ControlNet is a great way to use StableDiffusion to generate images
with more control over the shape of the output. There are a few new
models now trained such as the Normal Map, Segmentation, LineArt, and
Openpose with hands and face.

MISCELLANEOUS

IS AI-GENERATED MUSIC LEGAL? (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.semafor.com/article/04/18/2023/is-ai-generated-music-legal?utm_source=tldrai]


The success of the song Ghostwriter has led to a debate over the
legality of AI-generated music, which will likely be the subject of
multiple lawsuits soon. 

PRETRAINING IN RL (51 MINUTE VIDEO)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg6Tip6s_mA?utm_source=tldrai] 

Sergey Levine gives a great presentation discussing how offline RL can
pretrain models that actually work great in the online setting. He
outlines a few papers in this recent line of work. It is fascinating
to think of the applications here for language and beyond. 

PROMPT ENGINEERING VS BLIND PROMPTING (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://mitchellh.com/writing/prompt-engineering-vs-blind-prompting?utm_source=tldrai]


This article discusses the differences between prompt engineering and
blind prompting, highlighting the importance of understanding how to
effectively interact with AI models like ChatGPT, and the challenges
and benefits of each approach in generating desired outputs.
