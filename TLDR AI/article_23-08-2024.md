 GREPTILE: AN AI EXPERT THAT KNOWS YOUR CODE BASE LIKE THE BACK OF ITS
AI HAND, AVAILABLE THROUGH A REST API (SPONSOR) [4] 

 YC-backed Greptile's code review bot [4] summarizes changes in every
pull/merge request, and leaves comments that highlight potential
issues and unforeseen consequences.

And here's the interesting part. Rather than generic best practices,
Greptile writes comments that:

// Are context-aware [4], including the implications of changes on the
wider codebase.

// Address potential security or compliance issues [4] in the PR.

// Reference similar code or abstractions [4] that are already in the
codebase, to prevent repetition. 

The comments are short and sparse, so they don't take over your PR
comment section with noise.

features from Google Assistant not fully integrated. Despite these
issues, unique capabilities such as document summarization and
creative photo "reimagining" tools are intriguing benefits for Pixel
users.

 FIELDS THAT I REFERENCE WHEN THINKING ABOUT AI TAKEOVER PREVENTION
(11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post shares insights on designing and evaluating robust AI
safety measures, drawing parallels between AI control and fields
combating insider threats. It highlights the granular control
developers can exert over AIs compared to employees, while also noting
that unlike humans, AI duplicitousness can be consistently pervasive.
Although inspired by various fields like physical security and safety
engineering, AI control primarily differs due to its adversarial
nature and lack of complex system interactions.
