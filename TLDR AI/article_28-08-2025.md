 NEW RESEARCH EXPOSES THE CRISIS IN AI GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Implementing AI policies is much different from _enforcing_ them.
1Password's research found that 54% OF SECURITY LEADERS SAY THEIR AI
GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT IS WEAK_._ [4]

Security leaders also say they're struggling with: 

 	* Limited visibility into AI tool usage
 	* Unintentional exposure of sensitive data to AI
 	* Unmanaged and shadow AI 

In a nutshell: AI adoption has outpaced our ability to secure it. The
good news? It's not too late to catch up.

Read the research and learn how to mitigate AI access risks. [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NEW CODEX FEATURES POWERED BY GPT-5 (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Codex has rolled out updates, including a new extension for editors
like Cursor and VSCode, an enhanced CLI for local use, and seamless
management of local and cloud tasks. GitHub code reviews can now be
driven by Codex, all integrated into existing ChatGPT plans and backed
by GPT-5. 

 THE TOP 100 [GEN AI] CONSUMER APPS (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Gen AI ecosystem is starting to stabilize. There were only 11 new
names on Andreessen Horowitz's most recent Top 100 Gen AI Consumer
Apps list, compared to 17 newcomers in the March ranking. There were
significantly more mobile newcomers as app stores have cracked down on
ChatGPT copycats, opening up room for more original apps. ChatGPT is
still the leading general assistant, but Google, Grok, and Meta are
closing the gap. More on the top Gen AI consumer apps is available in
the article. 

 NVIDIA REPORTS RECORD SALES AS THE AI BOOM CONTINUES (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, reported $46.7 billion in
revenue this quarter, a 56% increase compared to the same period last
year. AI-dominated data center business largely fuelled that growth.

 BUILDING AGENTS FOR SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS: A DEEP DIVE INTO
LIGHTWEIGHT AI (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Small language models are models ranging from 270M to 32B parameters
that run efficiently on CPUs or modest GPUs. They offer immense
potential: privacy through local deployment, predictable costs, and
full control thanks to open weights. They also present unique
challenges that require a shift in how agent architectures are
designed. This article reviews lessons learned from hands-on
experimentation, debugging, and optimizing of inference pipelines for
small language models. 

 MALLEABLE SOFTWARE WILL EAT THE SAAS WORLD (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The winners in the AI era will be the tools that adapt to users.
Large language models shift the focus from designing the solution to
defining the problem. They can handle the 'how' aspects of the
problem, so you just need to describe what you want in plain language.
The future belongs to software that bends without breaking.

 HOW CLOUDFLARE RUNS MORE AI MODELS ON FEWER GPUS: A TECHNICAL
DEEP-DIVE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Omni is an internal platform at Cloudflare built for running and
managing AI models on its edge nodes. It can spawn and manage multiple
models on a single machine and GPU using lightweight isolation. Omni
makes it easy and efficient to run many small and/or low-volume
models. This article looks at how Cloudflare uses Omni to run more
models on every node in its network, improving model availability,
minimizing latency, and reducing power consumed by idle GPUs. 

 STOP “VIBE TESTING” YOUR LLMS. IT'S TIME FOR REAL EVALS (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Stax is an experimental developer tool designed to streamline the LLM
evaluation lifecycle. Evals give developers clear metrics to help
understand what's actually better, so developers don't have to waste
hours 'vibe testing' every time they try a new model or tweak a
prompt. Stax empowers developers to rigorously test their AI stacks to
help make data-driven decisions. It allows developers to easily define
their own criteria and build a custom autorater. 

 ENVIRONMENTS HUB: A COMMUNITY HUB TO SCALE RL TO OPEN AGI (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A new open-source platform is providing dozens of reinforcement
learning environments to support “open AGI” and inviting
contributors to add more.

 OH GOODY, THE 'FIRST KNOWN AI-POWERED RANSOMWARE' HAS BEEN
DISCOVERED, AND IT 'MAY EXFILTRATE DATA, ENCRYPT IT, OR POTENTIALLY
DESTROY IT' (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 PromptLock is a newly discovered proof-of-concept ransomware that
uses OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b model to generate code to exfiltrate data,
encrypt it, and potentially destroy it. It uses the Ollama API to
generate malicious Lua scripts on the fly, which it then executes. The
ransomware runs locally, which allows it to avoid detection more
easily as it doesn't use any online resources. 

 OPENAI AND ANTHROPIC SHARE SAFETY ACCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI and Anthropic allowed each other internal API access for joint
AI safety testing, aiming to uncover blind spots in their model
evaluations.

 GOOGLE IRONWOOD TPU SWINGS FOR REASONING MODEL LEADERSHIP AT HOT
CHIPS 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Ironwood is the first Google TPU explicitly designed for large-scale
AI inference. 

 CRITIQUES OF WORLD MODELS (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The primary goal of a world model is to simulate all actionable
possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. 

 AN UNUSUAL CONSEQUENCE OF AI CODING (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This developer found that they stopped listening to music when they
replaced their old coding process with prompt-crafting. 

 WE ARE STILL UNABLE TO SECURE LLMS FROM MALICIOUS INPUTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 All AIs working in adversarial environments are vulnerable to prompt
injections, and the people developing these technologies are
pretending this isn't a problem. 

 DOES GENERATIVE AI FACILITATE INVESTOR TRADING? (18 MINUTE READ) [21]


 Researchers used ChatGPT outages as a natural experiment to measure
AI's impact on financial markets, finding significant drops in trading
volume and reduced price informativeness when the service went down.
