 ADD 3RD-PARTY ACTIONS TO YOUR AI PRODUCT IN MINUTES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your AI features aren't truly useful unless they can automate work
for users across their entire workflow.

For sales teams, this could mean enabling your AI agent to SEND_EMAIL
or UPDATE_CRM_RECORDS.

For support teams - QUERY_CRM or CREATE_TICKET

For project managers - UPDATE_TASK or SEND_SLACK_MESSAGE.

Instead of having engineering build & optimize each function tool, use
ActionKit [4].

It's a single API to give your AI agent 1000+ integration actions [4].

 CAST4 SINGLE IMAGE TO 3D SCENE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Creating a full 3D scene from a single RGB image is challenging. This
method proposes an algorithm that gets robust estimates for indoor
scenes by using a fairly complicated stream of estimation and semantic
guessing. 

 LIGHT THINKER (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This work aims to compress really verbose reasoning traces into
smaller and more compact representations to save context space while
still being effective at steering the model. 

 UNCERTAINTY IN NEURAL NETWORKS (31 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DeepMind researchers propose Delta Variances, a family of algorithms
designed to efficiently estimate epistemic uncertainty in large neural
networks.
