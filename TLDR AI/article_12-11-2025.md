HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI READIES CHATGPT GROUP CHATS WITH CUSTOM CONTROLS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A new Group Chats feature for ChatGPT, currently in development,
enables multiple users to join a shared conversation and interact both
with each other and with the AI in a single chat feed. Groups will be
able to customize the system prompt for discussions and manage when
the AI should respond. The feature will likely be rolling out as part
of the upcoming seasonal update cycle. 

 INTRODUCING SCRIBE V2 REALTIME (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Scribe v2 Realtime is a low-latency Speech to Text model that
delivers live transcription in under 150 milliseconds. It supports
over 90 languages and is specifically built for agentic use cases. The
model achieves 93.5% accuracy across 30 commonly used European and
Asian languages. Scribe v2 Realtime can be accessed through
ElevenLabs' API or directly within ElevenLabs Agents. 

 YANN LECUN REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO LEAVE META (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta's chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is reportedly preparing to
leave the company to start his own venture focused on world models.
His departure comes amid a broader AI reorganization at Meta,
including the formation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, and internal
tensions following shifts in AI development strategy. 

 BYTEDANCE UNVEILS CHINA'S MOST AFFORDABLE AI CODING AGENT AT JUST
US$1.30 A MONTH (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Doubao-Seed-Code model is a coding agent priced at 40 yuan a
month, with a special launch price of 9.9 yuan (US$1.30) for the first
month. The new model set a state-of-the-art record on the SWE-Bench
Verified test. It supports popular development tools like veCLI,
Cursor, and Cline, and is compatible with Anthropic's API. The model
can process up to 256,000 words per query and can handle complex
codebases.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BUILD TIMES FOR GIGAWATT-SCALE DATA CENTERS CAN BE 2 YEARS OR LESS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Gigawatt-scale AI data centers are massive undertakings that require
extensive permitting, construction, and power infrastructure. Many
hyperscalers have concrete plans to build data centers at this scale
in two years or less. The time from starting construction to achieving
one gigawatt of total facility power ranges from 1 to 3.6 years. The
first gigawatt-scale datacenters are expected to come online in early
2026. 

 HOW TO TRAIN AN LLM: PART 1 (27 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post walks through how a researcher set up basic pre-training
infrastructure and trained a 1B Llama 3-style model on 8xH100s. The
resulting model is far from state-of-the-art, but it provides a clear
working implementation that can be abstracted further. 

 RL ENVIRONMENTS AND THE HIERARCHY OF AGENTIC CAPABILITIES (23 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Researchers dropped nine frontier AI models into a simulated
workplace environment and gave them 150 jobs to do. Most of the AIs
were barely coherent, and even the best lacked common sense. The
experiment showed how models must acquire more fundamental
capabilities before we can even begin to discuss how well they perform
common-sense reasoning in real environments. Finding out whether
common sense reasoning is a set of identifiable, trainable sub-skills
or an emergent property of large-scale real-world training will help
shape the next stage of AI development. 

 WHY SUDOKU VARIANTS REMAIN A GRAND CHALLENGE IN AI REASONING (15
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Modified versions of Sudoku test an AI's creativity and ability to
strategize around rulesets that don't appear in its training data,
unlike fixed-rule games like Chess or Go. GPT-5 is the first LLM to
solve a 9x9 variant by simultaneously coordinating four constraint
types (standard rules, region sum lines, XV pairs, and Roman numeral
cages), but it still only succeeded 20% of the time. 

 FROM WORDS TO WORLDS: SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AI'S NEXT FRONTIER (18
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Current LLMs are wordsmiths in the dark—eloquent but inexperienced.
They lack a core cognitive function of humans: spatial intelligence.
"World models" solve this by generating geometrically and physically
consistent simulated worlds, processing multimodal inputs like images
and gestures, and predicting next states based on actions. If
successful, the technology would be a step change for robotics, video
models, and drug discovery.

 HERE'S WHAT'S NEXT IN AGENTIC CODING (28 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The speed of development in the agentic coding space has been
eye-wateringly meteoric. There have been eleven paradigm shifts in ten
months. Next year will be when polished harnesses meet new age models.
Context management is everything. The degree to which next year's
tools will translate intent into working code will be mind-blowing. 

 NESTED LEARNING REPRODUCTION (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This repository contains a high-fidelity reproduction of Google's
Nested Learning architecture. It is fully open-source and uv-managed.
A copy of Google DeepMind's original Nested Learning Paper is included
in the repository. 

 INTRODUCTION TO AGENTS (3 HOUR READ) [18] 

 AI is changing from models that excel at passive, discrete tasks to a
new class of software capable of autonomous problem-solving and task
execution. The new frontier is built around AI agents. This page
contains a whitepaper written by Google researchers that introduces
readers to AI agents. AI agents are complete applications that plan
and take actions to achieve goals. They combine models' ability to
reason with the practical ability to act.

 THREE AI MEGADEALS ARE BREAKING NEW GROUND ON WALL STREET (10 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Some of the biggest AI infrastructure deals that Meta, OpenAI, and
xAI are part of involve innovative, and in some cases risky, funding
schemes. These tech titans are offering sweeteners in their deals
because they need to offload risk as the cost of the AI arms race
soars. While banks and fund managers are writing big checks for now,
many are worried about how the complicated deals will perform when the
AI frenzy calms down. This article takes a close look at some of the
biggest AI megadeals so far. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES USE CASE LIBRARY (20 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Anthropic released a searchable library of 45+ practical use cases
demonstrating Claude's capabilities across professional work,
marketing, education, research, and personal tasks, each with specific
prompts and step-by-step guidance.
