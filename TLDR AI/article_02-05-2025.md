 WHY WOULD AI COMPANIES USE HUMAN-LEVEL AI TO DO ALIGNMENT RESEARCH?
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI companies might not prioritize alignment bootstrapping when they
have human-level AI, mirroring their current focus on advancing
capabilities with human researchers over safety efforts. This trend
could lead to a dangerous disparity where AI capabilities
significantly outpace alignment, increasing existential risks. To
avert this, AI companies should already be emphasizing safety over
capabilities to prove their commitment to responsible development. 

 WHY DEVELOPERS SHOULD CARE ABOUT GENERATIVE AI (EVEN IF THEY AREN'T
AI EXPERTS) (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Generative AI, like GitHub Copilot and Claude, is set to transform
software development by enhancing productivity and automating routine
tasks. While AI tools promise efficiency gains, they won't replace
human developers, who are crucial for creative vision, quality
assurance, and understanding complex requirements. Developers should
embrace these tools to augment their skills and keep pace with
technological advancements.
