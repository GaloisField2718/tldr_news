HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INVESTORS PREDICT AI IS COMING FOR LABOR IN 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 AI could automate 11.7% of jobs, prompting employers to reduce
entry-level positions and justify layoffs. Enterprise VCs foresee
significant AI impact on the workforce in 2026, with companies
shifting budgets from labor to AI investments. While AI proponents
argue it enhances productivity, concerns persist about job automation
leading to increased unemployment. 

 ELON MUSK ENVISIONS HUMANOID ROBOTS EVERYWHERE. CHINA MAY BE THE
FIRST TO MAKE IT A REALITY (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Elon Musk highlights humanoid robots for Tesla's future, but Chinese
companies may lead with mass production in 2026. China focuses on
robotics to tackle demographic and economic challenges, employing its
manufacturing strengths despite chip restrictions. Analysts expect
China's robot market to surpass the US initially, though challenges
like AI limitations and high costs persist.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE MEMORY WARS: WHY AI'S FUTURE DEPENDS ON 16-HI HBM (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 AI is hitting a memory bottleneck: massive models need terabytes of
fast memory. NVIDIA's 16-Hi HBM orders, 3D-stacked SRAM, and Groq deal
aim to fix this, enabling near-instant inference and huge model
scales. The result: AI can finally reach its potential in chat,
robotics, and scientific discovery, shifting the limit from hardware
to imagination. 

 HOW AI IS RESHAPING ENTRY-LEVEL TECH JOBS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI reshapes entry-level tech roles by automating routine tasks,
leading to a 25% decline in hiring at major tech firms. Despite a drop
in programmer jobs, positions like information security analysts and
AI engineers are growing. Education must adapt, emphasizing AI
proficiency and experiential learning, while apprenticeship models
offer practical experience and bridge skill gaps.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 END-TO-END TEST-TIME TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [8] 

 E2E is a long-context language modeling approach that reframes the
task as continual learning. Using standard Transformers with
sliding-window attention, the model learns at test time via next-token
prediction and meta-learns during training for better initialization. 

 FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE IN LLMS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FinCDM proposes a cognitive diagnosis framework for evaluating
financial LLMs at the skill level, moving beyond single-score
benchmarks. 

 LMCACHE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 LMCache is an open-source KV-cache acceleration layer for LLM serving
that stores and reuses transformer key‑value cache chunks (across
GPU, CPU, disk, and Redis), enabling 3–10× faster response times
and significantly reduced GPU compute under long-context and
multi-turn scenarios.

 THE US ARMY IS PREPARING TO TRAIN ITS FIRST AI SPECIALISTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The US Army will start training AI/ML officer specialists through its
Volunteer Transfer Incentive Program beginning in January. Training
will focus on building, deploying, and maintaining AI systems,
leveraging commercial AI solutions. This initiative aims to develop
in-house expertise for efficient AI integration across warfighting
functions. 

 HARVARD'S CS 249R (COURSE) [12] 

 An open-source textbook for Harvard's CS249R course on deep learning
and reinforcement learning with practical examples and lectures. 

 13 TIMES AI ACTUALLY DELIVERED (19 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AI in marketing helps streamline tasks like image generation, ad
optimization, and content creation without replacing human creativity
and strategy. Brands like Heads or Tails Pup and Very Ireland saw
significant sales and engagement boosts by leveraging AI for design
and title optimization, while maintaining human oversight. AI has
proven valuable for fast, cost-effective content production, yet
relying solely on its outputs can mislead consumers, highlighting the
need for strategic human intervention.
