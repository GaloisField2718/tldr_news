HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELON MUSK'S XAI LANDS $6B IN NEW CASH TO FUEL AI AMBITIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 xAI raised $6 billion in Series C, doubling its valuation to $45
billion. The company aims to accelerate infrastructure and product
development, using models like Grok to enhance capabilities on X. xAI
continues to expand amidst legal challenges with OpenAI, leveraging
data from Musk's ventures and planning further fundraising next year. 

 SRIRAM KRISHNAN NAMED TRUMP'S SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR FOR AI (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Sriram Krishnan, former a16z general partner, will serve as senior
policy advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy under Trump. He will coordinate AI policy across the
government and work closely with David Sacks. Krishnan's background
includes leadership roles at Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook, and he
has a strong relationship with Elon Musk. 

 OPENAI TRAINED O1 AND O3 TO 'THINK' ABOUT ITS SAFETY POLICY (7 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 OpenAI enhanced reasoning and safety features in its new AI model
family, o3, using a novel "deliberative alignment" process. This
method improves the alignment of AI model responses with OpenAI's
safety values by referencing those values during inference without
human-written data. Deliberative alignment, combined with advanced
techniques like synthetic data and reinforcement learning, makes o3
OpenAI's safest model yet. It is set to release in 2025.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 UNDERSTANDING MEDICAL DECISION-MAKING (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MedDec is a dataset that helps improve the extraction of medical
decisions from clinical notes. It covers eleven different diseases.
The dataset is annotated with ten types of medical decisions. 

 LLMS WILL ALWAYS HALLUCINATE, AND WE NEED TO LIVE WITH THIS (30
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As large language models become more ubiquitous across domains, it
becomes important to examine their inherent limitations critically.
Hallucinations in language models are not just occasional errors, but
an inevitable feature of these systems. 

 HIGH-SPEED ROBOTICS SIMULATOR (33 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ManiSkill3 is an advanced, open-source robotics simulator designed
for scalable learning and manipulation tasks. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 A TOOLKIT FOR SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 EmoBox is a comprehensive toolkit designed to address common issues
in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). It provides a multilingual,
multi-corpus benchmark for both intra-corpus and cross-corpus
settings, enabling easier comparison and reproduction of SER models. 

 CANCER DETECTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SAM-Swin is a model for detecting laryngo-pharyngeal cancer (LPC)
that uses advanced features from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). 

 HOW TO GET REAL GPU UTILIZATION METRICS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Nvidia-smi shows a measure of GPU utilization but it is the amount of
time where at least one kernel is running, not a full measure of GPU
usage. This work by Stas shows how you can get actual FLOP usage. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SO MANY TOKENS, SO LITTLE TIME: INTRODUCING A FASTER, MORE FLEXIBLE
BYTE-PAIR TOKENIZER (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 GitHub has released a new open-source byte-pair tokenizer that
improves speed and flexibility for large language models like Copilot,
scaling better with linear complexity. This tokenizer addresses
limitations of existing BPE algorithms by efficiently supporting
dynamic token counts for real-time text operations. It outperforms
popular libraries like tiktoken and Hugging Face in benchmarks,
significantly boosting performance for various applications. 

 SCALING LAWS – O1 PRO ARCHITECTURE, REASONING TRAINING
INFRASTRUCTURE, ORION AND CLAUDE 3.5 OPUS “FAILURES” (36 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 There's skepticism around AI scaling laws, citing challenges like
data exhaustion and hardware limits, but major AI players like Amazon,
Meta, and OpenAI are continuing massive investments in data center and
custom silicon capabilities, signaling their faith in ongoing scaling
potential. New paradigms beyond pre-training, such as synthetic data,
Reinforcement Learning, and advanced fine-tuning, are helping overcome
traditional scaling barriers. OpenAI's o1 release demonstrates that
increasing test-time compute, leveraging multi-datacenter training,
and exploring novel scaling dimensions can significantly enhance AI
model capabilities. 

 HOW CLAUDE USES AI TO IDENTIFY NEW THREATS (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic's Clio tool identified a coordinated effort to generate SEO
spam using its chatbot, Claude, leading to the termination of the
spammers' access. Clio uses machine learning to detect emerging
threats and highlight unusual chatbot usage, assisting Anthropic's
trust and safety team. The company encourages other AI labs to adopt
similar monitoring strategies to address potential harms while
exploring diverse user applications.
