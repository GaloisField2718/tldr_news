 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION THAT UNIFIES EXPERIMENTATION,
PROD, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to be more than a never-ending work in progress, and that
means enabling no-code, low-code, and pro-code development without IT
gatekeepers standing in the way. Yet that doesn't mean governance goes
out the window.

Airia is the enterprise AI platform [4] built to drive AI adoption by
unifying innovation and security. Teams at Stryker, BuzzFeed, and
ArcelorMittal use it to:

 	* Test prompts, LLMs, and agent variants in safe, prod-like
environments 
 	* End AI anxiety by controlling agent sprawl and implementing
automatic guardrails [4]
 	* Discover risks, orchestrate agents, and monitor threats in one
place

Get a demo [4] and make AI adoption a reality

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE SONNET 4.6 (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.6, upgrading coding,
computer-use, planning, long-context reasoning, and knowledge-work
performance while keeping Sonnet pricing unchanged. Sonnet 4.6 also
introduced a 1M-token context window in beta and is now the default
model for Free and Pro users in Claude's apps. 

 PROMPT-BASED REVISIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NotebookLM has rolled out Prompt-Based Revisions, a feature that lets
users tweak, tailor, and tune slides just by prompting the revisions
they want. It currently supports PPTX, with Google Slides support
coming soon. A video demo of the feature is available in the thread. 

 MISTRAL TO ACQUIRE KOYEB TO BUILD OUT ITS AI CLOUD STACK (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Mistral AI agreed to buy serverless deployment startup Koyeb in its
first acquisition, positioning Koyeb's platform and team as a core
component of Mistral Compute.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 ON DWARKESH PATEL'S 2026 PODCAST WITH ELON MUSK AND OTHER RECENT ELON
MUSK THINGS (42 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Elon Musk recently went on a podcast to discuss alignment, AI data
centers in space, robots, China, and more. Musk is very gung-ho about
data centers in space, robots, and making his own fabs. He plans to
make virtual humans and robots to turn on an 'infinity money glitch'.
Otherwise, China will win - they're already more productive. 

 OPENAI'S ACQUISITION OF OPENCLAW SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF
THE CHATGPT ERA (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 OpenAI's acquisition of OpenClaw marks a strategic shift from
conversational AI to autonomous agents capable of executing tasks.
OpenClaw's popularity stemmed from its unrestrained, robust
functionality, combining tool access, sandboxed code execution, and
integration with messaging platforms. This move signals a new phase
for enterprise AI as companies race to develop secure, deployable
versions of dynamic AI agents.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 THE WEAKEST LINK IN ENTERPRISE AI IS RARELY THE MODELS (SPONSOR) [10]


 Human judgment is the hardest part to scale. You're relying on people
to validate training data, evaluate models, review edge cases, and
enforce policies — are they judging consistently and defensibly?
Welo Data [10] builds systems that support human + AI judgment at
scale. Talk to an expert [11] 

 THE FUTURE OF DESIGN IS CODE AND CANVAS (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Figma users can now bring work from Claude Code into the platform.
They just need to install the Figma MCP, type 'Send this to Figma',
and the browser's rendered state will be automatically translated to
fully editable Figma layers. Workflows are changing, and it's easy to
get lost in the momentum of creation. The new Claude Code to Figma
Design integration aims to help designers escape that tunnel vision,
zoom out, and explore the big picture. 

 COHERE'S FAMILY OF OPEN MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cohere Labs released TinyAya-Base (3.35B) and instruction-tuned
TinyAya-Global plus regional variants, aiming for balanced quality
across ~67 languages on consumer hardware. The drop also included a
multilingual fine-tuning dataset, new benchmarks, and a technical
report for reproducible multilingual experimentation. 

 EXPERIENTIAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (18 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 ERL trains policies with an explicit attempt → feedback →
reflection → revised attempt loop, then reinforced the successful
revision back into the base model. The approach improves sparse-reward
learning and tool-using reasoning performance while keeping
deployment-time inference cost unchanged. 

 OPEN-WEB SIMULATOR FOR AGENT TRAINING (22 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 WebWorld uses a pipeline of 1M+ open-web interactions to simulate
long-horizon (30+ step) browsing tasks, paired with a multi-metric
WebWorld-Bench for intrinsic evaluation. Trajectories synthesized from
the simulator boosted downstream web-agent performance and transferred
to other domains like code, GUI, and games. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 CURSOR LAUNCHED A PLUGIN MARKETPLACE FOR AGENT INTEGRATIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Cursor added plugin support so agents could connect to external tools
and extend capabilities via packaged MCP servers, skills, subagents,
rules, and hooks. 

 META EXPANDS NVIDIA DEAL TO USE MILLIONS OF AI CHIPS IN DATA CENTER
BUILD-OUT, INCLUDING STANDALONE CPUS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta plans to use millions of Nvidia chips in its AI data centers.
The companies recently announced an expanded partnership to deliver
personal superintelligence to everyone in the world. The financial
terms of the deal have not been made public. Meta plans to spend up to
$135 billion on AI this year.
