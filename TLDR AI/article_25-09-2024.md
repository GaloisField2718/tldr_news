 THE MISSING PIECE IN YOUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO? WHY YOU SHOULD BE
LOOKING AT PRIVATE CREDIT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Private credit‚Äîi.e., loans and debt financing from non-bank
lenders‚Äîis a resilient asset class that's averaged a 12% return
globally (and 14.5% on Percent [5]). It's been popular with
institutional investors for a while, especially as it has outperformed
both stocks and bonds in the last 3 market downturns.

PERCENT [4] simplifies access to private credit investing with low
minimums (JUST $500) and shorter durations (9 MONTHS AVERAGE) through
their marketplace. Deals are available to INDIVIDUAL ACCREDITED
INVESTORS, making it one of the few places an everyday investor could
get in.
