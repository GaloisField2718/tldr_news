 A HACKER STOLE OPENAI SECRETS, RAISING FEARS THAT CHINA COULD, TOO (8
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A hacker gained access to OpenAI's internal messaging systems early
last year. They accessed details from discussions in an internal
online forum but did not get into the systems where the company houses
and builds its artificial intelligence. Details of the incident were
revealed to employees in April 2023. Executives decided not to share
the news publicly because no information about customers or partners
was stolen. It is believed that the hacker was a private individual
with no known ties to a foreign government. OpenAI did not inform the
FBI or anyone else in law enforcement about the incident. 

 FIGMA PULLS AI TOOL AFTER CRITICISM THAT IT RIPPED OFF APPLE'S DESIGN
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Figma's "Make Designs" AI feature was temporarily pulled amidst

Field attributes the similarity to third-party models and a design

content. Figma plans to ensure future AI features align with quality
standards and user privacy choices.
