 NYLAS EXTRACTAI: TURN USER EMAILS INTO STRUCTURED DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The world (still) runs on email. Invoices, product orders, travel
plans - they're all in the inbox. But unstructured data and wildly
disparate email formats make extracting the parts you need difficult.

ExtractAI by Nylas [4] is the new way to sync, filter, and extract
user data. With just a few lines of code, you can now deploy advanced
ML, NLP, and LLMs to retrieve first-party data from your users'
inboxes [4]:

 	* 92% cost savings compared to other AI / LLM tools
 	* 99.9% accuracy SLA for order data
 	* Real-time sync with no email forwarding required

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WHAT IS APPLE INTELLIGENCE, WHEN IS IT COMING AND WHO WILL GET IT? (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple introduced Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, focusing on
integrating AI features into existing apps like Mail, Messages, and
Siri. The platform uses large language models for tasks such as text
summarization and image generation, aiming for a seamless user
experience. A beta version will roll out in the U.S. this October,
with broader international support planned for 2025. 

 HERE'S HOW 7 NEWS AUDIENCE DIRECTORS ARE THINKING ABOUT GOOGLE'S AI
OVERVIEWS (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google's AI Overviews, powered by the Gemini language model, faced
heavy criticism for inaccuracies and dangerous suggestions after its
U.S. launch. Despite the backlash, Google expanded the feature to six
more countries, raising concerns among publishers about reduced
traffic and misrepresented content. AI strategists and SEO experts
emphasize the need for transparency and better citation practices to
maintain trust and traffic. 

 NEW OPEN SOURCE AI LEADER REFLECTION 70B'S PERFORMANCE QUESTIONED (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 HyperWrite's Reflection 70B, a variant of Meta's Llama 3.1 LLM, is
facing scrutiny after third-party evaluators couldn't replicate its
claimed performance. Issues were attributed to model weights being
corrupted during the upload to Hugging Face, which led to
discrepancies. The AI community awaits further responses and updates
to clarify the model's actual capabilities.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 IMITATING LANGUAGE VIA SCALABLE INVERSE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (28
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Much of modern language modeling is a specific case of imitation
learning. Fortunately, there is a depth of study in the field broadly.
This paper explores how to use inverse reinforcement learning to
imitate entire sequences instead of just tokens. The results are
promising and point in the direction of continued RL in language model
training pipelines. 

 VISUAL GENERATION WITH PROXY TOKEN DIFFUSION TRANSFORMER (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Proxy Token Diffusion Transformer reduces redundant computations in
diffusion transformers by using fewer representative tokens for
attention. 

 3D OBJECT DETECTION FOR INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UniDet3D is a powerful 3D object detection model trained on multiple
indoor datasets.

 OXFORD DICTIONARIES API: READY-TO-USE LANGUAGE DATA IN 35 LANGUAGES
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Get reliable, up-to-date monolingual and bilingual data in an
accessible, scalable environment. Develop for a range of communities
with large quantities of quality data [11] from widely used and
digitally under-represented languages ‚Äî Hindi, Latvian, Portuguese,
Swahili, and many more. Watch the Oxford Dictionaries API tour [11] 

 FAST 3D RECONSTRUCTION FROM MULTIPLE IMAGES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A great tool that uses Mast3r and some clever optimizations to
reconstruct 3D scenes from a few 2D images. 

 EXPERIMENTAL GPU META PROGRAMMING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Image processing and cropping that can be run on the GPU. 

 3D SCENE UNDERSTANDING (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers conducted a study comparing seven different visual
encoding models for 3D scene understanding and found that the best
model depends on the task. DINOv2 performed the best overall. Video
models excelled in object-level tasks and diffusion models were best
for geometric tasks. Language-pretrained models had surprising
limitations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HANDWRITING GENERATION WITH A SINGLE SAMPLE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A One-DM model that generates handwritten text mimicking any style
using just a single sample. 

 DIFFUSION IS SPECTRAL AUTOREGRESSION (27 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Diffusion models and autoregressive models are fundamentally similar,
both using iterative refinement processes. Using Fourier transform
techniques, this author shows how diffusion models operate like
approximate autoregression in the frequency domain, particularly for
visual data. This insight highlights potential directions for unifying
generative modeling approaches across different data types. 

 WHY WE FEAR DIVERSE INTELLIGENCE LIKE AI (18 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The rise of AI and diverse intelligences challenges outdated
distinctions between "real beings" and machines. Instead of focusing
solely on AI, people should understand and ethically engage with
diverse cognitive systems, including bioengineered, robotic, and
hybrid entities. Expanding our definitions of intelligence and
compassion will help navigate the ethical landscape of emerging
technologies.
