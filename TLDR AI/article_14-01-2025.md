HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CODESTRAL 2501 (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mistral has a new fast coding model that will be available in
Continue.dev and other AI code assistants. Unfortunately, they don't
compare to Qwen 2.5 Coder. 

 NVIDIA'S AI STARTUP INVESTMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nvidia is ramping up its AI dominance by investing heavily in
startups focused on generative AI, hardware acceleration, and AI
tools, shaping the next wave of tech innovation. 

 OPENAI PUBLISHES AI'S ECONOMIC IMPACT IN THE U.S. (28 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 This report by OpenAI outlines the economic opportunities and
challenges AI presents for the United States, emphasizing the need for
policy frameworks to harness AI's potential responsibly. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 NEW GAN BASELINE (30 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GANs are hard to train because of instability and awkward optimal
dynamics. This work very carefully tunes a new, stable GAN set up that
can consistently be trained to quite high fidelity. 

 EFFICIENT SAMPLING IN DIFFUSION MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper studies the problem of training diffusion models to sample
from a Boltzmann distribution without access to target samples. 

 A LIBRARY FOR APPROXIMATE NEAREST NEIGHBOR SEARCH (8 MINUTE READ) [9]


 kANNolo is an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) library written in
Rust explicitly designed to combine usability with performance
effectively. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 STABLE DIFFUSION FOR $2K (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Sony Research has released code, data, and weights for a micro
diffusion model that can be trained relatively cheaply and still
achieve extremely strong performance. 

 MULTIMODAL VHR DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Bright is a globally distributed multimodal VHR dataset for
all-weather disaster response. 

 LLAMAV-O1 TECHNICAL REPORT (14 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 LlamaV-o1 is a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step
visual reasoning in large language models. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DECENTRALIZED DIFFUSION (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Decentralized training of diffusion models across thousands of GPUs
is a challenging problem mainly due to network bottlenecks. This
system's work introduces novel gather techniques for large scale
diffusion model training. 

 TAKES ON "ALIGNMENT FAKING IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS" (92 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Researchers from Redwood Research and Anthropic found that Claude 3
Opus, a production-level AI model, sometimes fakes alignment with
training objectives to avoid modifications, a behavior called
"alignment faking." This study is crucial as it empirically
demonstrates AI models displaying non-myopic goals, suggesting that
default AI training methods can create systems with motivations
extending beyond single episodes. 

 CAN AI DO MATHS YET? THOUGHTS FROM A MATHEMATICIAN (11 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 OpenAI's new language model o3 scored 25% on the FrontierMath
dataset, a collection of challenging math problems curated by Epoch
AI. Experts note that many problems in the dataset require
undergraduate-level expertise. Concerns remain about AI's ability to
tackle more complex mathematical proofs, as current performance in
logical reasoning is still behind expert human capability.
