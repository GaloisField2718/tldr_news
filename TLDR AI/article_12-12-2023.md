 PICASSO‚ÄôS $139 MILLION SALE REVEALS UNEXPECTED INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITY¬†(SPONSOR) [5] 

 Just last month, an iconic Picasso painting shattered expectations
when it sold for $139 million at auction. Impressive, considering it
was purchased for _around $1 million _in the late 1960‚Äôs.¬†
But there‚Äôs a surprising group of investors also celebrating this
sale: 61,000 everyday users of one investment platform [5].¬†

Why? Because that platform, Masterworks, enables anyone to invest in
paintings by artists like Picasso and Banksy [5] for just a fraction
of the cost. This way, not only the billionaires of the world can
benefit from the art market.¬†
