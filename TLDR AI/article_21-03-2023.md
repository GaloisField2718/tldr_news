HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

RUNWAY ANNOUNCES GEN-2 (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://research.runwayml.com/gen2?utm_source=tldrai] 

Runway announces Gen-2, a multimodal AI system that can generate
realistic videos from text. There are 4 different modes you can use
Gen-2 in: text to video, image to video, text + image to video
(generate a video using a driving image and a text prompt),
stylization (video to video), and storyboard (turn mockups into fully
stylized and animated renders). Check out the examples on the website
like ‚Äúaerial drone footage of a mountain range‚Äù and ‚Äúlate
afternoon sun peeking through the window of a New York City loft.‚Äù 

30B INSTRUCTION TUNED MODEL (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://abuqader.substack.com/p/releasing-alpaca-30b?utm_source=tldrai]


Following the same formula as the alpaca models, we can use parameter
efficient fine tuning with a cleaned version of the instruction data
set from Stanford to tune the 30 billion parameter llama model to be
better at following instructions. 

STABLE DIFFUSION REIMAGINE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-reimagine?utm_source=tldrai]


Stability AI announces Stable Diffusion Reimagine, a new Clipdrop tool
that allows users to generate multiple variations of a single image
without limits. No need for complex prompts ‚Äî users can simply
upload an image into the algorithm to create as many variations as
they want.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

CODEPS: ONLINE LEARNING FOR PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10147?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes a solution to the challenge of robotic navigation
in new environments by introducing CoDEPS, a continual learning
approach that utilizes experience replay and domain mixing to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting and adapt to changing conditions. The proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art results and addresses the limited
storage capacity of robotic systems. 

LION: IMPLICIT VISION PROMPT TUNING (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09992?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper proposes LION, an efficient vision model that addresses the
heavy computational costs of vision Transformers by using deep
implicit models with stable memory costs. LION only inserts two
equilibrium implicit layers in the pre-trained main backbone and
prunes parameters according to the lottery hypothesis, reducing up to
11.5% of training parameter numbers while achieving higher performance
than state-of-the-art baseline VPT on a wide range of datasets,
especially under challenging scenes. 

DIFFUSIONRET: GENERATIVE TEXT-VIDEO RETRIEVAL WITH DIFFUSION MODEL (11
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09867?utm_source=tldrai] 

The paper introduces DiffusionRet, a diffusion-based text-video
retrieval framework that models the correlation between text and video
as their joint probability, p(candidates, query), from a generative
viewpoint. DiffusionRet optimizes the generator through generation
loss and the feature extractor through contrastive loss, leveraging
both generative and discriminative methods to achieve superior
performance on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks,
even in out-domain retrieval settings, and bringing fundamental
insights into the related fields.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

TRANSFORMER REINFORCEMENT LEARNING V0.4.1 RELEASED (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/releases/tag/v0.4.1?utm_source=tldrai]


Now with Pytorch 2.0 support, Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning, and
other quality of life improvements TRL is becoming a top competitor
for RL(*)F type tuning tasks for language models. 

WHICH DATA MADE MY MODEL SMARTER? (26 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08114?utm_source=tldrai] 

Instead of using an additive scalar score to determine how much
influence a data instance has on final model performance, what if we
used a full training simulator? This enables counter-factual
exploration around dataset construction and long term training
performance. This method tends to underestimate performance, but does
a good job of capturing general dynamics for large language model
training runs. 

LANGFLOW (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow?utm_source=tldrai] 

A visual graph based editor for LangChain that runs in the browser.

HOW GPT MAY AFFECT THE LABOR MARKET (40 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130?utm_source=tldrai] 

While GPT models may impact labor markets, the effect is not uniform
across jobs. A preliminary look suggests physically active and
mentally creative jobs are less likely to be affected by large
language models. Not the most convincing methodology, but a good step
at this early juncture to understand what our economic future might
look like. 

DUOLINGO AND OPENAI (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/customer-stories/duolingo?utm_source=tldrai] 

Duolingo has introduced two new features powered by OpenAI's GPT-4:
Role Play, an AI conversation partner, and Explain my Answer, which
provides contextual feedback on mistakes, in a new subscription tier
called Duolingo Max. Duolingo turned to GPT-4 after finding that GPT-3
could not confidently handle the complex automated aspects of chats.
The team sees the potential of GPT-4 to provide a more effective and
engaging learning experience than ever before, which should improve
learning outcomes, and it has simplified the entire engineering
process, making it faster to bring new features to users. 

OPENAI CEO, CTO ON RISKS AND HOW AI WILL RESHAPE SOCIETY (21 MINUTE
VIDEO) [https://youtu.be/540vzMlf-54?utm_source=tldrai] 

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) and Mira Murati (CTO) talk about the impact AI
and AGI will have on society in an interview with ABC. Altman says
it‚Äôs important that they‚Äôre testing their AI through products in
the hands of real users, and making mistakes while the stakes are low.
