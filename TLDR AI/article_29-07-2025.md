 CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLG BILLING MODEL FOR YOUR AI TOOL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The new wave of AI tools leads with PLG. If you're not offering an
easy way into your product, you're not gonna make it. But being
overly-generous with expensive inference and API calls can jeopardize
your business's viability.

Metronome's new blog [4] offers a framework for choosing between 5
different PLG billing models [4] — PayGo, threshold billing, prepaid
credits, and more — based on company safeguards vs customer adoption
barriers.

The blog also looks at an example of a hybrid billing model from
Snowflake and dives into the importance of using real-time signals to
prevent revenue leakage and customer churn.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 COPILOT MODE IN MICROSOFT EDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft introduced Copilot Mode in Edge, an experimental AI-driven
feature designed to transform traditional web browsing. It assists
users by predicting next steps, summarizing content, and reducing tab
overload to streamline interaction with the web. 

 GROK WILL GET INFINITE IMAGE GEN AND VIDEO GEN WITH SOUNDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 xAI is preparing to introduce several major updates to its Grok app.
One substantial addition is the Imagine feature, which unlocks Grok's
new generative AI models for images and videos. The relatively few
restrictions on Grok's image and video generation models could spark
viral use once rollout widens. There is no firm launch date, but it is
likely xAI will time the rollout to coincide with the release of
GPT-5. 

 TESLA $16.5B DEAL WITH SAMSUNG (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tesla secured a $16.5 billion agreement with Samsung to manufacture
its AI6 chips at a new Texas facility. 

 CHINA'S LATEST AI MODEL CLAIMS TO BE EVEN CHEAPER TO USE THAN
DEEPSEEK (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Startup Z.ai (formerly Zhipu) launched GLM-4.5, claiming it costs
less to operate than DeepSeek due to its smaller size and ability to
decompose tasks into sub-goals. The startup, backed by the Chinese
government, previously gained OpenAI's attention for securing
significant contracts in China despite competition from larger firms.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE LEVERS OF POLITICAL PERSUASION WITH CONVERSATIONAL AI (23 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Researchers tested 19 LLMs across 76,977 participants and found that
specialized post-training techniques boosted AI persuasiveness by up
to 51%, far exceeding gains from simply using larger models. The most
effective strategy was prompting models to deploy dense factual
information, but this came with a troubling tradeoff: the most
persuasive AI conversations were the most inaccurate. 

 DEEPSEEK ALL-IN-ONE MACHINES SEE MARKET COLLAPSE AFTER INITIAL HYPE
(14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Despite international reports of China's rapid nationwide DeepSeek
deployment, the reality behind the hype reveals a struggling market
for specialized "all-in-one machines" — hardware appliances
pre-loaded with DeepSeek models that allow private deployment to meet
regulatory requirements. Consultation requests have plummeted from
hundreds to just ten daily since April, with almost no repeat
customers according to Chinese sources. 

 AGENTS LAG BEHIND AI 2027'S SCHEDULE (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI 2027's progress on developing advanced agents lags behind its
projected timeline. The delay affects plans for deploying
sophisticated AI systems. This may impact timelines for AI integration
across various industries.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 A NEW KIND OF AGENT FOR ENTERPRISE WORK (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Writer's Action Agent [13] is a researcher, a strategist, a data
scientist, and a programmer. Give it a goal and it puts together a
multi-phase plan, then executes to deliver exactly what you need:
reports, slide decks, spreadsheets, and more. Give Action Agent a
project to tackle today -- try the beta for free. [13] 

 SCALING LAWS FOR MOE MODELS (28 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Efficiency Leverage (EL) is a metric that quantifies the
computational advantage of Mixture-of-Experts models. Based on
experiments with over 300 models, these authors present scaling laws
that predict EL using MoE configuration parameters. 

 WE BUILT THE SECURITY LAYER MCP ALWAYS NEEDED (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 mcp-context-protector is a security wrapper for LLM apps using the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). It defends against line jumping attacks
with features designed to help expose malicious server behavior. The
wrapper proxies tool calls and other operations to the downstream
server, making it compatible with any MCP server and any MCP-compliant
host app. Developers are able to add any sort of control suited to
their organization's use case. 

 SIX PRINCIPLES FOR PRODUCTION AI AGENTS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 System design and proper software engineering are required for
building effective AI agents. Developers need to focus on clear
instructions, lean context management, robust tool interfaces, and
automated validation loops instead of finding a silver bullet of a
great prompt or an advanced framework. Error analysis is paramount -
models should be used to help developers understand where agents fail
so that those failure modes can be systematically addressed. The goal
is to create reliable and recoverable agents that fail gracefully and
can be improved iteratively.

 HARMONIC, THE ROBINHOOD CEO'S AI MATH STARTUP, LAUNCHES AN AI CHATBOT
APP (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Harmonic's AI model, Aristotle, offers 'hallucination-free' answers
for questions involving mathematical reasoning. The startup is focused
on creating mathematical superintelligence and eventually wants to
help users in all fields that rely on math. It will eventually release
an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for
consumers. Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025
International Math Olympiad through a formal test, meaning the
problems were translated into a machine-readable format. 

 AI IS EATING THE INTERNET (13 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Ads gave us an Internet that was mostly free and open. AI has
introduced a new problem for content creators: a new wave of bots
crawling sites for content to train AI, often taking value and
offering nothing in return. This is causing content creators to put up
walled gardens or bot protections. The prevalence of AI-generated
content is causing people to seek more authentic spaces, resulting in
a cozy web of niche communities.
