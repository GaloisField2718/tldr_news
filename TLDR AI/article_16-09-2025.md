HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-5 CODEX OPTIMIZED FOR AGENTIC CODING (11 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI upgraded its Codex agent with GPT-5-Codex, a new model capable
of dynamically allocating compute time per task, ranging from seconds
to hours, leading to better performance on complex coding benchmarks. 

 OPENAI PROJECTS REVENUE SHARING WITH MICROSOFT TO DROP FROM 20% TO 8%
BY 2030 (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 As part of restructuring into a for-profit company, OpenAI said it
expects to keep an additional $50 billion by reducing its revenue
share with Microsoft, which was originally introduced as a concession
in exchange for exclusive use of Microsoft's cloud servers. 

 REVE LAUNCHES AI-POWERED PLATFORM FOR PRECISE IMAGE CREATION (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Reve has launched a new image creation platform that combines an
image creator, a drag-and-drop editor, a creative assistant, and an
API. The platform uses a unique Layout Representation to enhance
precision, bridging language and vision for seamless editing. Users
gain granular control over visual elements, enabling more intuitive
image manipulation.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SEMANTIC IDS FOR RECOMMENDER LLMS (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Instead of random hash IDs, this experiment embeds semantically
meaningful item tokens into an LLM, enabling natural language
recommendations and interpretable, chat-based interactions. 

 HARVARD'S NEW AI TOOL COULD PINPOINT TREATMENTS FOR PARKINSON'S AND
ALZHEIMER'S (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Harvard's PDGrapher AI model identifies gene-drug combinations that
could restore healthy cell states, targeting diseases like Parkinson's
and Alzheimer's. The tool accelerates drug discovery by predicting
viable pairings and providing mechanistic insights. This aligns with a
trend of using AI in biotech, where models like AlphaFold
revolutionize scientific research.

 AGENTIC AI READINESS ROADMAP BY CAMUNDA (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Are you in pilot purgatory or production-ready? This Roadmap will
help you figure out where your organization stands [10] and what it
will take to move forward. It includes a practical model to assess AI
maturity across five critical dimensions: vision, people,
architecture, delivery, and measurement. Grab a free copy. [10] 

 DISAGGREGATED INFERENCE WITH PYTORCH + VLLM (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Meta's internal collaboration with vLLM and PyTorch introduces
prefill/decode disaggregation, boosting large-scale LLM inference
performance in production with improved throughput and latency. 

 RUSTGPT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 RustGPT is a complete large language model implementation in pure
Rust with no external ML frameworks. The project demonstrates how to
build a transformer-based language model from scratch in Rust. It was
built from the ground up using only ndarray for matrix operations - no
PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Candle. The model uses a transformer-based
architecture. 

 HUMAN VIDEO FROM TEXT, IMAGE, AND AUDIO (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 HuMo unifies human-centric video generation across multimodal inputs
by introducing a new dataset and a progressive training strategy,
achieving audio-visual synchronization.

 OPENAI RAMPS UP ROBOTICS WORK IN RACE TOWARD AGI (6 MINUTE READ) [14]


 OpenAI is hiring researchers with expertise in developing AI
algorithms for controlling humanoid or other types of robots. The
company appears to be putting together a team capable of creating
systems that can be trained through teleoperation and simulation. It
has begun training AI algorithms that are better able to make sense of
the physical world to empower robots to navigate and perform tasks.
Achieving artificial general intelligence may require developing
algorithms capable of interacting with the physical world. 

 NVIDIA'S RUBIN CPX COULD FORCE AMD BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia's Rubin CPX is a specialized accelerator built specifically
for the 'prefill' stage of AI inference. It is tuned for dense compute
with far less bandwidth than a general-purpose GPU. Rubin CPX uses
less expensive GDDR7 memory and skips high-bandwidth features like HBM
and NVLink, so it is estimated to cost around a quarter as much to
manufacture as the standard Rubin R200. Its release may force industry
rivals to rethink their hardware strategies or risk falling further
behind Nvidia's lead in AI infrastructure.
