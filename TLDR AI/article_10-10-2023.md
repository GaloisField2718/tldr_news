HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

REPLIT AI FREE FOR EVERYONE (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.replit.com/ai4all?utm_source=tldrai]

Replit has its own coding assistant that runs across its products. It
is quite powerful, trained with Mosaic, and free for all user tiers. 

GOOGLE ANNOUNCES NEW GENERATIVE AI SEARCH CAPABILITIES FOR DOCTORS (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/09/google-announces-new-generative-ai-search-capabilities-for-doctors-.html?utm_source=tldrai]

Google Cloud introduced AI-enhanced search tools to streamline access
to diverse medical records for healthcare professionals. While the
technology aims to reduce administrative work, its integration is
undertaken with caution to fit seamlessly into existing workflows and
ensure HIPAA compliance. 

OPENAI LAUNCHES RESIDENCY PROGRAM WITH $210,000 ANNUAL SALARY (3
MINUTE READ)
[https://analyticsindiamag.com/openai-launches-residency-program-with-210000-annual-salary/?utm_source=tldrai]

OpenAI's Residency is an initiative to empower exceptional researchers
and engineers from diverse fields to transition into the world of AI
and machine learning. It is especially beneficial for researchers
specializing in fields outside of deep learning and welcomes software
engineers seeking to pivot into AI research roles. Residents will
tackle real AI challenges while receiving a full salary.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

HOW TO ERASE HARRY POTTER FROM LLAMA 2 (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02238?utm_source=tldrai]

LLMs have been trained on massive amounts of data, much of which is
copyright protected. Removing or unlearning such data is a challenge.
This work uses a proxy model as a teacher to simulate a clean model
and further fine-tunes the base model, which reduces knowledge of
undesirable information while maintaining benchmark performance. 

BOOSTING VISION TRANSFORMERS FOR FLEXIBLE IMAGE RESOLUTIONS (11 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04134v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Researchers present a solution, called Multi-Head Self-Attention
Convolution (MSA-Conv), which allows Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
handle images of different sizes without needing changes in their
design or the need to resize images. 

SETTING NEW STANDARDS IN BLIND SUPER-RESOLUTION (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04180v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This study introduces a novel Transformer model that is tailored to
blind super-resolution, a task that deals with images with unknown
noise. The method outshines current approaches through its blend of
traditional CNNs and a new Transformer design attuned to degradation
patterns.

😘 KISS BUGS GOODBYE WITH FULLY AUTOMATED END-TO-END TEST COVERAGE
(SPONSOR)
[https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugGoodbye10102023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter]

If you've tried to build automated test coverage in-house, you know it
takes years to scale. Try QA Wolf
[https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugGoodbye10102023&utm_source=tldrai&utm_medium=newsletter]
instead - they get web apps to 80% test coverage in just 4 months.
They will create and maintain your test suite in open-source
Playwright (no vendor lock-in, you own the code), and provide
unlimited parallel test runs on their infrastructure.
The best part: QA Wolf saves you money. QA Wolf has multiple case
studies of customers saving at least $200k/year in QA engineering and
infrastructure costs. Schedule a demo

SIMPLEX RANDOM FEATURE ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/notarussianteenager/srf-attention?utm_source=tldrai]

Attention is useful but computationally expensive. However, once
trained, with a bit of fine-tuning compute you can drop in SRF
attention and remove the dependence on sequence length, speeding
things up considerably. 

LEPTONAI (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/leptonai/leptonai?utm_source=tldrai]

A Pythonic framework to simplify AI service building. 

MAKING CNNS SHINE IN FEDERATED LEARNING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ucsc-vlaa/fedconv?utm_source=tldrai]

This study delves into how different architectural elements in machine
learning models affect their performance in federated learning,
especially when handling varied data sources. Through in-depth
analysis, researchers found that with certain tweaks, Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) can perform as well or even better than Vision
Transformers in such settings.

HOW AMD MIGHT GET ACROSS THE CUDA MOAT (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/10/05/how-amd-may-get-across-the-cuda-moat/?utm_source=tldrai]

There is a heavy shortage of GPUs for the current AI demand. Many
services have long queue times or are restricting access as a result.
If other chip makers can overcome some of their software deficiencies,
maybe via recent Pytorch improvements, they may be able to compete for
some of this demand. 

AI ISN’T A DRILL, AND YOUR USERS DON’T WANT HOLES (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/10/ai-isnt-a-drill-and-your-users-dont-want-holes/?utm_source=tldrai]

AI is often misunderstood as a one-size-fits-all solution, but
businesses need to recognize that it's merely a tool, and not every
business requires it. Identifying genuine problems and needs should
precede technology adoption, rather than trying to retrofit AI
solutions where they may not be needed or beneficial. 

HOW TO LOSE AT GENERATIVE AI (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://platforms.substack.com/p/how-to-lose-at-generative-ai?utm_source=tldrai]

Great read on the tricky parts of creating value around generative AI
for startups. While the incumbents are favored, finding your path and
creating real value early is where startups can have a fighting
chance.
