HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 META POACHES THINKING MACHINES LAB CO-FOUNDER ANDREW TULLOCH (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 He had previously turned down an offer from Meta for $1.5 billion
over six years, and Thinking Machines CEO Mira Murati had declined an
acquisition offer for an undisclosed amount. 

 FIRST REAL SAMPLES OF VEO 3.1 GENERATED VIDEOS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Veo 3.1 marks a noticeable step forward in prompt fidelity and
visual/audio quality. It doesn't have the same issues as Veo 3, like
occasional oddities with object proportions. The model demonstrates a
better understanding of nuance, creating videos that closely match
prompt intent. Traces of the model have appeared in Vertex AI and
Google Vids. An official release is likely in the coming weeks. 

 MUSK'S XAI JOINS RACE TO BUILD ‘WORLD MODELS' TO POWER VIDEO GAMES
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI has joined Meta and Google in the race to develop AI systems that
can navigate and design physical environments. The company is building
world models with the goal of applying them in gaming. These models
could be used to generate interactive 3D environments and unlock uses
for AI beyond software and computers in physical products. Elon Musk
announced on X that xAI would release a 'great' AI-generated game
before the end of next year.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 IS AI A BUBBLE? (22 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Not yet, but it's close. GenAI is a demand-led, capital-intensive
boom with revenues doubling annually and expected to hit $100 billion
by 2026. Capital expenditure to revenue ratios (six times) are high,
exceeding both railroads (two times) and telecom (four times) at their
peaks, but there are other indicators: economic strain above 2% of
GDP, industry strain with capex over 10x revenue, revenue growth
slowing below 50% annually, price-to-earnings ratios hitting 50-60, or
internal cash covering under 25% of capex. Until two of these are met,
the current risk, while large, is manageable. 

 WHY ARE EMBEDDINGS SO CHEAP? (32 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Embeddings are a fundamental component of every modern retrieval
augmented generation system. This post shows what computations are
required to produce an embedding and how this can be used to calculate
the true dollar cost of processing a token. The cost of processing a
token is minuscule, and all embedding models converge to similar
semantic representations, so no provider really enjoys a sustainable
moat. This results in prices racing to the bottom as the underlying
low costs are being passed directly on to consumers.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 OPENROUTER: 500+ AI MODELS IN ONE API + SDK (SPONSOR) [10] 

 OpenRouter gives you a single set of endpoints to run ALL the major
models [10]: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and more. Swap
models at request level, route across providers by price or latency,
and have fallback options to survive outages. Get started in 30
seconds [10] 

 CLAUDE CODE PLUGINS NOW IN PUBLIC BETA (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic has introduced plugin support in Claude Code, allowing
users to install custom slash commands, agents, MCP servers, and hooks
with a single command. These modular extensions simplify setup sharing
and enable flexible customizations for development workflows. 

 INFERENCEMAX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 InferenceMAX continually re-benchmarks the world's most popular
open-source inference frameworks and models to track real performance
in real time. It captures progress in near real-time. A live dashboard
is available for free. 

 REASONINGBANK: SCALING AGENT SELF-EVOLVING WITH REASONING MEMORY (1
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ReasoningBank is a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. Agents can store and retrieve memories from ReasoningBank
to inform their decisions. They can integrate new learnings and become
more capable over time. The better memory enables more effective
scaling. ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory
mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful task
routines across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks. 

 META'S AGENT LEARNING (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta has introduced "early experience," a training approach using
data from an agent's own interactions without external rewards. It
improves policy learning via implicit world modeling and
self-reflection.

 WHY AMERICA BUILDS AI GIRLFRIENDS AND CHINA BUILDS AI BOYFRIENDS (15
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A market scan of 110 AI companion platforms reveals stark
differences: 52% are US-based, targeting young men with
hypersexualized anime AI girlfriends monetized through NSFW premium
features. Chinese platforms target adult women aged 25-40 with dynamic
AI boyfriends featuring card-collecting mechanics and WeChat
integrations, shaped by China's marriage crisis (20% drop in 2024) and
gender imbalance. 

 THE CHATGPT APP STORE MOMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI just launched apps inside ChatGPT where you can say "Spotify,
make me a playlist" or "DoorDash, order my usual" and it handles
everything conversationally. This looks like early iPhone web apps,
not true native experiences yet, but the trajectory is clear. As
OpenAI expands its SDK to give developers access to user memory,
persistent state, and action execution, we'll see actual native
ChatGPT applications designed for conversational interfaces.
