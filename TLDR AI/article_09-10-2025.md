 AI ADOPTION IS HIGH, TRUST IS LOW, AND 99% OF EPD TEAMS ARE
FRUSTRATED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 According to Notion's recent survey of 1,350 engineering, product,
and design leaders [4], teams aren't just asking for shinier AI. They
want better documentation and knowledge sharing.

Here's why:

👉 44% of EPD teams use more than six tools daily

👉 99% say parts of product development are manual, repetitive, or
time-consuming

👉 35% of Directors/VPs say teams aren't fully aligned

👉 AI adoption is at 91%, but ICs are much less satisfied than their
managers

Read the full analysis [4]to see the how product teams are closing the
alignment gap and accelerating innovation. Unlock the report [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 SORA'S IOS DOWNLOADS IN ITS FIRST WEEK WAS NEARLY AS BIG AS CHATGPT'S
LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Despite being invite-only, the Sora app had 627,000 downloads
compared to ChatGPT's 606,000 in its first week. It also reached No. 1
on the US App Store by its third day. 

 AN INTERVIEW WITH OPENAI CEO SAM ALTMAN ABOUT DEVDAY AND THE AI
BUILDOUT (33 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sam Altman expects that OpenAI's revenue will eventually pay for its
trillion-dollar infrastructure effort - but to lock in hardware
agreements, he's willing to finance investments ahead of revenue. He
portrays this as a better-than-average interest rate loan for key
partners. OpenAI's success thus far comes down to two main surprises:
ChatGPT far exceeded expectations at launch, and big tech companies
have fumbled catching up since then. 

 OPENAI'S NICK TURLEY ON TRANSFORMING CHATGPT INTO AN OPERATING SYSTEM
(13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Third parties can now reach ChatGPT's 800 million users during their
everyday conversations. Apps are now part of the core ChatGPT
experience. Developers can build interactive experiences in ChatGPT
beyond just chatbots connected to their company's data. This article
contains an interview with OpenAI's Nick Turley on how ChatGPT will
distribute AGI to the masses.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 STATE OF LLMS IN LATE 2025 (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI landscape has evolved into a hyper-specialized ecosystem where
each model has distinct strengths. The challenges emerging include
diminishing returns on scaling, massive energy consumption, and the
rise of smaller specialized models. This guide explains the technical
foundations that make each model different so developers can choose
the right tool for their task. Success now means understanding each
model's strengths, testing on specific use cases, routing
intelligently, and staying current. 

 HARVARD ECONOMIST: AI DATA CENTER BOOM POWERS 92% OF US GDP GROWTH,
MASKING ECONOMIC STAGNATION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The massive spending on AI data centers is almost single-handedly
propping up the US economy. It drove 92% of GDP growth in the first
half of this year. The economy could have flatlined with just 0.1%
growth without the investment. The surge stems from an escalating AI
compute arms race. The spending raises concerns about an unsustainable
bubble masking weakness elsewhere.

 AI-GENERATED TESTS ARE LYING TO YOU (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Developers have shifted to getting AI to generate unit tests over the
last year. While this makes everything look good, often, developers
are actually just replacing validation with transcription. The more
developers automate testing without understanding it, the more they
risk turning existing bugs into features. The future of software
engineering belongs to those who automate the right things and keep
thinking about the rest. AI can amplify good engineering discipline,
but it can't replace it. 

 LESS IS MORE: RECURSIVE REASONING WITH TINY NETWORKS (14 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 A single Samsung researcher developed Tiny Recursive Model, which
uses a 2-layer network that recursively improves its answer up to 16
times. It outperforms DeepSeek R1 and o3-mini-high on ARC-AGI by 10%
to 30% despite having 0.01% of the parameters. The approach simplifies
the Hierarchical Reasoning Model by eliminating complex mathematical
theorems and dual-network hierarchies, and suggests that smaller
networks with deeper recursion generalize better than larger ones
without recursion. 

 MEET LLMC: BEATING ALL COMPRESSION WITH LLMS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 LLMc uses AI models to compress natural language. It serves as a
high-capacity probabilistic reference system, enabling compression
based on token prediction and rank encoding. It efficiently identifies
high-likelihood token sequences and encodes them into a compact form
using LLMs' in-context capabilities. Benchmarks show that LLMc
outperforms traditional compressors such as ZIP and LZMA across a
range of datasets.

 5 THINGS NVIDIA'S JENSEN HUANG SAID ABOUT THE STATE OF THE AI RACE
WITH CHINA (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stressed the US is "not far ahead" of China
in AI and urged a nuanced strategy to stay competitive. China's rapid
energy production and AI adoption, coupled with local tech giants like
Huawei advancing chip systems, pose significant competition. Huang
warned of isolating American tech, advocating for global diffusion to
maintain leadership in the AI race. 

 WHY CALIFORNIA'S NEW AI SAFETY LAW SUCCEEDED WHERE SB 1047 FAILED (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 California's new AI safety law, SB 53, requires major AI labs to
disclose their safety protocols, ensuring greater transparency. The
law's success where SB 1047 failed is due to its focus on
"transparency without liability" and includes whistleblower
protections and safety incident reporting. This move could set a
precedent for other states to adopt similar regulations.
