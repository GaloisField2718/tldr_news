 REPORT: NEW DATA ON NAVIGATING THE AI ADOPTION GAP (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Around 2 out of 3 executives say generative AI adoption has created
tension — 42% say it's tearing their company apart. For many
enterprises, conflicts, silos, and even sabotage are stalling
progress. Yet there's reason for optimism: 77% of employees using AI
are, or could become, an AI champion.

The Writer 2025 generative AI [4] report explores the pain points and
potential of AI in the enterprise. In partnership with Workplace
Intelligence, we uncovered what leaders are struggling with, where
there's opportunity, and what employees think about AI adoption
efforts.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 AMAZON NOVA ACT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amazon has introduced Nova Act, an AI model that allows agents to
perform tasks within web browsers. A research preview SDK is
available. The SDK helps developers create agents to execute complex,
multi-step tasks by breaking them down into atomic commands and
enabling browser manipulation for improved reliability. Nova Act aims
to expand agent capabilities beyond simple tasks covered by APIs,
enhancing business productivity and task automation. 

 RUNWAY'S NEW VIDEO MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Runway has released its next-generation video model, which excels at
prompt adherence and cinematic motion generation. 

 OPENAI TO RELEASE AN OPEN WEIGHT MODEL (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI is soliciting feedback for an open weight model that has
reasoning. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VIDEO GENERATION FAITHFULNESS BENCHMARK (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A benchmark to determine how faithful video generation is to the
prompt given. It also proposes methods to encourage model generation
quality with respect to the user's input prompt. 

 UNLEARNING SENSITIVE CONTENT FROM LLMS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper proposes a model merging technique to selectively forget
sensitive content in LLMs while preserving general knowledge. 

 OPTIMAL STEPSIZE IN DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Optimal Stepsize for Diffusion Sampling (OSS) optimizes sampling in
diffusion models by learning efficient stepsize schedules through
dynamic programming. It achieves 10x speedup while preserving nearly
full generation quality.

 FAST TEXT-TO-3D (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Using Progressive Rendering Distillation to train 3D generators from
text prompts without ground-truth meshes generates high-quality 3D
meshes in 1.2 seconds and outperforms prior methods. 

 TIDE FOR UNDERWATER SCENE UNDERSTANDING (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A text-to-image and dense annotation generation method for underwater
scenes that enables high-quality synthetic datasets with consistent
pixel-level labels. 

 EARTH AI'S ALGORITHMS FOUND CRITICAL MINERALS IN PLACES EVERYONE ELSE
IGNORED (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Earth AI has discovered promising mineral deposits in previously
overlooked regions of Australia using AI-driven analysis. Unlike
traditional methods, Earth AI's technology scans large areas rapidly
to identify potential sites for minerals like copper and cobalt. This
innovative approach highlights a shift in mining towards leveraging AI
for more efficient exploration.
