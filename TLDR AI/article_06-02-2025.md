 OPENAI'S TRADEMARK HINTS AT ROBOTICS AND AI HARDWARE (6 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 OpenAI's recent trademark application suggests potential AI-powered
consumer hardware, including smartwatches, AR glasses, humanoid
robots, and custom AI chips, aligning with ongoing partnerships and
research into AI-driven robotics. 

 SOFTBANK-BACKED BILLIONAIRE TO INVEST $230M IN INDIAN AI STARTUP
KRUTRIM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Bhavish Aggarwal is investing $230 million in his AI startup Krutrim
to develop LLMs for Indian languages, aiming to raise $1.15 billion in
total. Krutrim has open-sourced its AI models and plans to build
India's largest supercomputer with Nvidia. The startup has released
Krutrim-2, a 12-billion-parameter model, showing strong performance in
Indian language tasks and code generation. 

 DEEPSEEK GETS AN 'F' IN SAFETY FROM RESEARCHERS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cisco tested DeepSeek's open-source model, DeepSeek R1, which failed
to fend off all 50 harmful behavior prompts from the HarmBench
dataset. DeepSeek's failure rate is the highest among tested LLMs,
with other models like Meta's Llama 3.1 and OpenAI's o1 performing
noticeably better. The model's susceptibility to attacks, alongside
data security concerns, has raised significant scrutiny and criticism.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 VISION SEARCH ASSISTANT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vision Search Assistant is a framework that combines Vision Language
Models (VLMs) with web agents to improve object recognition, even for
unfamiliar images. 

 MONST3R: A SIMPLE APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING GEOMETRY IN THE PRESENCE OF
MOTION (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A great project that can take video as input and estimate geometry
and camera motions without any knowledge of camera intrinsics. 

 TOWARDS SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY WITH DICTIONARY LEARNING: EXTRACTING
BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS FROM MICROSCOPY FOUNDATION MODELS (20 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Dictionary learning reveals model interpretability and can discover
unknown concepts from scientific data, like cell images. It
successfully extracts concepts like cell type and genetic
perturbation. A new algorithm, ICFL, combined with PCA whitening,
enhances feature selectivity over existing methods.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 USE THE LATEST AI MODELS ON GITHUB COPILOT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Different models excel at different tasks, and GitHub Copilot [10]
gives you the freedom to choose. Switch between Gemini 2.0 Flash,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and more to solve the most complicated
coding dilemmas. Edit files simultaneously, generate tests, get code
reviews, and watch your productivity soar. Start for free on GitHub or
VS Code. [10] 

 GETTING STARTED WITH REAL ROBOTS (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Great post from Hugging Face about using its LeRobot framework to
control a robotic arm for research and development. 

 AUTOMATING SOP CREATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Manually creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is
time-consuming, but video-language models offer a promising solution
by analyzing demonstration videos. 

 MEDICAL MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This paper introduces Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), a
framework designed to enhance the performance of medical foundation
models by dividing them into lightweight expert models focused on
specific anatomical regions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HOW INDIGENOUS ENGINEERS ARE USING AI TO PRESERVE THEIR CULTURE (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Indigenous researchers are using AI and machine learning to build
speech recognition models for over 200 endangered Indigenous languages
in North America. Initiatives like First Languages AI Reality train
Native scientists to ethically handle culturally sensitive data and
preserve language. Programs such as Tech Natives and IndigiGenius aim
to boost Indigenous representation in tech to preserve cultural
heritage through AI. 

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS OPENAI IS GOING TO DELIVER A BEATDOWN ON DEEPSEEK (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI's Sam Altman responded to Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 model
outperforming competitors at lower costs, which created significant
turbulence in the tech industry, by pledging to continue heavy
investment in compute resources, emphasizing ambition towards AGI. The
situation raises questions about the viability of OpenAI's costly
approach given DeepSeek's efficient alternatives. 

 CHINESE AND IRANIAN HACKERS ARE USING U.S. AI PRODUCTS TO BOLSTER
CYBERATTACKS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Hackers from China, Iran, and other nations are using AI,
specifically Google's Gemini, to enhance cyberattacks, treating it as
a tool for boosting productivity rather than creating groundbreaking
techniques. Google reports found that groups linked to these countries
are leveraging Gemini for research and phishing, with China and Iran
being the most active users. Although AI hasn't yet transformed the
scale of cyberattacks, both the U.S. and China are heavily investing
in AI technologies for future dominance.
