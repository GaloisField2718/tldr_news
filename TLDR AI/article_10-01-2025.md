RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TRANSPARENT VIDEO GENERATION (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The transparent generation algorithm includes the alpha channel which
increases the usefulness of the model for VFX applications. 

 3D BIRD GENERATION (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This algorithm can generate novel birds by using parts and a learned
combination algorithm. The results are stunning and quite useful due
to the quality of the underlying generated mesh. 

 GUI AUTOMATION WITH MULTIMODAL MODELS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 InfiGUIAgent is a GUI automation tool that leverages multimodal large
language models and a two-stage training process to enhance reasoning
and interaction. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 NEURAL SVG GENERATION (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many works are aimed at generating SVG images. This one specifically
generated parts of objects in order such that the resulting image is
clean, editable, and minimal. The output is also quite compelling. 

 DIFFSENSEI: BRIDGING MULTI-MODAL LLMS AND DIFFUSION MODELS FOR
CUSTOMIZED MANGA GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Controllable, consistent, character and dialogue box generation for
manga story creation. It operates almost like a control net for
character consistency. 

 A NEW ADAPTATION METHOD (GITHUB REPO) [12]

 AI & QUANT EXPERIMENTATION IN GROWTH MARKETING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Marketing is rapidly being transformed by AI. This article describes
strategies in growth marketing that are working today, including
agents that power self-improving websites and content personalization
at large scale. These strategies are referred to as “quant
experimentation”, a nod to quant trading, which similarly
revolutionized the world of finance in the 1980s, and share parallels
with the transformation happening in growth marketing. 

 NO, LLMS ARE NOT "SCHEMING" (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In 2024, we comfortably outpaced the Turing test with AI like
OpenAI's o1. AI showcases impressive conversational abilities yet
lacks human-like situational awareness - there are debates over
whether LLMs are mere pattern learners or entities with reasoning
skills. These models excel in replicating but struggle to prioritize
patterns due to a lack of contextual understanding. The focus should
remain on refining model training and evaluation methods instead of
attributing human-like traits or intentions to AI systems. 

 WHAT JUST HAPPENED (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI advancements have accelerated, with several new GPT-4 level and
Gen3 models emerging, offering both revolutionary and incremental
improvements. The o1 models demonstrate advanced reasoning, can catch
errors in academic papers, and are able to assist in research,
highlighting AI's expanding role beyond traditional tasks. AI
capabilities now include real-time video interaction and improved
text-to-video generation, indicating profound future implications and
opportunities for integration across fields.
