HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 DBRX MOE (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Databrix and Mosaic have trained a 132B parameter MoE model with
impressive performance. They trained the model on 3,000 H100s and have
released the weights. The model is also available on the Databricks
API. 

 AMAZON INVESTS ANOTHER $2.75B IN ANTHROPIC (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Amazon finalized a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, its largest
venture investment yet. 

 HERE‚ÄôS WHY AI SEARCH ENGINES REALLY CAN‚ÄôT KILL GOOGLE (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Emerging AI-driven search tools challenge Google by offering direct
and explorative answers, but struggle to match its speed, diverse
functionalities, and efficient data presentation, underscoring the
complexity of replacing traditional search with AI.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 BINARY SEARCH VECTORS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Searching over embedding vectors is a key to RAG pipelines. If you
replace the fp32 numbers with a single 0 or 1, then use a KNN
clusterer and reranker, you can maintain performance while shrinking
memory requirements 30x. 

 DEEPFAKE TECHNOLOGY AND DETECTION METHODS (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This comprehensive survey delves into the advancements and challenges
of deepfake technology and its detection, highlighting the arms race
between deepfake creators and those developing technologies to spot
them. 

 AUDIO-DRIVEN ANIMATION (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AniPortrait is a framework designed to create lifelike animated
portraits from a single reference image and audio input. By
translating audio into 3D representations and then mapping these onto
2D facial landmarks, this method produces animations that excel in
natural facial expressions, varied poses, and high visual quality.

 üÜì SEMANTIC LAYER SUMMIT 2024 (SPONSOR) [12] 

 This year‚Äôs Semantic Layer Summit features an impressive lineup
[12] of industry experts from Netflix, Snowflake, Google, and AtScale.
On the agenda: LLM explainability, semantic layer strategies, and
FinOps for data. Register for the 2024 virtual event (free!) [12] 

 BENCHMARK LLMS BY PLAYING STREET FIGHTER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LLMs are useful in as much as they are fast, accurate, and follow
directions. This combination makes a street fighter emulator with text
input an excellent way to figure out which models are good at these
three criteria. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH TEXT AND POSE CONDITIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AID and its variant PAID are two techniques designed to improve image
interpolation by incorporating conditions like text and poses. These
methods ensure the production of images with enhanced consistency,
smoothness, and fidelity without requiring additional training. 

 BOOSTING EFFICIENCY IN MODELS WITHOUT EXTRA TRAINING (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The OPTIN framework introduces a novel way to enhance the efficiency
of transformer-based AI models across various domains without the need
for re-training. By using a technique called intermediate feature
distillation, OPTIN can compress networks under specific constraints
while barely affecting accuracy.

MISCELLANEOUS

 INSIDE THE SHADOWY GLOBAL BATTLE TO CONTROL AI (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The world is grappling with the challenge of regulating AI. A series
of high-profile meetings and conferences involving global leaders,
tech executives, and policymakers revealed divisions and a lack of
consensus on how to control this transformative technology. 

 BUILD EVALUATION PIPELINES ON YOUR OWN DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 New models are regularly released that claim to be the state of the
art on standard benchmarks. It is important to measure these models on
your own tasks and data. Superpipe is a tool that helps build these
evaluation pipelines on your data. 

 HACKERS CAN READ PRIVATE AI-ASSISTANT CHATS EVEN THOUGH THEY‚ÄôRE
ENCRYPTED (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers discovered a side-channel attack that can decipher
encrypted AI assistant chats with high accuracy on specific topics by
exploiting token transmission within the encryption. The attack
utilizes large language models to reconstruct token sequences into
readable text, potentially exposing sensitive user conversations.
Major AI assistants, except for Google Gemini, are vulnerable to this
method, prompting providers to seek mitigation strategies.
