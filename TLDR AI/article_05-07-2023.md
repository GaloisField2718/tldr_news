WHAT THE EUROPEAN AI ACT MEANS FOR YOU, AI DEVELOPER (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://encord.com/blog/what-the-european-ai-act-means-for-you/?utm_source=tldrai]

The EU AI Act is the world's first legislation on artificial
intelligence, similar to GDPR but for AI. It introduces definitions
for 'foundation models' and 'general-purpose AI systems' and sets out
dos and don'ts for AI practices. The Act also focuses on trustworthy
AI development and includes obligations for high-risk AI systems. The
legislation is currently going through final negotiations before
enforcement. 

WHY TRANSFORMATIVE AI IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO ACHIEVE (21 MINUTE
READ)
[https://zhengdongwang.com/2023/06/27/why-transformative-ai-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve.html?utm_source=tldrai]

While humans have a good track record of innovation, the trend growth
rate of GDP per capita has never exceeded three percent per year.
There has yet to be a technology that breaks the three percent
threshold. Only strong evidence should cause us to expect anything
different. AI is likely transformative in the same way that the
internet was, but it has many hurdles in the way to the accelerating
growth rates predicted by some. 

OPENAI TURNS OFF CHATGPT BROWSING FEATURE (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://decrypt.co/147300/openai-disables-web-browse-bing-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai]

Despite complaints from ChatGPT Plus subscribers who benefited from
the feature, OpenAI has temporarily disabled "Browse with Bing" on its
ChatGPT service, citing concerns that the AI was inadvertently
bypassing paywalls and privacy settings. OpenAI insists this move was
made to respect content ownership rights, with a return of the
browsing feature planned after necessary adjustments.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

MACHINE LEARNING FOR POLYNOMIAL EQUATIONS (37 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00252?utm_source=tldrai]

Solving systems of polynomial equations sometimes results in
singularities which are poorly behaved points. There are certain
resolution strategies which allow for solutions at these points.
Resolution is a challenging process, but if you frame it as a game and
apply RL, you can achieve impressive performance. 

A FASTER, SMARTER WAY TO INPAINT PICTURES (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00407v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Imagine having a tool that can fill in missing parts of a picture
quickly and accurately - that's what the WavePaint model does! It uses
something called a WaveMix-based architecture to mend images, working
faster and needing fewer steps than current methods. 

PREDICTING SUICIDE RISK: A MULTI-TASK LEARNING APPROACH (16 MINUTE
READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00995v1?utm_source=tldrai]

This research introduces a new model to predict suicide risk in people
with bipolar disorder. The model uses symptoms found in these posts to
understand which are most influential in predicting future suicide
risk, helping doctors to better understand these patients and provide
timely help.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

REAL LATENT IMAGE EDITING (HUGGINGFACE SPACE)
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/editing-images/ledits?utm_source=tldrai]

There's been a meme going around amongst AI researchers about turning
them all into Tom Cruise. This space that lets you turn yourself into
Tom Cruise easily by using latent image editing with DDPM models. It
seems to work better on faces than on objects. 

S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/GRVYDEV/S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y?utm_source=tldrai]

S.A.T.U.R.D.A.Y provides tools to build elegant vocal interfaces to
modern LLMs. 

AIDER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider?utm_source=tldrai]

Aider is a command-line chat tool that allows you to write and edit
code with OpenAI's GPT models.

Scott Alexander explores the different scenarios of a post-AI takeoff
world. 

AI, OZYMANDIAS (15 MINUTE READ)
[https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/ai-or-the-eternal-recurrence-of-hubris?utm_source=tldrai]

In the late 19th century, there was a widespread belief that human
knowledge was nearing completion. This was due to rapid progress in
science and technology, particularly in physics and biology. However,
this confidence was misplaced, as new discoveries soon overturned many
of the old assumptions. Freddie DeBoer argues that we are currently
seeing a similar recurrence of hubris in AI. While AI has achieved
impressive results in recent years, it is important to remember that
it is still a very young field with much that we do not understand. We
should be wary of making grandiose claims about AI's potential, as we
may eventually be proven wrong in the same way that the late
Victorians were. 

HYPERDIMENSIONAL COMPUTING REIMAGINES AI (13 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-approach-to-computation-reimagines-artificial-intelligence-20230413/?utm_source=tldrai]

A new approach to computation called hypervectors is being explored as
a way to improve artificial intelligence. Hypervectors are large
vectors that represent concepts. They can be used to reason about the
world in a more abstract and efficient way than traditional methods.
