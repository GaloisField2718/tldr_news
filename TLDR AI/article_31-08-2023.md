RESEARCH & INNOVATION

UNIVERSAL MEDICAL SEGMENTATION (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://universeg.csail.mit.edu/?utm_source=tldrai]

Medical image segmentation is the process of identifying every pixel
in an image that belongs to a certain class (e.g. cancer vs
non-cancer). It is historically quite challenging to transfer one
model to another task. This new work shows a robust model, still based
on the immortal UNet, that works across a variety of medical imaging
tasks. 

COTRACK DENSE VIDEO TRACKING (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/co-tracker?utm_source=tldrai]

There are lots of dense pixel tracking tools out there, but many fail
when faced with occlusions or fast motion. This work from Meta is a
powerful tool that is fast and easy to use. Maybe someone can recreate
videodoodles now? 

A LIGHTWEIGHT UPSAMPLER TO INCREASE IMAGE RESOLUTION (14 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15085v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Traditional methods for increasing image resolution, like CARAFE and
SAPA, often need a lot of computer resources and are limited in their
applications. DySample is a simpler and more efficient way to do this,
and it works well in various image tasks.

CUDA GRAPHS, 2.3X SPEEDED UP ON LLAMA 2 (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.fireworks.ai/speed-python-pick-two-how-cuda-graphs-enable-fast-python-code-for-deep-learning-353bf6241248?utm_source=tldrai]

A great in-depth read about how to improve the performance of deep
learning models using PyTorch 2.0's torch.compile and Nvidia CUDA
graph features. This article is a gold mine for performance-sensitive
AI folks. 

BATTERYML (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/microsoft/BatteryML?utm_source=tldrai]

An open source toolkit for research on battery degradation. It
includes datasets, feature engineering tools, and a library of models.


IMPROVING 3D BODY POSE DETECTION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/nies14/spatio-temporal-mlp-graph?utm_source=tldrai]

Current methods of understanding 3D human body poses focus mainly on
how body parts are related in space, but often ignore how they move
over time. This new method looks at both space and time, making it
better at understanding poses, especially when parts of the body are
hidden or unclear.

NON-LLAMA LANGUAGE MODEL THAT‚ÄôS PRETTY GREAT (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/Writer/InstructPalmyra-20b?utm_source=tldrai]

Finding a model not built on the foundation model from Meta is a
challenge these days. Palmyra from Writer was trained on 800B tokens
and 70k highly curated instructions. It excels at following complex
instructions and seems amenable to fine-tuning.
