 DELVE SHIPMAS DAY 2: AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Welcome to Delve Shipmas. Every day this week, Delve is launching a
new AI feature to make compliance more modern than ever. Yesterday, we
launched Delve's AI Copilot that can help on any compliance task or
question. Today, we're launching... AI VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT

Vendor risk management is _painful_. Dozens of vendors, endless
questionnaires, and unclear risk levels. Delve's AI VRM handles this
automatically by auto-gathering security evidence from each vendor,
creating creating findings, and giving you a clear view of your risk
posture. Leave spreadsheets and legacy platforms in the past and enter
the future of risk with Delve AI.
Join companies like 11x, micro1, Bland, Wisprflow and more.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 YOUR YEAR WITH CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI introduced a personalized year-in-review feature called "Your
Year with ChatGPT," available to eligible users in select regions.
Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, the feature highlights individual usage
trends from the past year. 

 Z.AI LAUNCHES GLM-4.7, NEW SOTA OPEN-SOURCE MODEL FOR CODING (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GLM-4.7 is the latest release in Z.AI's General Language Model line.
The high-end foundation model is aimed at advanced reasoning, coding,
and multimodal workloads. The late update expands context handling and
reasoning depth compared to earlier versions. It introduced upgraded
reasoning pipelines and broader multimodal support. 

 MINIMAX M2.1 IS LIVE IN KILO (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MiniMax M2.1 is ahead of DeepSeek and Kimi on several benchmarks. It
is even catching up to state-of-the-art models in some areas. The
model is super-fast and efficient. It is now available to all Kilo
Code users. 

 INTRODUCING MANUS DESIGN VIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Manus Design View is an extension of the Manus agent for seamless AI
design workflows. It enables designers to generate concepts with
simple prompts, make precise edits using the Mark Tool, and change
text easily. The Manus mobile app allows design edits on-the-go with
either text or voice input. It is available to all users today.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HARDENING ATLAS AGAINST PROMPT INJECTION (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post details OpenAI's ongoing efforts to secure its AI browser,
Atlas, against prompt injection attacks - malicious instructions
embedded in web content that manipulate agent behavior. While
mitigation techniques are improving, the company acknowledged prompt
injection remains an unsolved and persistent threat, particularly as
agent capabilities expand on the open web. 

 ASYNC CODING AGENTS "FROM SCRATCH" (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 It's pretty easy to homebrew your own asynchronous coding agent. This
means that businesses selling coding agents can no longer
differentiate themselves by only running sandboxed agents in the cloud
that connect to Slack. Companies working on coding agents likely
realize this and are doing everything they can to train their own SWE
agents and auxiliary models to improve their harnesses. 

 WHAT (I THINK) MAKES GEMINI 3 FLASH SO GOOD AND FAST (8 MINUTE READ)
[12] 

 Gemini 3 Flash is a lightweight, efficient model optimized for speed
and low latency. It is capable of delivering performance comparable to
Gemini 3 Pro at a fraction of the cost. The model's design brings
unprecedented power but introduces specific tradeoffs in token
efficiency and reliability. This post takes a look at the leaked
architectural details of the new model. 

 WE REMOVED 80% OF OUR AGENT'S TOOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Vercel spent months building a sophisticated internal text-to-SQL
agent with specialized tools, heavy prompt engineering, and careful
context management. It kind of worked, but it was fragile, slow, and
required constant maintenance. The team then deleted most of it and
stripped the agent down to a single tool that executed arbitrary bash
commands. Its agent got simpler and better at the same time: it had a
100% success rate instead of 80%.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 LLM CODE QUALITY LEADERBOARD: HOW DOES YOUR PREFERRED MODEL SCORE?
(SPONSOR) [14] 

 Interested to learn how different LLMs perform for coding? New
research [15] on models like GPT-5.2 High and Gemini 3.0 Pro reveals
trade-offs in structural quality and security.

Learn more about the reliability, security, and maintainability of
code written by the latest models with Sonar's LLM Leaderboard
[14]—the definitive resource to understand the true quality of
AI-generated code.

 AGENT SKILLS FOR CONTEXT ENGINEERING (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Agent Skills
for building production-grade AI agent systems. They are categorized
into Foundational skills, Architectural skills, and Operational
skills. Each skill is structured for efficient context use. The
patterns work on any agent platform that supports skills or allows
custom instructions. 

 OPENTINKER (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 OpenTinker is an RL-as-a-Service infrastructure for foundation
models. It features separation of programming and execution,
separation of environment and training code, and seamless transition
from training to inference. The platform enables users to perform RL
training and inference without requiring local GPU resources by
separating client-side programming from server-side execution. It
provides a high-level Python API that abstracts away the complexity of
distributed systems. 

 SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE BENCHMARK (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 SGI-Bench is a benchmark for assessing Scientific General
Intelligence across the entire research cycle, such as Deliberation,
Conception, Action, and Perception. It spans 10 disciplines with over
1,000 expert-curated tasks inspired by major open scientific
questions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CURSOR EXPANDS AGENT HOOKS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Cursor has announced partnerships to integrate its agent hook system
with security and platform vendors. These hooks allow organizations to
observe, modify, or block stages of the agent loop, supporting use
cases like governance, dependency scanning, secrets management, and
agent safety. 

 THE SHAPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (33 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI's utility in the coming decade will come from understanding the
technology's strengths and where it can be used to augment human
ability. It won't replace humans, at least in the short term, because
we are too complex. However, the technology will eventually conquer
territories we thought were exclusively ours. This will be the first
time we will face true otherness, a new species of being.
