 AGENTS THAT DON'T SUCK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI agents never reach production. Agent Bricks by Databricks [4]
fixes that by helping you build agents that actually work —
accurate, reliable and grounded in your data.

This product delivers practical quality, not hype: automatic
evaluation, metrics tuned to your goals, and human feedback to keep
improving accuracy. Generic benchmarks don't cut it. Agent Bricks
measures performance on the tasks that matter to your business.

The result: production agents you can trust [4] — built fast,
governed from day one and ready for real workloads.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 A BUSINESS THAT SCALES WITH THE VALUE OF INTELLIGENCE (7 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 OpenAI believes that its business model should scale with the value
intelligence delivers. It introduced consumer subscriptions as people
demanded more capability and reliability, created workplace
subscriptions, and added usage-based pricing so costs scale with real
work getting done. It has more recently applied the principle to
commerce, helping people choose what to purchase next and explore
products. Advertising follows the same arc. 

 ADS IN CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI plans to introduce ads in the free and ChatGPT Go tiers to
support broader access to AI. Ads will be tested first in the US,
while ensuring user trust, data privacy, and ad quality. 

 ELON MUSK'S XAI BRINGS 1GW COLOSSUS 2 AI TRAINING CLUSTER ONLINE (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 xAI's Colossus 2 supercomputer is now online. It is the first
gigawatt-scale AI training cluster in the world, with upgrades still
to come. xAI has been building infrastructure at a speed that far
exceeds its primary rivals. The company's Colossus 1 and 2 systems now
represent more than one million H100 GPU equivalents.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 BUGBOT'S CODE REVIEW EVOLUTION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cursor's Bugbot has evolved into a capable AI code reviewer that
detects logic, performance, and security issues in pull requests. 

 THE BITTER LESSON OF AGENT FRAMEWORKS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An agent is just a for-loop of messages. Agent frameworks aren't
required. Models only need a complete action space, a for-loop, an
explicit exit, and context management. Every abstraction is a
liability, and every 'helper' is a failure point. The less you build,
the more it works. 

 ON THE COMING INDUSTRIALISATION OF EXPLOIT GENERATION WITH LLMS (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Agents built on GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 autonomously generated over 40
distinct working exploits for a zero-day QuickJS vulnerability across
multiple scenarios, solving complex exploitation tasks in under an
hour and with modest token costs. The experiment suggests exploit
development will soon be limited more by token throughput than human
hacker expertise, meaning offensive cybersecurity tasks could scale
like industrial processes. This shift implies both unprecedented
threat automation and urgency for preparing defense strategies as LLMs
move beyond code assistance into full exploit synthesis.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 TLDR IS HIRING A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER, APPLIED AI ($200K-$300K,
FULLY REMOTE) [11] 

 We're hiring the first engineer on TLDR's new Applied AI team. You'll
build production AI agents and design modular, composable Claude
Skills to let non-technical teammates create their own AI workflows.

 BENCHMARKING AI AGENT MEMORY: IS A FILESYSTEM ALL YOU NEED? (6 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 An agent's memory depends on its architecture, tools, and the
underlying model. You can always mix and match frameworks, tools, and
models. Simple file system tools are sufficient for a well-designed
agent. More complex memory tools can be plugged in via MCP or custom
tools. 

 UNIQUENESS-AWARE RL FOR LLM DIVERSITY (14 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MIT researchers have proposed a new reinforcement learning method
that rewards diverse high-level solution strategies using LLM-based
clustering of rollouts. This method improves pass@k across tasks
without degrading pass@1. 

 SCALING TRILLION-PARAMETER MODELS WITH PP (29 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 SGLang's Chunked Pipeline Parallelism enables efficient ultra-long
context inference at scale. By combining dynamic chunking with
asynchronous communication, its PP4 TP8 setup achieved higher
throughput on large clusters. 

 CHUNKHOUND (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 chunkhound is a Rust-based AI chunking library that splits long
documents into semantically meaningful chunks for embeddings and
retrieval-augmented workflows.

 THE A IN AGI STANDS FOR ADS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI is not dying or running out of money. While it has created a
crazy circular economy, it's unlikely that it is looking to be
acquired. Ads are the key to unlocking profitability. This article
attempts to model OpenAI's expected annual revenue per user by
understanding what it is actually building and how it compares to
existing ad platforms. 

 THE CODE-ONLY AGENT (17 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Building an agent can be overwhelming. The ecosystem pushes
developers toward complexity and the 'right' way to do things. This
post explores a prompting pattern where agents create and run code as
a response to every prompt. In this framework, agents can't do
anything productive without writing code. This method produces a code
witness of an answer, codifying the work in a very literal sense. It
forces agents to produce proofs, run proofs, and interpret proof
results.

QUICK LINKS

 ULTRATHINK IS DEAD. LONG LIVE EXTENDED THINKING (10 MINUTE READ) [19]


 ultrathink, the magic keyword that unlocked Claude's maximum
reasoning power, has been deprecated and replaced with a hidden trick
to get twice the thinking budget on 64X output models. 

 INTRODUCING CHATGPT GO, NOW AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 ChatGPT Go, launched initially in India in 2025, is now available
globally as the most affordable AI subscription at $8/month in the US.


 $1 TRILLION UNLOCK FOR CONSUMER AI (6 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 AI agents that act became mainstream in 2025, but most users still
can't provide the context needed to extract full value, creating a
ceiling for reactive AI.
