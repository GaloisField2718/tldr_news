HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INFLECTION CO-FOUNDERS LEAVE FOR MICROSOFT AI (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Mustafa Suleyman and Kar√©n Simonyan are leaving Inflection to start
Microsoft AI. Sean White is joining as the new CEO. A few senior team
members from Inflection are also joining Microsoft AI. 

 LILAC ACQUIRED BY DATABRICKS (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lilac joins Databricks to continue building their system for
unsupervised language dataset construction. 

 IBM AND NASA BUILD LANGUAGE MODELS TO MAKE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE MORE
ACCESSIBLE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A collaboration between IBM and NASA has resulted in the development
of advanced transformer-based language models trained on scientific
literature for improved performance in natural language understanding
tasks within the scientific domain. These models are open-sourced on
Hugging Face.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DEEPDIVE: HOW SORA WORKS UNDER THE HOOD (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An article from a former OpenAI scientist about Sora and the
potential costs of generating videos. 

 RAG 2.0 (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a way to inject knowledge
into a potentially stale language model. Unfortunately, the current
paradigm of ‚Äúfrozen RAG‚Äù, where only part of the pipeline is
trained and the actual model itself isn‚Äôt updated, performs poorly
outside of demos. This blog outlines the next generation of RAG where
everything is tuned specifically for the task. An open model like
Mistral 7B can outperform traditional GPT-4 RAG in this system. 

 SD3-TURBO (27 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Stable Diffusion 3 is a powerful image generation model. This paper
introduces Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation, which reduces
the number of diffusion steps down to 4 while maintaining image
generation quality.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 BUILD WITH THE FASTEST MIXTRAL-8X7B ON OCTOAI (SPONSOR) [10] 

 OctoAI [10] is the GenAI inference API that makes the most popular
models faster, cheaper, and more reliable at scale. You can switch to
OctoAI [10] in three lines of code and future-proof your app to
leverage the newest LLMs that keep improving.

 CODE FOR QUIET-STAR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Quiet-Star is a reasoning framework that improves language models'
abilities to generate correct output. Its code has been released along
with an 8 step per token model. 

 COMPRESSING TRAINING DATA INTO SMALLER SETS (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Poster Dataset Distillation is a new method that condenses entire
datasets into a single 'poster', enabling AI models to learn from
fewer than one image per class. 

 CONTINUAL LEARNING WITH MOE ADAPTERS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Researchers have developed a new framework to help vision-language
models learn continuously without forgetting previous knowledge using
a system that expands the model with special adapters for new tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 A NEW AGENT FOR INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MineDreamer is an AI agent that excels at following complex
instructions in the Minecraft world thanks to its innovative use of
advanced language and vision models. 

 "AI, NO ADS PLEASE": 4 WORDS TO WIPE OUT $1TN (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI advancement poses a significant threat to the adtech industry,
with its ability to filter out ads, potentially reducing the $1
trillion in annual revenue that companies like Google, Meta, and
TikTok currently enjoy. This series explores how AI disrupts the
crucial ad inventory by appealing to consumers' desire for ad-free
content and questions the stability of Big Tech's business models. The
analysis delves into AI's effects on ad consumption, which has
implications for major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Apple, Meta,
and Alphabet. 

 OPENAI‚ÄôS ‚ÄúOWN GOAL‚Äù (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Elon Musk's lawsuit highlighted OpenAI's departure from its original
open-source ethos to a more closed, profit-driven model that
contradicts its founding principles. An email between OpenAI cofounder
Ilya Sutskever and Musk from 2015 suggests that OpenAI knew early on
that it would deviate from its stated mission. Criticism mounts as
OpenAI faces accusations of failing to correct public misperceptions,
enabling potentially harmful AI outputs and veering away from its
nonprofit origins.
