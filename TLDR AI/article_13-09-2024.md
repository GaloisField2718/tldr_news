HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S NEWEST MODEL (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has released its next model, which was trained to think before
it answers. The new model was trained with reasoning traces and spends
time considering before it answers. In some domains, this has led to
super human performance. The model will be rate limited to 30 or so
queries per user per week, but OpenAI hopes to lift that restriction
soon. 

 GOOGLE IS NOW ROLLING OUT GEMINI LIVE TO FREE USERS ON ANDROID (2
MINUTE READ) [6]

free Android users after a month of advanced user access. Users can
interrupt responses with new information and receive text transcripts
of their interactions. Although Gemini Live doesn't support extensions
like Gmail yet, it offers ten new voice options, and more features are
promised soon.

 1-CLICK FINE-TUNING OF LLAMA 405B (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Axolotal AI has partnered with Lambda Labs to show how to use its one
click cluster to fine-tune the Llama 3.1 405B model. This requires 64
GPUs, but can be done with minimal infra setup due to new tools. 

 CAN LLMS REPRODUCE RESEARCH RESULTS AUTONOMOUSLY? (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 SUPER is a new benchmark designed to assess how well LLMs can
reproduce tasks from research repositories. 

 WILL THE "AI SCIENTIST" BRING ANYTHING TO SCIENCE? (9 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Researchers have developed an AI tool that automates scientific
processes, performing tasks from hypothesis generation to experiment
execution and paper writing. Its accuracy and coherence still need
improvement. Critics highlight that, while AI can handle simulations
in fields like quantum computing and materials science, it risks
narrowing research questions and producing less meaningful knowledge.
Proponents believe this AI could optimize early research stages,
potentially aiding scientists in conceptualizing and scoping research
projects.
