 SENTRY'S AI DEBUGGER USES YOUR ACTUAL ERROR DATA – NOT JUST CODE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most AI coding tools only see your source code. Seer, Sentry's AI
debugging agent [4], sees everything Sentry knows: stack traces, logs,
breadcrumbs, spans, commit history, and the full error context. That's
why it can pinpoint root causes with 95% accuracy [4] – even in
parts of your codebase you've never touched.

HOW IT WORKS:

 	* Sentry logs an issue.
 	* Seer analyzes it using all available context.
 	* Seer suggests a fix, opens a PR automatically, or writes unit
tests to prevent regressions.

Seer also scans issues and assigns actionability scores, so teams know
which bugs are most likely to be fixable with a code change.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 APPLE'S NEW GOOGLE GEMINI DEAL SOUNDS BIGGER, BETTER THAN EXPECTED (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple and Google are teaming up to power Siri with custom AI models.
Google's Gemini models will also be used for more Apple Intelligence
features. Apple's current privacy standards will be upheld as part of
the deal. No Apple user data will be accessible to Google. 

 META LAUNCHES AI INFRASTRUCTURE PUSH WITH META COMPUTE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Meta Compute is an initiative to scale Meta's AI infrastructure. It
includes plans to build tens of gigawatts of energy capacity over the
next decade. CEO Mark Zuckerberg positions infrastructure as a
strategic edge. Key leaders have been appointed to drive technical
architecture, long-term capacity strategy, and government
partnerships. 

 ANTHROPIC INTRODUCED COWORK (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Claude Cowork is a simpler version of Claude Code built into the
Claude Desktop app. Users can assign a folder for Claude to access and
guide it via chat, enabling agent-like workflows without complex
setup. The tool is in research preview and currently limited to Max
subscribers.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 DIGITAL RED QUEEN: ADVERSARIAL PROGRAM EVOLUTION IN CORE WAR WITH
LLMS (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Core War is a competitive programming game in which battle programs
fight for dominance inside a virtual computer. This study explores
what happens when large language models drive an adversarial
evolutionary arms race where programs continuously adapt to defeat a
growing history of opponents rather than a static benchmark. The
dynamic adversarial process led to the emergence of increasingly
general strategies. The Core War sandbox offers a safe and controlled
environment for analyzing how AI agents might evolve in real-world
adversarial settings such as cybersecurity. 

 THE AI DATA CENTER DEALS THAT NO ONE CAN VERIFY (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The AI industry has announced more than half a trillion dollars of
infrastructure commitments over the past year. The headline figures
are being priced as if they represent binding, time-certain capex
commitments, but the disclosed language and missing definitions make
many of them look more like optionality dressed up as commitment. The
refusal to standardize terms, define units, and allow any market-based
verification suggests the participants prefer a world where scrutiny
is expensive. The market is being asked to trust without the tools to
verify. 

 WHEN AI WRITES ALMOST ALL CODE, WHAT HAPPENS TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?
(12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI models like Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 now write most software code,
prompting a shift in software engineering practices. This reduces the
value of language expertise and routine coding tasks while increasing
the demand for tech leads who are product-minded. Although AI can
handle more of the coding workload, engineers will need to oversee
complex tasks, emphasizing a hybrid skill set in both product
management and technical expertise.

 DEEPSEEK FOUNDER LIANG'S FUNDS SURGE 57% AS CHINA QUANTS BOOM (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management posted an average return of
56.6% across its funds in 2025. It was the second-best performer among
Chinese quant funds that manage more than 10 billion yuan. High-Flyer
has become a cash cow for Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek's founder, who still
holds a majority of the asset manager. DeepSeek's research was funded
by High-Flyer's R&D budget. The fund is estimated to have generated
revenues of more than $700 million last year. 

 CLAUDE EXPANDS INTO HEALTHCARE AND LIFE SCIENCES (8 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Anthropic has launched Claude for Healthcare and expanded Claude for
Life Sciences, offering HIPAA-ready tools for medical use and enhanced
support for scientific workflows. 

 100X A BUSINESS WITH AI (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Building effective AI agents requires strong context, memory, and
workflow-aligned architecture. They multiply human output by handling
routine tasks while humans focus on judgment, and should resolve
issues directly rather than just reporting them. Fast deployment and
continuous iteration create compounding value, making custom agents
far more effective than generic AI SaaS.
