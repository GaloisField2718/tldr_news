HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 POEM/1 AI POWERED CLOCK (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A delightful gadget that shows the time via a poem has been launched.
It uses clever prompt caching and is beautifully designed. 

 APPLE CONTINUES WORK ON AI-POWERED SIRI AND MESSAGES FEATURES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple is preparing major artificial intelligence features for iOS 18.
It is using OpenAI's ChatGPT API for internal testing to develop its
own AI models. The first beta of iOS 17.4 revealed a new
SiriSummarization framework that integrates AI into the Messages app
for functionalities like summarization and auto-completion. 

 OPERA TO LAUNCH NEW AI-POWERED BROWSER FOR IOS IN EUROPE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Opera announced the upcoming launch of its AI-powered Opera One
browser for iOS in Europe, following Apple's decision to allow
non-WebKit-based browsers on iOS due to the European Digital Markets
Act.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 100X FASTER CLUSTERING WITH LILAC GARDEN (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A challenge in training language models is finding a diverse enough
dataset for the task. Visualizing this data is even harder. This cool
tool uses fast clustering and topic modeling to enable the exploration
of data to improve filtering and overall quality. 

 REPHRASING THE WEB (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ‚ÄúUp captioning‚Äù is an idea used in many AI systems to improve
labels while training. This work from Apple applies this to
pre-training by rephrasing C4 as Q/A pairs, instructions, and more.
The study found the rephrasing step sped up convergence by 10x, making
the model dramatically more sample efficient - at the cost of the
rephrasing step. 

 CONTINUAL LEARNING: A SURVEY (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper offers a detailed survey of the latest advancements in
continual learning, which focuses on continuously adapting to new data
while retaining previous knowledge.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 REFINING YOUR BACKLOG IS A WASTE OF (YOUR) TIME (SPONSOR) [11] 

 An up-to-date backlog helps your team prioritize the right projects,
but managing it is a ton of work ‚Äî which shouldn‚Äôt fall on you.
Let Height handle the project legwork of backlog refining, bug triage,
and chasing statuses.

 PYTORCH EXPERIMENTAL FLOAT 8 TRAINING (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Training models with lower precision is faster and cheaper, but
unstable. There has been lots of great recent research on quantized
training. This repository builds on those foundations with
easy-to-read and hackable code to enable float8 training. 

 SCENE FLOW ESTIMATION IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 DeFlow is a new method for estimating 3D motion in scenes, a skill
crucial for autonomous driving. It overcomes the limitations of
traditional voxelization by transitioning from voxel-based to point
features using a Gated Recurrent Unit refinement and introducing a
novel loss function. 

 BILLION-SCALE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS WITH GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (GITHUB
REPO) [14] 

 This project introduces MAcro Recommendation Graph (MAG) and Macro
Graph Neural Networks (MacGNN). These approachs tackle the
computational complexity of Graph Neural Networks by grouping similar
behavior patterns into macro nodes, significantly reducing node count.

MISCELLANEOUS

 OPEN SOURCE OLLAMA MOBILE APP (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Enchanted is an open source app for iOS that allows you to run
language models on your mobile device. 

 SLICEGPT: STREAMLINING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS EFFICIENTLY (19 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 SliceGPT introduces a novel post-training sparsification scheme to
reduce the resource demands of large language models. By replacing
weight matrices with smaller ones and reducing embedding dimensions,
it can remove up to 25% of model parameters in major models like
LLAMA2-70B and OPT 66B, while retaining up to 99% task performance. 

 SAM ALTMAN SAYS GPT-5 WILL BE ‚ÄòOKAY‚Äô (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's conflicting messages about AI's potential and
limitations, including alternating between hyping up advancements like
GPT-5 and tempering expectations, reflect a strategic balance between
generating excitement and managing public sentiment but raise
questions about the true progress and impact of AI technology.
