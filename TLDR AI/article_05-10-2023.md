HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

THE MOBILE REVOLUTION VS. THE AI REVOLUTION (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/the-mobile-revolution-vs-the-ai-revolution?utm_source=tldrai]


AI is a technological revolution more akin to the invention of the
internet than the proliferation of smartphones, as computers will no
longer act like calculators, but as something like the human brain. 

MICROSOFT CEO TESTIFIES ABOUT LIMITS OF AI AT GOOGLE ANTITRUST TRIAL
(5 MINUTE READ) [https://archive.ph/PLzds?utm_source=tldrai] 

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified in the U.S. antitrust case
against Google, claiming Google's dominance in internet search is
maintained through unfair tactics, including default agreements with
Apple. Despite investments in AI and new features for Bing, Microsoft
struggles to break Google's market stronghold. Nadella hinted that
even with AI advancements, changing default habits might remain
challenging. 

YAHOO SPINS OUT VESPA, THE ENTERPRISE AI SCALING ENGINE AS AN
INDEPENDENT COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231004777364/en/Yahoo-Spins-Out-Vespa-Its-Enterprise-AI-Scaling-Engine-as-an-Independent-Company?utm_source=tldrai]


Used by companies such as Spotify, Wix, and big financial groups - the
Vespa AI engine is now being spun off. Yahoo is still their largest
customer and financial backer. The engine is performant and can handle
millions of queries per second.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

DEEP DIVE: RUNNING SDXL IN JAX ON TPU V5 (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/blog/sdxl_jax?utm_source=tldrai] 

SDXL is a state of the art image generation model. It is powerful, but
slow. Google and HuggingFace showcase just how fast it can be on the
new TPU chips in Google's research language Jax. 

THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK: ADDING A PAUSE TOKEN TO LLMS IMPROVES
REASONING (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226?utm_source=tldrai] 

The recent work on registers for ViTs showed that adding a [reg] token
fixes image attention map spikes. This work shows that adding a series
of learnable [pause] tokens prepended to the sequence improves
language model reasoning (decoder only, up to 1B) by as much as 18%.
The intuition is that this adds a number of learnable and
manipulatable vectors to store important global information to be used
while generating the sequence. In general, adding tokens has scaled
well past 13B parameters, but it's unclear how well this works at
frontier model scale. 

KNOWLEDGE EDITING IN LLMS (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02129v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

Think of LLMs like big, intricate puzzles with pieces of knowledge.
This paper looks at what happens if we try to change some of those
pieces - it could either mess up the whole puzzle or make it unclear.

MINIGPT-5: A NEW WAY TO GENERATE IMAGES AND TEXT TOGETHER (GITHUB
REPO) [https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/minigpt-5?utm_source=tldrai] 

Imagine a model that not only understands and writes text but can also
create matching pictures. This new model, MiniGPT-5, uses special
techniques called "generative vokens" to do that. 

DO LLMS WORK WELL TOGETHER LIKE HUMANS DO? (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02124v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper studies how LLMs might work together in groups, just like
people in a society. Researchers have made computer "societies" with
different personalities and watched them team up on tasks, finding
they sometimes act like humans - like following the majority or
debating - and some teams work better than others. 

DISTRIBUTED SHAMPOO OPTIMIZER IN PYTORCH (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/optimizers/tree/main/distributed_shampoo?utm_source=tldrai]


AI systems consist of architecture, data, and training methods.
Optimizers fit solidly in the third group. Adam is the current crowd
favorite because it "just works". LION and Shampoo are two
alternatives that have been gaining adoption. Having an implementation
in Pytorch from Meta is a solid stamp of approval.

PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR CLAUDE'S LONG CONTEXT WINDOW (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anthropic.com/index/prompting-long-context?utm_source=tldrai]


Claude's new 100,000 token capacity improves technical document recall
using two techniques. Anthropic has released the "Anthropic Cookbook"
for hands-on experiments with Claude. 

IS AI A PLATFORM SHIFT? (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://matt-rickard.com/is-ai-a-platform-shift?utm_source=tldrai] 

A platform shift alters the foundational layer of application
development, influencing company dominance, architectures, and
business models. Given its potential to change distribution and expand
possibilities, AI is poised to become a significant platform shift,
challenging existing structures and introducing new paradigms.
