HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WINDSURF'S CEO GOES TO GOOGLE; OPENAI'S ACQUISITION FALLS APART (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google DeepMind hired Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas
Chen, and key researchers after OpenAI's $3 billion acquisition
attempt failed. Google gains a nonexclusive license to Windsurf's
technology, enhancing its AI coding capabilities without direct
control. Windsurf faces uncertainty as it loses top talent, continuing
to offer AI coding tools with Jeff Wang as interim CEO. 

 OPENAI DELAYS THE RELEASE OF ITS OPEN MODEL, AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 OpenAI is again delaying the release of its open model. The company
had planned to release the model next week. The release has been
pushed back indefinitely for further safety testing. The release of
OpenAI's open model is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of
the summer. 

 APPLE WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER BUYING MISTRAL (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple is seriously considering acquiring Mistral, a French AI startup
that has raised a total of €1.1 billion over seven funding rounds.
Mistral has launched a range of large and small language models over
the years and achieved notable success with its optical character
recognition features. It is currently Europe's biggest AI startup. The
acquisition of an AI startup would provide a much-needed boost to
Apple's AI ecosystem. 

 MOONSHOT AI'S KIMI K2 OUTPERFORMS GPT-4 IN KEY BENCHMARKS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Chinese startup Moonshot AI released Kimi K2, a 1 trillion parameter
open-source model that matches proprietary models on complex agentic
tasks. The model was trained using a novel MuonClip optimizer that
prevents training crashes that plague model development, potentially
saving millions in computational costs.

 ROBOT CONTROL WITH ASYNC INFERENCE (29 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Asynchronous inference helps robotic policies run more smoothly by
decoupling action prediction from execution, reducing idle time and
improving responsiveness in real-world scenarios. 

 XAI'S GROK 4: THE TENSION OF FRONTIER PERFORMANCE WITH A SIDE OF ELON
FAVORITISM (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 xAI launched Grok 4 on July 9. This post details everything about the
model. It includes a performance overview, a survey of early vibe
checks, tests of Grok 4 Heavy, and comparisons to OpenAI's o3 pro. The
post also discusses xAI's lack of differentiated products,
controversies, and culture risk. While Grok 4 is a very impressive
model, it is plagued with serious behavioral risks and cultural
concerns.

 SCALING UP RL IS ALL THE RAGE RIGHT NOW (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Reinforcement learning (RL) will continue to lead to more gains
because when done well, it is a lot more leveraged, more responsive to
feedback, and superior to supervised fine-tuning. Researchers are
likely to discover more about RL as rollout lengths continue to
expand. There are a lot more S curves to discover, possibly specific
to large language models and without analogues in game/robotics-like
environments. 

 HOW TO SCALE RL TO 10^26 FLOPS (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Reinforcement learning is the next training technique for building
frontier-level AI models. Training it on more data will make it
better. The current approach of scaling is messy and complicated.
Finding a way to do next-token prediction on the web using RL would
enable models to reason from general web data instead of just math and
code. 

 THE UPCOMING GPT-3 MOMENT FOR RL (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 GPT-3 showed that scaling up language models unlocks powerful
performance that often outperforms carefully fine-tuned models. Before
GPT-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance meant first pretraining
models, then fine-tuning them on specific tasks. Today's reinforcement
learning is stuck in a similar pre-GPT paradigm. The approach suffers
from the fundamental limitation where the resulting capabilities
generalize poorly, leading to brittle performance that rapidly
deteriorates outside of the precise contexts seen during training. The
RL field will soon shift toward massive-scale training across
thousands of diverse environments. Doing this effectively will produce
RL models with strong abilities capable of quickly adapting to
entirely new tasks - achieving this will require training environments
at a scale and diversity that dwarfs anything currently available.
