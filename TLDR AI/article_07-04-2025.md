 YOU'VE HEARD THE HYPE. IT'S TIME FOR RESULTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 See what agentic AI can really do on April 10.

After years of siloed experiments, proofs of concept that fail to
scale, and disappointing ROI, most enterprises are stuck. AI isn't
transforming organizations — it's adding complexity, friction, and
frustration. 

But Writer customers are seeing positive impact across their
companies. Our end-to-end platform delivers adoption and ROI at scale.
We're applying that same technology to build agentic AI that actually
works for enterprises. Join us for a live product release on April 10
at 2pm ET (11am PT). [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 LLAMA 4 (6 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Meta has unveiled Llama 4 Scout and Maverick, two 17B parameter
multimodal models that offer state-of-the-art performance on major
benchmarks, along with Llama 4 Behemoth, a 288B model still in
training that surpasses GPT-4.5 in STEM tasks. 

 MIDJOURNEY V7 (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Midjourney has released its new image generation model, V7 alpha. It
brings smarter text interpretation, better image coherence, and
introduces Draft Mode for fast, low-cost iterations with optional
voice commands and personalization. 

 CYBERATTACKS BY AI AGENTS ARE COMING (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI agents are emerging as potent tools in cybersecurity capable of
executing complex attacks and potentially scaling operations like
ransomware. The LLM Agent Honeypot project aims to detect these agents
by simulating vulnerable servers. Its work has revealed that agents
can adapt and avoid detection better than traditional bots. Experts
anticipate an increase in agent-driven cyberattacks, urging preemptive
development of defenses as these technologies evolve. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 UNSUPERVISED PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CUPS is a new method for panoptic segmentation without labeled data
that leverages depth and motion cues to train directly on
scene-centric images. 

 ROPE TO NOPE: HYBRID ATTENTION FOR LONG CONTEXT (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The key innovation that enabled Llama 4 to reach 10m+ tokens in
context is the alternation between no positional embeddings and
rotational positional embeddings. While there are only have benchmarks
on Needle in the Haystack, it seems to be a strong confirmation of
performance of alternating layers. 

 INFERENCE-TIME SCALING FOR GENERALIST REWARD MODELING (31 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This paper from DeepSeek talks about how to use inference time
scaling to make reward modeling better to bootstrap stronger
reasoners. It hints at a broader strategy from the Chinese start-up to
use its existing reasoning models as the base for a new generation of
reward models to train the next generation of reasoners. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 GENERATIVE MODELING FOR CRYSTALS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 CrystalFormer is a transformer model that generates crystal
structures using space group symmetry, making crystal generation more
efficient and data-friendly. 

 NANO AHA MOMENT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A single file, single GPU, from scratch full parameter tuning library
that replicates DeepSeek R1-Zero style training. 

 OBJECT COUNTING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A fully automated zero-shot object counting method leveraging feature
maps and self-attention mechanisms that achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy on the FSC147 dataset. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 DEEPSEEK 1.58BIT GGUF (HUGGING FACE HUB) [14] 

 The unsloth folks have figured out which piece of the new R1 model
can be properly quantized. They also found some tokenizer quirks to be
aware of, which make quantization slightly harder. In summary, just
the MoE layers go to 1.58 bit while everything else remains in 4 or 6
with their dynamic quantization scheme. 

 AI MASTERS MINECRAFT: DEEPMIND PROGRAM FINDS DIAMONDS WITHOUT BEING
TAUGHT (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 DeepMind's AI system, Dreamer, successfully learned to collect
diamonds in Minecraft without prior human guidance, highlighting a
step towards general AI systems. Using reinforcement learning, Dreamer
independently explores and builds a model of the game environment to
predict future actions and outcomes. This advancement suggests
potential applications for AI in real-world scenarios where trial and
error are costly. 

 THE ARTIFACT ISN'T THE ART: RETHINKING CREATIVITY IN THE AGE OF AI (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI-generated Ghibli-style visuals have surged in popularity,
straining OpenAI's servers and sparking debates about creativity in
the AI age. While AI can rapidly produce artistic images, it lacks the
human ability to experience and synthesize complex ideas and emotions.
The future of creativity will focus on meaningful outputs shaped by
human insight and purpose, with AI as a tool rather than a creator.

QUICK LINKS

 GRANITE SPEECH 8B (HUGGING FACE HUB) [17] 

 IBM silently launched a state-of-the-art speech recognition and
understanding model based on its Granite series. 

 START BUILDING WITH GEMINI 2.5 PRO (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro is now in public preview via the Gemini API
on Google AI Studio, with Vertex AI availability coming soon. 

 OPENAI'S MODELS 'MEMORIZED' COPYRIGHTED CONTENT, NEW STUDY SUGGESTS
(3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A study suggested that OpenAI trained its models on copyrighted
content without permission.
