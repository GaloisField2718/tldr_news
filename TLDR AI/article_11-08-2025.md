HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHATGPT IS BRINGING BACK 4O AS AN OPTION BECAUSE PEOPLE MISSED IT (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has reinstated GPT-4o as an option in ChatGPT following
backlash from users mourning its replacement with GPT-5. Users missed
GPT-4o's perceived personality and flexibility for various tasks, and
OpenAI indicated that Plus users could choose between models. CEO Sam
Altman also stated OpenAI aims to address concerns over GPT-5's
performance and transparency. 

 THE NEXT GROK UPDATE (INTERNALLY V7) FINISHED PRE TRAINING (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The next Grok update is expected to be natively multimodal with
direct audio and video processing. It is also expected to have
improvements in one-shot game generation. The model, internally
labeled V7, will actually 'play' games, look at the screen, and adjust
code to improve both aesthetics and playability. It finished
pretraining last week. 

 ANTHROPIC REVENUE TIED TO TWO CUSTOMERS AS AI PRICING WAR THREATENS
MARGINS (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cursor and GitHub Copilot account for nearly a quarter of Anthropic's
income. OpenAI's GPT-5 launched this week with dramatically lower
pricing. This could undercut Anthropic's premium positioning, creating
immediate pressure on Anthropic's pricing strategy and potentially
threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding. The pricing disparity
will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor
relationships and create unavoidable pressure in contract
negotiations.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WINDSURF GETS MARGIN CALLED (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Windsurf managed to become one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies
in history, but its founders gave it all away for almost free over a
weekend. The business went from $0-$82M ARR in 8 months, and the best
offer was for a less than 2x multiple. This article looks at what was
so broken that the founders would rather leave it behind for almost
nothing. Windsurf was an accidentally subsidized training program, and
its most valuable output was coders who knew how to build coding
models. 

 THREE MACRO PREDICTIONS ON AI (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Just like calculators didn't make students dumb, large language
models aren't going to turn people into mental degenerates who can't
flex their brains at all without consulting an assistant. The industry
and young people will eventually adapt to the technology, but there is
likely going to be a transition period. Artificial General
Intelligence isn't coming anytime soon. It might one day be achieved,
but we don't have a clear way of getting there, and nothing right now
seems to be that promising. While current models might feel magical,
it's important to understand their fundamental limitations. 

 FROM GPT-2 TO GPT-OSS: ANALYZING THE ARCHITECTURAL ADVANCES (25
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 After six years of keeping its models locked up, OpenAI's gpt-oss
makes some bold architectural bets that go against industry consensus,
using just 32 large experts instead of the hundreds of smaller ones
favored by competitors like Qwen3. The gpt-oss models employ
alternating sliding-window attention layers and MXFP4 quantization,
which allows them to match the performance of much larger systems. 

 GPT-5: A SMALL STEP FOR INTELLIGENCE, A GIANT LEAP FOR NORMAL PEOPLE
(16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GPT-5 delivers less for the power user and more for the common user.
The 98% of people on ChatGPT's free tier now get a more powerful base
model, albeit without extended thinking. GPT-5 is easier to use -
users don't have to worry about which model they're using, as the
model just figures out what it needs to do. While GPT doesn't deliver
the next generation of intelligence, it provides new value to the
typical customer. With GPT-5, OpenAI is doubling down on speed,
usability, and revenue by focusing on the bottlenecks for most
real-world use cases: cost, latency, and reliability.

 HOW OPENAI USED A NEW DATA TYPE TO CUT INFERENCE COSTS BY 75% (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 OpenAI's new data type, MXFP4, promises massive compute savings
compared to traditional data types used by large language models. The
company's recently released gpt-oss models are among the first
mainstream models to take advantage of it. MXFP4 can significantly cut
compute and memory requirements - it is how OpenAI was able to cram a
120 billion parameter model into a GPU with just 80GB of VRAM, or the
smaller 20 billion parameter version on one with as little as 16GB of
memory. This article details how the format works. 

 PERPLEXITY'S INTEGRATION OF GPT-OSS MODELS (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Perplexity has detailed how it integrated OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b and
gpt-oss-120b models into its in-house ROSE inference engine on NVIDIA
H200 GPUs. The post covers kernel adjustments, quantization
trade-offs, and the minimal infrastructure changes needed to support
the models on non-FP4 hardware. 

 AGENTFLAYER: CHATGPT CONNECTORS 0CLICK ATTACK (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers discovered a zero-click attack exploiting ChatGPT's
connector feature to steal data from Google Drive and other services.
Attackers embed invisible prompt injections in documents that, when
uploaded to ChatGPT, instruct the AI to search connected drives and
embed stolen data in image URLs. The malicious prompts then embed
stolen data as URL parameters in rendered images hosted on trusted
Azure Blob storage. 

 HOW ATTENTION SINKS KEEP LANGUAGE MODELS STABLE (15 MINUTE READ) [17]


 Large language models catastrophically fail on long conversations.
This is because models dump massive attention into the first few
tokens as 'attention sinks'. One solution to this problem is to keep
the first four tokens permanently while sliding the window for
everything else. This enables the stable processing of millions of
tokens instead of just thousands.

 LLMS AREN'T WORLD MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Large language models aren't sufficient as a path to general machine
intelligence. They will never manage to deal with large codebases
autonomously because they are incapable of forming models about the
program. These models will never reliably know what they don't know or
stop making things up. They are able to teach students complex
curricula and answer expert questions, but they fail at basic novel
questions on the same subject because that requires a world model. 

 U.S. GOVERNMENT IMPOSES FEE ON NVIDIA, AMD EXPORTS TO CHINA (2 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 The US government will levy a 15% fee on some of Nvidia's and AMD's
chip sales to China as a condition of granting them export licenses to
sell in the country. The deal applies specifically to Nvidia's H20
chip and AMD's MI308, which are both crucial to AI applications. It is
unclear how the government will deploy the presumed billions of
dollars in fees it will collect. Nvidia says that being blocked from
selling its chips to China cost the company $4.5 billion in one
quarter alone. 

 FROM BOOTCAMP TO BUST: HOW AI IS UPENDING THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
INDUSTRY (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI has devastated the coding bootcamp industry by automating away the
entry-level programming roles these programs traditionally filled.
Bootcamp job placement rates have plummeted from 83% to 37% at some
schools, and new graduate hiring has dropped 50% from pre-pandemic
levels.
