HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GPT-5.3-CODEX-SPARK (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a smaller ultra-fast coding
model optimized for real-time use in Codex and capable of generating
over 1,000 tokens per second on low-latency hardware. 

 GEMINI 3 DEEP THINK UPGRADE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google released a major upgrade to Gemini 3 Deep Think, its
specialized reasoning mode, expanding access to Ultra subscribers and
select API users. The update was developed with researchers to better
handle open-ended scientific and engineering problems with messy or
incomplete data. 

 ANTHROPIC RAISED $30B AT $380B VALUATION (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic raised $30 billion in Series G funding at a $380 billion
post-money valuation, led by GIC and Coatue with broad institutional
participation.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPTIMAL TIMING FOR SUPERINTELLIGENCE (72 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Developing superintelligence is like undergoing risky surgery for a
condition that would otherwise prove fatal. Some have called for a
pause or permanent halt to AI development as AGI could pose
existential risks. However, poorly implemented pauses could do more
harm than good. The optimal strategy is to move quickly to AGI
capability, then pause briefly before full development. 

 I IMPROVED 15 LLMS AT CODING IN ONE AFTERNOON. ONLY THE HARNESS
CHANGED (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There's no real consensus on the best solution to the simple 'how do
you change things' problem. None of the current tools give models a
stable, verifiable identifier for the lines to be changed without
wasting tremendous amounts of context and depending on perfect recall.
This post discusses a solution where, when a model reads a file, or
greps for something, every line comes back tagged with a 2-3 character
content hash, and when the model edits, it references those tags. This
approach can result in an over 8% improvement in Gemini's success rate
with zero training compute cost. 

 LEADING INFERENCE PROVIDERS CUT AI COSTS BY UP TO 10X WITH OPEN
SOURCE MODELS ON NVIDIA BLACKWELL (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Leading inference providers like Baseten, DeepInfra, and Together AI
are cutting AI costs by up to 10x using open source models on NVIDIA
Blackwell GPUs. In healthcare, companies like Sully.ai reduced
inference expenses, improving response times and freeing up valuable
time for doctors. In gaming and customer service, NVIDIA Blackwell's
optimized platforms enable Latitude and Decagon to slash token costs
while enhancing user experiences and managing high workloads
effectively.

 REAL-WORLD AGENT EVALUATION (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 OpenEnv is an open-source framework from Meta and Hugging Face that
standardizes how agents interact with real, stateful environments via
a gym-style API and MCP tool interface. A production-grade calendar
environment illustrated the challenges of evaluating tool-using agents
under realistic constraints such as access control and long-horizon
reasoning. 

 MATH RESEARCH AGENT FROM DEEPMIND (34 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 DeepMind introduced Aletheia, a math research agent powered by an
advanced version of Gemini Deep Think that iteratively generates and
verifies long-horizon proofs using intensive tool support. 

 MINIMAX'S NEW OPEN M2.5 AND M2.5 LIGHTNING NEAR STATE-OF-THE-ART
WHILE COSTING 1/20TH OF CLAUDE OPUS 4.6 (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Minimax has released two new variants of its M2.5 language model.
While it is supposed to be open source, the weights and code have yet
to be posted, nor has the company indicated the exact license type or
terms. The models drop the cost of inference by as much as 95% while
delivering performance that rivals top-tier models. They can be
accessed through MiniMax's API and those of partners.

 CURSOR EXPANDS LONG-RUNNING AGENTS PREVIEW (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cursor expanded access to its long-running agents research preview
for Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise users. The custom harness enabled
agents to complete longer, more complex coding tasks, producing larger
pull requests with merge rates comparable to other agents. 

 THE AI ADVANTAGE NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT (7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI is not eliminating expertise; it's shifting the bottleneck from
production to evaluation. Anyone can now generate “passable”
output quickly, but true judgment, pattern recognition, and domain
knowledge remain scarce. Professionals who combine deep expertise with
AI fluency multiply their impact, while those who rely solely on
prompting or ignore AI fall behind.
