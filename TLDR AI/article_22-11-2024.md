 FYI: AI IS ALREADY MAKING ONE MILLION PHONE CALLS A DAY ON BEHALF OF
SOME COMPANIES 🤯 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 👋 Say hi to Bland, the world's most realistic AI phone-calling
agent [4]

Chances are, you've already spoken to it without even noticing... It
can:

🗣️ Respond in any voice or language.

🦾 It's already handling 1M+ phone calls simultaneously - 24/7 - for
some of the world's largest businesses.

For enterprises [5], it's been a financial game changer across sales,
operations, customer support, you name it. It's like the perfect
employee.

Pretty wild, huh? Here, give it a call yourself [4].

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 BFL LAUNCHES FLUX TOOLS (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 FLUX.1 Tools is a suite of models designed to add control and
steerability to the text-to-image model FLUX.1. It contains a number
of utilities and model checkpoints that allow for editability based on
the FLUX models. It enables inpainting, outpainting, and some
controlnets. The tools are useful for those looking to improve their
creative suite on top of some of the best models out there. 

 ELON MUSK ASKED PEOPLE TO UPLOAD THEIR HEALTH DATA. X USERS OBLIGED
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Users are submitting medical images to X's AI chatbot Grok for
diagnoses, a practice encouraged by Elon Musk despite concerns over
accuracy and privacy. Unlike secure medical environments, Grok's
interface lacks HIPAA protection, raising ethical issues about data
usage. While AI's potential in healthcare is significant, experts warn
of the dangers of inaccurate results and privacy breaches. 

 ELEVENLABS NOW OFFERS ABILITY TO BUILD CONVERSATIONAL AI AGENTS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ElevenLabs has launched a platform for building customizable
conversational AI bots. The platform allows users to adjust variables
like tone and response length and integrate custom LLMs. The company
aims to compete with OpenAI and others by offering flexible model and
voice options.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TÜLU 3: THE NEXT ERA IN OPEN POST-TRAINING (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Open source, frontier level, post training recipe with open data,
training code, model weights, and scientific insights. Potentially the
best source of knowledge on modern post training for large language
models. 

 A STATISTICAL APPROACH TO MODEL EVALUATIONS (21 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When two models are compared on a benchmark, and one of them is
declared better than the other, it's hard to have much confidence in
that declaration. This work from Anthropic explores some nice
statistical methods that can be used to truly determine when one model
outperforms. 

 SOLVING COLD STARTS IN ADAPTIVE TESTING (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The "cold start" problem in adaptive testing is where initial
questions poorly match examinees' abilities. To combat this,
researchers have developed the Diffusion Cognitive States Transfer
Framework (DCSR), which uses diffusion models to leverage prior
learning data across domains.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SAMURAI: ADAPTING SEGMENT ANYTHING MODEL FOR ZERO-SHOT VISUAL
TRACKING WITH MOTION-AWARE MEMORY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Long tracking of a consistent object over time can be pretty
challenging. This work builds on SAM 2 and improves it with motion
aware memory banks that keep consistency over time and through
occlusions. It is one of the better visual tracking systems built to
date. 

 COMPRESS AND RECONSTRUCT IMAGES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PCNet is a new compact network for image-compressed sensing. It
reduces sampling costs while delivering high-quality reconstructions. 

 COMBINING CAPTION GENERATION AND COMPRESSION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Large multi-modal models can generate captions and compress images
simultaneously within a single system. 

🎁 

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOFTWARE IS A TEAM SPORT (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 2.8 million users, enhances developer
experience with features like AI-powered code completion, debugging,
and secure code reviews. Developers can choose AI models from
providers like OpenAI and Google in Visual Studio Code. Integration
with Azure and tools like GitHub Actions streamline cloud deployments
and CI/CD processes. 

 PROMPT INJECTING YOUR WAY TO SHELL: OPENAI'S CONTAINERIZED CHATGPT
ENVIRONMENT (19 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article explores the interactive capabilities within OpenAI's
Debian-based sandbox environment for ChatGPT, uncovering unexpected
insights into its structure. Users can execute Python scripts,
manipulate files, and potentially reveal core instructions via prompt
engineering. This has provoked discussions on transparency and
privacy. While these interactions are intentional features, OpenAI
does not classify them as security vulnerabilities unless they lead to
sandbox breaches. 

 WE CAN ALL BE AI ENGINEERS – AND WE CAN DO IT WITH OPEN SOURCE
MODELS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Barriers to AI engineering are rapidly diminishing as tools enhance
and workflow standardization simplifies complex processes. Building AI
apps now requires using basic engineering knowledge to leverage
models, prompts, integrations, tests, and deployment. Open source
models preserve data privacy, while existing DevOps tools facilitate
AI app development and management.

 AI BRIDGES SCIENCE, ART, AND MUSIC (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A new AI method developed by an MIT professor uncovered unexpected
connections between fields like biology, music, and art through an
integration of generative AI with graph-based reasoning. 

 NEW OPENAI EMAILS REVEAL A LONG HISTORY OF MISTRUST (4 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Emails from 2017 revealed that Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever had
doubts about Sam Altman's motivations for leading OpenAI and
questioned his trustworthiness. 

 MUSK'S AMENDED LAWSUIT AGAINST OPENAI NAMES MICROSOFT AS DEFENDANT (5
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI alleges the company abandoned its
nonprofit mission and unfairly collaborated with Microsoft, harming
competitors like Musk's xAI.
