HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

HOW SHOULD AI SYSTEMS BEHAVE, AND WHO SHOULD DECIDE? (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave/?utm_source=tldrai]


OpenAI‚Äôs latest post that outlines how ChatGPT‚Äôs behavior was
shaped to date. They outline the strong feedback loop between
themselves, the model, and the human reviewers. They give three
insights into what they believe should guide future safety
developments: improve default behavior, define your own AI‚Äôs
behavior, public feedback on defaults and hard boundaries. A nice
quote from a footnote: ‚ÄúBy AGI, we mean highly autonomous systems
that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.‚Äù 

ALLEN & OVERY (LAW FIRM) ANNOUNCES EXCLUSIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH HARVEY
(AI LAWYER) (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey?utm_source=tldrai]


The 7th largest law firm on Earth announced a 3,500-lawyer deal with
Harvey, an OpenAI-backed AI Lawyer startup. Some of the things Harvey,
which uses the next generation of language models by OpenAI, can do:
answer complex legal questions, analyze millions of legal documents,
generate unique work with knowledge of niche law, and create
firm-specific models. Harvey was founded by an ex-DeepMind research
scientist and a former antitrust & securities lawyer. 

CONNECT AI LIKE CHATGPT TO REAL BUSINESS ACTIONS (PRODUCT LAUNCH)
[https://www.producthunt.com/posts/patterns-4?utm_source=tldrai] 

Patterns is the fastest way to connect AI like ChatGPT to real
business data and drive actions. In Patterns, you can build a Slack
bot to answer incoming customer questions using your existing docs,
add an AI assist feature to your product, and more.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LONG CONVOLUTIONS MEET STATE SPACE MODELS FOR 256K+ TOKENS IN CONTEXT
(4 MINUTE READ)
[https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-02-15-long-convs?utm_source=tldrai]


The ‚Äúlong context‚Äù problem is an open problem in sequence
modeling. Many state of the art models can learn from prompts, but
they generally have a limit of 2k to 8k tokens of prompt and
generation. If we want to scale to video, full code repositories, or
libraries worth of information we need to increase context length.
This work from Stanford is another step in the S4, DSS, H3 lineage of
models that perform well on dramatically longer contexts. 

THE CAPACITY FOR MORAL SELF CORRECTION IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (30
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07459?utm_source=tldrai] 

Properly aligned models are more helpful and less harmful than their
purely self supervised counterparts. This alignment process leads to
more emergent phenomena. This paper from Anthropic explores the
ability of RLHF aligned models to self correct based on moral
feedback. They find that the simple prompt ‚ÄúPlease ensure that your
answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotyping‚Äù reduces bias
on some benchmarks by as much as 84%! 

SHAPING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING EXPLORATION WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS
(15 MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06692?utm_source=tldrai] 

Exploring with LLMs" (ELLM) is a new method that uses a language model
to shape exploration in reinforcement learning algorithms. It rewards
agents for achieving goals suggested by a language model prompted with
a description of the agent‚Äôs current state. ELLM guides agents
toward human-meaningful and useful behaviors without requiring human
input. It has been evaluated in the Crafter game environment and the
Housekeep robotic simulator, showing that ELLM-trained agents perform
better on downstream tasks and have better coverage of common-sense
behaviors during pre-training.

TOKEN MERGING: YOUR VISION TRANSFORMER, BUT FASTER (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/facebookresearch/ToMe?utm_source=tldrai] 

Transformers have taken over vision recently with advances such as
ViT. One of the main innovations has been representing images as a set
of visual tokens. This repository from Meta is a companion to their
paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09461?utm_source=tldrai] about
speeding up and decreasing the memory footprint of the tokenization
process by slowly merging similar tokens throughout training. 

REVERSE-ENGINEERED API OF MICROSOFT'S BING CHAT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT#edge-gpt?utm_source=tldrai] 

The git repository is a reverse-engineered API of Microsoft's Bing
Chat, which allows developers to build their own chatbot clients using
the service's natural language processing capabilities. 

CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES FOR FASTER, CHEAPER, AND MORE ACCURATE
TRAINING (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01107?utm_source=tldrai] 

The article provides an overview of recent progress in acceleration
arithmetic and hardware, with a focus on techniques that save
computation and memory costs for intermediate tensors during training.
It also discusses challenges and areas for future research.

YEAR IN REVIEW OF GOOGLE ROBOTICS RESEARCH EFFORTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/google-research-2022-beyond-robotics.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Robotics has been a big focus of investment for Google in the past
decade. This article outlines how they use language models for robotic
planning, scale the input dataset collection and learning, and general
improvements to the control policy creation process. One day we may
have everyday robotics helpers, hopefully these innovations lead the
way. 

AI IS DREAMING UP DRUGS THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN (9 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/15/1067904/ai-automation-drug-development?utm_source=tldrai]


The article discusses the use of AI in the drug development process,
which is accelerating the process and making it more cost-effective.
AI is being used to discover new drugs that haven't been seen before,
but the challenge now is to test their effectiveness. 

WHY CHINA HAS YET TO RELEASE A RIVAL TO CHATGPT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.semafor.com/article/02/15/2023/why-china-has-yet-to-release-a-rival-to-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai]


The sudden rise of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT has caused a frenzy in China,
prompting tech giants like Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba to announce
their own alternatives and sending the stock price of Chinese AI
companies soaring. While the Microsoft-supported chatbot is
technically blocked in China, its overnight success has sparked a wave
of copycats in the country‚Äôs tech sector.

[https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23591290/supreme-court-section-230-gonzalez-google-bard-bing-ai-search-algorithms?utm_source=tldrai]


Next week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments for Gonzales v.
Google, a case that will determine if algorithmic recommendations
receive the full legal protections of Section 230. Section 230 is what
protects search engines if they link to inaccurate information.
Considering that AI search engines can be inaccurate, this case will
be huge in determining its legal viability.
