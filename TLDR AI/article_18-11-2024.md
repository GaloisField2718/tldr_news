HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INSIDE OPENAI'S EARLY DRAMA (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A lawsuit by Elon Musk against OpenAI has resulted in emails from the
startup's early days being revealed, shedding light on internal
tensions. 

 ANTHROPIC HIRES ITS FIRST “AI WELFARE” RESEARCHER (5 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Anthropic hired Kyle Fish as its first "AI welfare" researcher to
explore ethical considerations around potential AI consciousness and
moral rights. This marks a potential shift for AI companies in
addressing ethical questions related to AI systems' consciousness and
agency. Fish's recent paper discusses improving AI welfare
understanding to avoid mishandling decisions concerning AI moral
consideration. 

 SPOTIFY'S PLANS FOR AI GENERATED MUSIC, PODCASTS, AND
RECOMMENDATIONS, ACCORDING TO ITS CO-PRESIDENT, CTO, AND CPO GUSTAV
SÖDERSTRÖM (37 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Spotify is embracing AI-powered content creation, using generative AI
tools like Suno and NotebookLM for music and podcasts while leveraging
LLMs to enhance user recommendations. Co-President Gustav Söderström
says AI is a tool for amplifying creativity rather than replacing it
and that AI has the potential to foster deeper user engagement and
personalized experiences. Spotify remains committed to supporting
creators on its platform, ensuring legal compliance while exploring
dynamic AI-driven innovation.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLAMA MESH (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fine-tuned model from Nvidia based on LlaMA that can generate
vertices for 3D models based on textual input. 

 SEMANTIC AWARE WATERMARKING (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers introduce the Semantic Perturbation Attack to counter
existing attacks on watermarking schemes. 

 SOLVING THE TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study reveals the overlooked importance of the “heatmap +
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)” approach, showing that careful
tuning and simple heatmaps can outperform complex models.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 TIRED OF SELF-CENSORING AI THAT DOESN'T RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY?
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 What if LLMs weren't censored by big tech and didn't track your every
interaction? Try Venice - the zero censorship, fully private AI.
Generate text with a variety of open source models, create any image
you want, interact with AI characters, or generate working code. Try
Venice [10] or get 20% off Venice Pro with code TLDR20 [10]. 

 RUN LENGTH TOKENIZATION FOR VIDEO TRANSFORMERS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 You can dramatically speed up run time with no loss in performance
without additional training by adaptively caching video tokens that
have not changed over frames. 

 REGION AWARE TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 An improved technique for generating images with improved control
based on chosen regions. 

 ACCURATE IMAGE MATCHING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MOP+MiHo+NCC is a non-deep, modular approach for refining image
matches by combining three techniques. Multiple Overlapping Planes
(MOP) clusters inlier matches and filters outliers with RANSAC. Middle
Homography (MiHo) reduces distortion in planar reprojection.
Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) refines keypoint positions after
transformation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GRAPH-BASED AI MODEL MAPS THE FUTURE OF INNOVATION (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 MIT researchers developed an AI model using generative knowledge
extraction and graph reasoning to uncover complex patterns linking
diverse fields like biology and music. The model efficiently creates
knowledge maps from scientific papers, identifying connections and
suggesting innovative materials inspired by art. This approach
enhances interdisciplinary research, revealing hidden insights and
novel concepts for material design. 

 THE BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO VISUAL PROMPT INJECTIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [15]


 Visual prompt injections pose security risks for LLMs like GPT-4V by
embedding malicious instructions in images, leading to unintended
model behavior. These vulnerabilities can manipulate outputs, such as
ignoring individuals in images or altering described contexts. As
GenAI adoption grows, companies need robust security measures to
mitigate these threats. 

 WHAT IF AI DOESN'T JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER FOREVER? (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Reports indicate that traditional LLM training may be hitting
diminishing returns, as new models like OpenAI's Orion are not
significantly outperforming predecessors. Experts are concerned about
running out of quality textual data for LLM training, prompting shifts
towards synthetic data and specialized AI models. Future advancements
might focus on reasoning improvements and task-specific models rather
than general scaling.
