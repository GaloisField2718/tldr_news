 BECOME CLOUD-AGNOSTIC WITH 99.99% UPTIME (NO MORE OUTAGE SCRAMBLING)
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Baseten recently outlined their multi-cloud capacity management (MCM)
infrastructure for generative AI workloads. Baseten's MCM unifies 10+
clouds into a global GPU pool enabling infinite scaling and 99.99%
uptime for generative AI workloads. 

What that means for you:

	* 😎 Don't go down when a single cloud does 
	* 🌎 Horizontally scale across cloud providers 
	* 📈 Seamlessly scale up during peak demand (even with virality) 
	* ✅ No downtime for your end users due to infra challenges 
	* 🚕 On demand compute, pay only for what you use

 COGNITION ACQUIRES WINDSURF (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cognition scooped up Windsurf's remaining 250-person team and $82
million ARR business after Google's $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire
cherry-picked only the leadership, leaving employees behind without
payouts. The acquisition gives Cognition both AI coding agents and IDE
capabilities to compete with Cursor's $500 million ARR, and restores
Windsurf's access to Claude models that Anthropic had cut off amid
rumors of an OpenAI acquisition. 

 META WEIGHING SHIFT AWAY FROM OPEN SOURCE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The newly formed superintelligence lab is considering abandoning its
flagship open-source Behemoth model in favor of closed development,
marking a potential philosophical shift from the company's
long-standing commitment to open AI.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 LLM DAYDREAMING (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LLMs don't have background processes that allow the model to form
connections between seemingly unrelated topics similar to how humans
make new realizations while "daydreaming." This is the reason AIs have
yet to make any new discoveries. This post proposes a remedy: a system
that would prompt LLMs to randomly retrieve facts, generate novel
connections between them, then use a critic model to filter for
genuinely valuable insights. 

 DID WINDSURF SELL TOO CHEAP? THE WILD 72-HOUR SAGA AND AI CODING
VALUATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google acquired key members of Windsurf for $2.4 billion after
OpenAI's $3 billion offer expired, while Cognition took over the
remaining company. Despite Windsurf's impressive $82 million ARR and
rapid growth, the loss of Anthropic API access and leadership exits
weakened its market position. The AI coding industry's inflated
valuations, driven by talent wars and platform dependencies, suggest
Windsurf's sale price may have been below its potential value.

 GEMINI EMBEDDING NOW GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN THE GEMINI API (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Google's first Gemini Embedding text model is now generally available
to developers in the Gemini API and Vertex AI. The model provides a
unified cutting-edge experience across domains. It supports over a
hundred languages and has a 2,048 maximum input token length. The
Gemini Embedding model is priced at $0.15 per million input tokens. 

 AWS PREVIEWS KIRO IDE FOR DEVELOPERS WHO ARE OVER VIBE CODING (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Kiro is a Claude-powered "agentic IDE" that addresses the quality
problems of AI-generated code by first producing specifications and
user stories before generating actual code. The tool aims to move
beyond "vibe coding" and reduce the time developers spend debugging
and reviewing AI-generated code. 

 ENERGY-BASED TRANSFORMERS ARE SCALABLE LEARNERS AND THINKERS (32
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Energy-Based Transformers replace direct prediction with learned
verification functions that assign compatibility scores between inputs
and candidate outputs. The architecture is first to out-scale standard
Transformers as it allows models to dynamically allocate computation
and self-verify predictions without external supervision, achieving up
to 35% higher scaling rates.

 FEATURED NOTEBOOKS FOR BETTER RESEARCH IN NOTEBOOKLM (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Google introduced "featured notebooks" in NotebookLM, offering
curated research collections from experts and institutions to help
users explore topics with high-quality sources. 

 ANTHROPIC, GOOGLE, OPENAI, AND XAI GRANTED UP TO $200 MILLION FOR AI
WORK FROM DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The US Department of Defense is granting contract awards of up to
$200 million for artificial intelligence development at Anthropic,
Google, OpenAI, and xAI. The awards will help the agency accelerate
its adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national
security challenges. The companies will work to develop AI agents
across several mission areas. AI will transform the DoD's ability to
support fighters and maintain strategic advantage over adversaries.
