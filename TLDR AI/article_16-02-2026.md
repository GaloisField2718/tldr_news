 OPENCLAW: HOW TO SECURELY ADOPT THE NEWEST AI AGENT SENSATION
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot and MoltBot) is an open-source agent
assistant that operates with the same permissions as the user who
installs it - and can act on their behalf.

With over 120,000 GitHub stars and 20,000 forks, OpenClaw is so
popular because of its efficacy - it's risky for the same reason.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENCLAW CREATOR JOINS OPENAI (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenClaw's creator will join OpenAI to develop accessible agents and
ensure OpenClaw remains open and independent within a new foundation.
OpenAI's support will provide access to cutting-edge models and
resources, aligning with the creator's vision of making these tools
widely usable. OpenClaw's community will benefit from a supportive
structure that encourages innovation and data ownership. 

 CHATGPT'S LOCKDOWN MODE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI introduced an optional Lockdown Mode for higher-risk workflows
and added “Elevated Risk” labels for capabilities in ChatGPT,
ChatGPT Atlas, and Codex that can increase exposure to
prompt-injection attacks. 

 XAI TESTS ARENA MODE WITH PARALLEL AGENTS FOR GROK BUILD (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 xAI's Grok Build plans to introduce Parallel Agents and Arena Mode,
enhancing its capabilities from a coding assistant to a full IDE.
Parallel Agents allows up to eight coding agents to work
simultaneously, while Arena Mode facilitates competition among agents
to determine the best output. The update also includes a new UI
resembling a browser-based IDE, dictation support, and nonfunctional
GitHub integration, with Grok 4.20 expected soon.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WHY I DON'T THINK AGI IS IMMINENT (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Both CEOs of OpenAI and Anthropic claim that human-level AI is just
around the corner. However, Transformers have their fundamental
limitations. While they are very powerful and have taught us a lot
about what general intelligence is, overcoming these problems will
require research that could take decades. The advances that made
modern GPTs possible were discovered gradually over several decades,
and each discovery came with new and more nuanced issues. 

 THE PROBLEM ISN'T OPENCLAW. IT'S THE ARCHITECTURE. (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 OpenClaw's recent security issues highlight a larger problem with
agent ecosystems as new attack surfaces, where malicious skills can
exploit agent + tools + marketplace combinations. Current safeguards
like prompts are inadequate. Agents need sandboxing, scoped
credentials, restricted tools, and proper logging to manage risks. 

 TWO DIFFERENT TRICKS FOR FAST LLM INFERENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic and OpenAI have unveiled new "fast modes" for LLM
inference, offering differing performance enhancements. OpenAI's model
speeds exceed 1,000 tokens per second using Cerebras chips, but rely
on a less capable model, while Anthropic's fast mode supports real
models with up to 2.5x speed through low-batch-size inference. Despite
OpenAI's technical achievement, the utility of faster but less capable
inference remains debatable, focusing more on OpenAI's exploration of
Cerebras' potential. 

 REVERSE-ENGINEERING THE OPENAI'S GPT-5 TOKENIZER: WHAT 200,000 TOKENS
REVEAL ABOUT AEO/GEO (52 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Text has to pass through a tokenizer before GPT-5.x is able to
understand any input. A tokenizer is a compression layer that converts
raw text into a sequence of integer IDs. Every design decision baked
into the tokenizer has downstream consequences for cost, accuracy,
multilingual performance, and hallucination rates. This article looks
at OpenAI's open-source tokenizer library, tiktoken, and explains how
it works.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 SCALING HUMAN JUDGEMENT TO UNLOCK QUALITY IN AI SYSTEMS (SPONSOR)
[13] 

 Human judgment is the backbone of AI quality. Yet most orgs scaling
AI lack clear decision frameworks, consistent interpretation policies,
and reliable oversight mechanisms. Welo Data [14] builds AI data
quality systems that govern human and machine judgment. Turns out that
judgment works when it's designed, not assumed. Talk to an expert [15]


 INTELLIGENT AI DELEGATION (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI agents can tackle increasingly complex tasks, but to achieve more
ambitious goals, they need to be able to meaningfully decompose
problems into manageable sub-components and safely delegate their
completion across to other AI agents and humans. This study proposes
an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation. The proposed
framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees
in complex delegation networks. 

 PERSONAPLEX: VOICE AND ROLE CONTROL FOR FULL DUPLEX CONVERSATIONAL
SPEECH MODELS (9 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Personaplex is a real-time speech-to-speech conversational model that
jointly performs streaming speech understanding and speech generation.
It operates on continuous audio and can predict both text tokens and
audio tokens auto-regressively to produce its spoken responses.
Personaplex's design allows the model to update its internal state
based on users' ongoing speech while still producing fluent output
audio, so it can support highly interactive conversations. The model
is ready for commercial use. 

 THE RL ARCHITECTURE BEHIND MINIMAX M2.5, EXPLAINED CLEARLY (11 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Minimax M2.5 is fast, cheap, and great at coding. While the team
behind the model has released a technical article on how the model
works, it is quite dense. This post aims to make the content of that
article more accessible for readers. The core problem the team is
solving is how to make RL work at massive scale for being good at
Agentic AI. Training LLMs to be good at agentic tasks imposes many
challenges: huge volumes of training data need to be processed
quickly, training needs to be stable, and agents need to be good at a
diverse range of tasks. 

 COMPOSED PROMPTS WITH RLVR (16 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Composition-RL reused “too-easy” pass-rate-1 prompts by
automatically combining multiple problems into new verifiable
questions for RLVR training. Across 4B–30B models, the approach
improved reasoning over training on the original dataset.

 NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT GENERALIZED HILL-CLIMBING (AT RUNTIME) (11
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 You have to know where you're going before you take that first step.
The first thing to do is always to define your goal. Reverse engineer
requests and combine that with context to create discrete, boolean,
testable Ideal State Criteria. This criterion can carry through to
become the verification criteria as well. 

 PENTAGON USED ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE IN MADURO VENEZUELA RAID (4 MINUTE
READ) [21] 

 Anthropic's partnership with Palantir means that the Defense
Department and federal law enforcement have access to Claude. This
means it was possible that the technology was used in matters related
to the US military's operation to capture former Venezuelan President
Nicolás Maduro. Anthropic's usage guidelines prohibit Claude from
being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons, or conduct
surveillance. A company spokesperson said that Anthropic has not
discussed the use of Claude for specific operations, but the company
is committed to using frontier AI to support the US in national
security.
