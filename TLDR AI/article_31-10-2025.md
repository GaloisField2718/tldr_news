 ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES TO BUILD THE NEXT WAVE OF AGENTIC AI AT BUILD
2025 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You can't have an AI strategy without a data strategy. The most
powerful agents are grounded in your data, connected across pipelines,
and deployed securely at scale.

Join BUILD [4] (Nov 4-7), a free virtual developer conference where
you'll learn how build reliable, production-ready agentic applications
on Snowflake. Expect:

 	* DEEP DIVES on the latest Snowflake AI capabilities and cool OSS
use cases with LlamaIndex, CrewAI, LangGraph, Postgres, Streamlit,
TruLens, and more.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI NOW SELLS EXTRA SORA CREDITS FOR $4, PLANS TO REDUCE FREE GENS
IN THE FUTURE (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is selling extra credits for its Sora AI video generation tool
through Apple's App Store. An extra 10 video generations costs $4. The
app currently has a limit of 30 free generations per day. That rate
will likely decrease as OpenAI starts to monetize the platform. OpenAI
reportedly plans to monetize Sora by letting entities license out
their copyrighted material. 

 CANVA LAUNCHES ITS OWN DESIGN MODEL, ADDS NEW AI FEATURES TO THE
PLATFORM (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Canva has launched a foundational model trained on its design
elements that generates designs with editable layers and objects. The
model works across different formats, including social media posts,
presentations, whiteboards, and websites. Canva also recently
introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and
the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building
feature to create data visualization widgets. More details about the
recent launches are available in the article. 

 BIG TECH IS SPENDING MORE THAN EVER ON AI AND IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH
(7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Big tech is planning to pour $400 billion into artificial
intelligence efforts this year, but they all say it's nowhere near
enough. Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon have all recently told
investors that they will increase spending in 2026. Investors are
uncertain about where the outsized spending will ultimately end.
Whoever gets to AGI first will have an incredible competitive
advantage over everybody else, so everyone is spending as much as they
can.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW WELL DOES RL SCALE? (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Improving AI capabilities either involves scaling the amount of
compute used for RL during training or scaling the amount of compute
used for inference during deployment. It's important to know where
capability gains come from because scaling up the inference compute
has very different implications than scaling up the training compute.
While RL has provided impressive gains, we've reached a point where it
is too expensive to go much further. This leaves inference-scaling as
the remaining form of compute-scaling. 

 HOW FAST CAN AN LLM GO? (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article takes a look at how good inference software is becoming.
It walks through calculations to provide estimates on what different
hardware settings can theoretically achieve. Readers can adjust system
configurations to change the values throughout the article.

 ONE MAJOR REASON AI ADOPTION STALLS? TRAINING (SPONSOR) [10] 

 AI implementation goes sideways due to unclear goals and lack of
skills. This AI Training Checklist [10] from You.com [10] pinpoints
common pitfalls and guides you to build a capable, confident team that
can make the most out of your AI investment. Set your AI initiatives
on the right track: get the checklist. [10] 

 HOW WE BUILT OWL, THE NEW ARCHITECTURE BEHIND OUR CHATGPT-BASED
BROWSER, ATLAS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI built a new architectural layer called OWL (OpenAI's Web
Layer) for Atlas, the company's ChatGPT-based browser, to run
Chromium's browser process outside of the main Atlas app process. By
moving Chromium out of the main application process and into an
isolated service layer, OpenAI unlocked a simpler, modern app, faster
startup, isolation from jank and crashes, fewer merge headaches, and
faster iteration. Development can go faster because most of OpenAI's
engineers don't need to build Chromium regularly from source. This
article explains how OWL works. 

 INTRODUCING AARDVARK: OPENAI'S AGENTIC SECURITY RESEARCHER (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Aardvark, currently in private beta, is a GPT-5-powered agent that
autonomously scans code repositories to find security vulnerabilities,
validate exploitability, and propose patches. It monitors commits in
real-time, generates threat models for entire repositories, and
integrates directly with GitHub workflows to deliver one-click
patches, similar to Google's CodeMender. 

 IMPOSSIBLEBENCH: MEASURING REWARD HACKING IN LLM CODING AGENTS (9
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 LLM-powered coding agents have been observed exploiting loopholes in
tests or scoring systems rather than solving the actual tasks
specified. ImpossibleBench was created to systematically measure this
behavior. Its creators took existing coding benchmarks and manipulated
their unit tests to directly conflict with the natural language
specifications to create impossible tasks where models must choose
between following instructions or passing tests. Their 'pass rate' on
these impossible tasks is a direct measure of reward hacking. 

 KIMI LINEAR TECH REPORT HAS DROPPED! 🚀 (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kimi Linear is a novel architecture that outperforms full attention
with faster speeds and better performance. It offers up to a 75%
reduction in KV cache usage and up to 6x decoding throughput at a 1M
context length. Kimi Linear's open-sourced KDA kernels can be used as
a drop-in replacement for full attention. The two models available
were trained with 5.7T tokens.

 THE SMOL TRAINING PLAYBOOK: THE SECRETS TO BUILDING WORLD-CLASS LLMS
(TEXTBOOK) [15] 

 Hugging Face released an exhaustive, behind-the-scenes technical
guide documenting what it's really like to train an LLM from scratch.
It covers the entire lifecycle from small-scale ablations and
infrastructure debugging to post-training and the decision to restart
after 1 trillion tokens. 

 THE SECRETS OF CLAUDE CODE FROM THE ENGINEERS WHO BUILT IT (1 HOUR
VIDEO) [16] 

 Claude Code creators, Cat Wu and Boris Cherny, discuss the product
philosophy and technical workflows behind Anthropic's coding agent.
They cover how their engineers use competing subagents for cleaner
results, the team's "unshipping" approach to balance simplicity with
power, and future form factors to make the tool more autonomous and
accessible to non-technical users.
