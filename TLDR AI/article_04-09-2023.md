HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

CONTEXTUAL RAISES $20M TO BRING RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION TO THE
ENTERPRISE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://contextual.ai/announcing-next-generation-language-models/?utm_source=tldrai]

Founded by leaders in the retrieval research domain, this group hopes
to allow enterprises to build on top of generative technologies by
cheaply and effectively using their own data. 

EX-META RESEARCHERS HAVE RAISED $40 MILLION FROM LUX CAPITAL FOR AN AI
BIOTECH STARTUP (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/KDi2v?utm_source=tldrai]

Ex-Meta researchers founded EvolutionaryScale, raising $40M and valued
at $200M to fast-track AI-driven protein structure predictions. With
claims of outpacing Google's AlphaFold in speed, the startup eyes
breakthroughs in medicine and biotech.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

GENERAL PURPOSE AUDIO EFFECT REMOVAL (25 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16177?utm_source=tldrai]

Audio deep learning has seen a revival recently. By using a classifier
followed by effect-specific modules, a general system can be built to
gradually remove effects such as reverb or delay from already mixed
audio. 

MULTIVIEW DIFFUSION BASED 3D GENERATION (29 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16512?utm_source=tldrai]

Another exciting result in the recent string of 3D generation methods.
This time the resulting meshes are globally consistent and
semantically coherent. There is also room to make this technique much
faster. 

HEAD-TO-HEAD RLHF VS RLAIF (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267?utm_source=tldrai]

The first public work on scaling between these two efforts found that
they yield essentially identical final model performance with humans
preferring them ~70% of the time over baselines.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

GAUSSIAN PAINTING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ReshotAI/gaussian-painters?utm_source=tldrai]

If you optimize Gaussian splatting over multiple independent 2D
viewpoints (e.g. unique famous artworks) you get a fabulous
stereographic effect. 

MODULAR DIFFUSION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/cabralpinto/modular-diffusion?utm_source=tldrai]

An easy-to-use modular API to design and train custom Diffusion Models
with PyTorch. 

TEXTBASE (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/cofactoryai/textbase?utm_source=tldrai]

A simple framework for building AI chatbots.

MISCELLANEOUS

CRAFTING GENERATIVE AI PLUGINS WITH WASM (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://dylibso.com/blog/wasm-ai-plugins/?utm_source=tldrai]

WASM, or web assembly, is a compiler target built into modern
browsers. It runs almost as fast as native code and has seen a flurry
of interest. This post walks through how to build a plugin system for
generative apps using WASM. 

WE ANALYZED MILLIONS OF CHATGPT USER SESSIONS (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://sparktoro.com/blog/we-analyzed-millions-of-chatgpt-user-sessions-visits-are-down-29-since-may-programming-assistance-is-30-of-use/?utm_source=tldrai]

This article discusses data around OpenAI and ChatGPT traffic. OpenAI
traffic has declined around 29% since May. Around 29% of ChatGPT
prompts are related to programming, while education accounted for
around 10% of all use cases. Other use cases include writing
assistance, content creation, and creative ideation. Charts showing
data on how people use ChatGPT are available.
