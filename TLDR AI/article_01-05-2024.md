 WINDOW TO INVEST IS CLOSING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 What if you had the opportunity to invest in the biggest electronics
products as they launched into big box retail?

RING changed doorbells and NEST changed thermostats. Early investors
in these smart-home companies earned MASSIVE RETURNS, but the
opportunity to invest was limited to a select, wealthy few.¬†

Not anymore. RYSE [4] has just launched in 100+ Best Buy stores, and
you're in luck ‚Äî you can still invest at only $1.50/SHARE before
their name becomes known nationwide.

They have patented THE ONLY MASS MARKET SHADE AUTOMATION DEVICE [4],
and their exclusive deal with Best Buy resembles that which led Ring
and Nest to their BILLION-DOLLAR BUYOUTS.

The window to invest is closing - learn more here. [4]

 FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS MAKE BAD VISUALIZATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Visualizing eval scores for models is key in today's AI research
world. However, many charts are bad at conveying the intended
information. This repository shows some great charts and comes with
dos and don'ts for visualizing results. 

 META-PROMPTING IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Meta-prompting is a technique that turns a single language model into
a multi-skilled team. This method breaks down complex tasks into
simpler parts, handled by specialized instances of the same model,
leading to significantly improved performance across various tasks.
