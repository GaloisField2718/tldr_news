 MARKET DOWNTURN? PRIVATE CREDIT MIGHT BE YOUR PORTFOLIO'S SAFE HAVEN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 As the stock market reaches new highs, the potential for a correction
could raise concerns for investors heavily exposed to equities.

Private credit's [4] low correlation with public markets can act as a
buffer for your portfolio if equities dip. It's been a go-to for
institutions seeking consistency, even in turbulent times. 

Here's why private credit with Percent [4] can help stabilize your
investments:

 	* LOWER VOLATILITY, HIGHER RESILIENCE: Private credit [4] is less
correlated to equities and bond performance
 	* DOUBLE-DIGIT RETURN POTENTIAL: Percent [4] offers returns with up
to 20% potential
 	* SHORT COMMITMENT PERIODS: Average deal term is around 9 months
 	* STARTING AT $500: Low minimums make it accessible for any
accredited investor

_Protect your portfolio's potential. Earn up to $500 with your first
investment on Percent._ [4]

 OPENAI'S SORA VIDEO GENERATOR APPEARS TO HAVE LEAKED (5 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A group leaked access to OpenAI's unreleased video generator Sora as
a protest against alleged unfair practices and "art washing". They
published a frontend on Hugging Face allowing users to generate
videos, which OpenAI reportedly shut down after a few hours. OpenAI
maintains that Sora is in research preview.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 FUGATTO SOUND MODEL (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nvidia has showcased a new 2B audio model that is far more flexible
than previous models. It can mix and match audio, music, and speech in
novel and interesting ways. 

 OLMO2 (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A continuation of the fully open source training efforts, Allen AI
has released a new generation of language models that are transparent
from top to bottom. They match or surpass the best available open
weight models. 

 A UNIFIED MODEL FOR IMAGE GENERATION AND UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO)
[10] 

 OneDiffusion is a large-scale diffusion model designed for a wide
range of tasks, from text-to-image generation and image editing to
reverse processes like depth estimation and segmentation.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 MOVING FROM THE CLOUD TO LOCAL DESKSIDE AI DEVELOPMENT (SPONSOR) [11]


 Think you need expensive cloud GPUs to develop AI? You might be
mistaken. Join NVIDIA and Dell Technologies for a live webinar [11] on
moving from cloud AI development to a local Precision workstation.

By the end of the session, you will better understand how Dell
Precision workstations, powered by NVIDIA RTX(TM) GPUs, are
revolutionizing local AI development [11] - from data prep to training
and customizing models to deployment.

Save your spot for the live session (December 12) [11]

 CUSTOMIZED FLASH ATTENTION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 New flash attention fork that can have ragged Q/V matrix sizes. 

 NOVEL VIEW SYNTHESIS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 MVGenMaster is a multi-view diffusion model designed to improve Novel
View Synthesis tasks by integrating 3D priors. 

 ADVANCING 3D MOLECULAR DESIGN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This work benchmarks discrete flow matching methods for generating
novel 3D molecular structures, critical for chemical discovery.

MISCELLANEOUS

 LLMS AS A JUDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This project explores the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm where
large language models are used for scoring, ranking, and selection
tasks across various AI and NLP applications. 

 WHEN WE BECOME COGS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI boosts material scientists' efficiency, leading to a 44% increase
in material discoveries but a 44% drop in work satisfaction due to
reduced idea generation tasks. GitHub Copilot enhances productivity
for less skilled developers, shifting focus from project management to
coding. AI narrows skill gaps but risks alienation by automating
creative tasks, echoing past automation impacts in various industries.


 AI ALONE ISN'T READY FOR CHIP DESIGN (16 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hybrid approaches that combine classical search methods and machine
learning are showing promise in overcoming the complexities of chip
design, particularly in floorplanning tasks. While AI alone struggles
with multi-constraint scenarios, integrating AI for guiding
search-based algorithms like simulated annealing enhances efficiency
and effectiveness. This combination can accelerate design processes
and enable more complex chip solutions.
