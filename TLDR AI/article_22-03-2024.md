HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 JAPAN‚ÄôS PREMIER AI LAB LAUNCHES ITS FIRST MODEL (12 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Sakana AI creates state-of-the-art Japanese language, vision, and
image generation models. It introduced an evolutionary model merge
that aims to evolve foundation models without expensive pretraining.
The model merge has been released along with an explanation of the
method. 

 COHERE‚ÄôS COMMAND-R ENTERPRISE MODEL COMING TO AI.NVIDIA.COM (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cohere‚Äôs newly launched RAG-optimized Command-R model, designed for
businesses to get into large-scale production, is coming to the
recently launched NVIDIA API catalog. 

 BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES DEAL WITH INTEL FOR AI CHIPS (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The U.S. Department of Commerce has proposed granting Intel up to
$8.5 billion under the CHIPS and Science Act to support semiconductor
projects in multiple states. This funding aims to bolster U.S. chip
manufacturing, develop critical technologies like AI, and create
thousands of jobs. Intel's planned $100 billion investment in
expansion is one of the largest in U.S. semiconductor history.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SCENE SCRIPT 3D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta Reality Labs has trained a model that takes visual input and
translates it into a 3D representation of a scene. The 70m parameter
model runs quickly on-device and exhibits extreme stability. 

 IMAGE GENERATION WITH DIFFUSION STATE SPACE MODELS (22 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Diffusion State Space Models (DiS) are a new type of diffusion model
that use a state space backbone instead of the traditional U-Net for
image data. These models can handle long-range dependencies and are
efficient in generating high-quality images with less computational
effort. 

 LLM‚ÄôS ABSTRACT THINKING DATASET (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PuzzleVQA is a dataset designed to test the abstract reasoning
capabilities of large multimodal models like GPT-4V.

 CODY ‚Äî THE AI CODING ASSISTANT THAT UNDERSTANDS YOUR CODE BASE
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Every day, Sourcegraph‚Äôs Cody [11] helps developers write >150,000
lines of code. Here‚Äôs how:
AUTOCOMPLETE: Cody autocompletes single lines or whole functions in
any programming language [11], configuration file, or documentation.

CHAT WITH YOUR CODE: How is this repository structured? What does this
file do? Where is X component defined? Why isn‚Äôt this code working?
Cody knows the answers [11].

GENERATE, TEST, AND FIX CODE WITH ONE-CLICK COMMANDS [11]: Explain
code or entire repositories, generate unit tests, or define your own
custom commands.

‚ÄúI've started using Cody this week and dude, absolute gamechanger‚Äù

 TORCHTUNE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Meta has released a native PyTorch library for fine-tuning language
models. 

 MEDICAL ANOMALY DETECTION WITH ADAPTED CLIP MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13]


 This project introduces a framework that repurposes the CLIP model
for medical anomaly detection by incorporating multi-level residual
adapters and visual-language alignment loss functions. 

 3D RECONSTRUCTION WITH FEDERATED LEARNING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Fed3DGS introduces a federated learning framework for scalable 3D
reconstruction, utilizing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) to enable
decentralized scene building across vast areas.

 IMPRESSION WITH GPT 4 EARLY ACCESS FINE TUNING (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The GPT-4 fine-tuning API allows you to create a custom version of
GPT-4 that can be 3x better at 1.5x the cost. 

 AI AND THE FUTURE OF WORK (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's latest AI, Claude, achieves high scores on Mensa tests,
signaling proximity to self-improving AI and posing both opportunities
and existential risks. Machine learning is already displacing jobs, as
evident at Klarna, where a customer service AI replaced 700 agents,
hinting at an accelerating trend in automation. Duolingo's recent
layoffs due to AI's translation capabilities further underscore this
shift, emphasizing the growing impact of AI on the future of work. 

 TWO YEARS LATER, DEEP LEARNING IS STILL FACED WITH THE SAME
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Two years after publishing a skeptical AI article, Gary Marcus
revisits his predictions and stands by his initial skepticism. Despite
advancements like GPT-4, fundamental issues like genuine comprehension
and trustworthy AI remain unresolved. Marcus concludes that scaling up
data and computing power alone won't achieve AGI, and
interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial.
