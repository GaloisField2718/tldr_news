 WHEN AI DELIVERS VARIABLE VALUE, FLAT PRICING DOESN'T WORK. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 AI processes 50 emails for one customer and 5,000 for another.
Document tools handle 100 pages for startups and 100,000 for
enterprises. Same feature, wildly different value. Legacy billing
systems can't comprehend this [5].

Companies that try to build modern products on outdated billing
infrastructure wind up stuck in endless iteration cycles. Emerging
winners like OpenAI can respond to market changes in hours instead of
quarters because their pricing systems are flexible enough to keep up
with product velocity.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 VOICE STARTUP ELEVENLABS LAUNCHES AI MUSIC SERVICE (4 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 ElevenLabs has launched a new service called Eleven Music that lets
users generate music with artificial intelligence. Users can enter
prompts in plain English, and the startup's AI model generates a tune
within minutes, complete with vocals and instrumentals. ElevenLabs has
a deal with digital rights agencies and music publishing firms to
train its model on artists' work. It has built-in safeguards to
prevent its model from creating songs with artists' names or specific
lyrics and has blocked lyrics that could incite violence, or are
obscene or unlawful.

 INDEPENDENT BENCHMARKS OF OPENAI'S GPT-OSS MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [9]


 This post breaks down OpenAI's most recent release and compares it to
other open weights models. gpt-oss-120b is the most intelligent open

 THE CIRCUITS RESEARCH LANDSCAPE: RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES (42 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Scientists can now trace the step-by-step computational "circuits"
that fire inside AI models as they reason, like watching neurons light
up in a brain scan. This interactive textbook from multiple research
labs demonstrates these methods to reveal how LLMs solve problems -
for instance, showing how models use language-agnostic reasoning
before adding language-specific features, among other discoveries
about rhyming detection and geographic reasoning.

security issues in their codebases. 

 IT'S OWL IN THE NUMBERS: TOKEN ENTANGLEMENT IN SUBLIMINAL LEARNING
(11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Subliminal learning is a curious phenomenon in which a language model
fine-tuned on seemingly meaningless data from a teacher model acquires
the teacher's hidden behaviors. Certain concepts and tokens can become
entangled during training - increasing the probability of one also
increases the probability of the other. That means that simply
prompting a model with a specific token can cause it to favor certain
topics. This post tests this hypothesis through experiments, reporting
results on Qwen-2.5 7B instruct. 

 ROBUST LEARNING WITH NOISY LABELS (18 MINUTE READ) [13]

 ELON MUSK DOES REVERSE POACHING FROM MARK ZUCKERBERG'S AI TEAM:
‘XAI HAS MORE POTENTIAL THAN META' (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Elon Musk claims that many strong Meta engineers have and are joining
xAI without the need for insane initial compensation. Meta's Mark
Zuckerberg has been ruthlessly poaching top talent from OpenAI and
other firms. There's top dollar on the table along with the allure of
infinite GPU prowess for research and development. Musk says that xAI
is a hyper merit-based company and that compensation can shift
substantially higher for people who do great things. 

 'WE DON'T BELIEVE IN WORK-LIFE BALANCE': A NEWLY ACQUIRED STARTUP
JUST OFFERED ITS 200-PERSON TEAM A CHOICE — WORK WEEKENDS OR TAKE A
BUYOUT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cognition, which bought competitor Windsurf less than a month ago,
has offered the 200-person team buyouts amounting to nine months'
salary if they don't want to stay and work 80-hour weeks. Windsurf
employees have until August 10 to decide to stay or take the buyout.
Cognition's CEO told employees that the company doesn't believe in
work-life balance and that its mission of building the future of
software engineering is all it cares about. Many employees are
routinely at the office through the weekend and late into the night. 

 HOW CHINA IS GIRDING FOR AN AI BATTLE WITH THE U.S. (11 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 China is ramping up efforts to build a domestic artificial
intelligence ecosystem that can function without Western technology.
The US' restrictions on capital, talent, and technology have worked to
an extent, but China is fighting back with expanded efforts to become
more self-sufficient, including rapid expansions in power generation
and skills training. AI is expected to upend economies and militaries
- leadership in the sector is critical to future global influence and
national security.
