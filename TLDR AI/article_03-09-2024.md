 GITLAB DUO: DELIVER BETTER SOFTWARE, NOT JUST MORE CODE, WITH AI
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Developers only spend 25% of their time writing code. To be
effective, AI must be incorporated across the entire SDLC. GitLab Duo
[4] is the only AI solution that supports developers at every stage of
their workflow.

Your AI companion across the SDLC [4].

Generate tests, explain code and chat in real-time.

Fortify your code with AI-powered security [4].¬†

Understand and remediate vulnerabilities with explanations and
auto-generated merge requests.

AI that prioritizes data privacy. [4]

You control access to AI-powered capabilities. Your code and data are
never used to train AI models.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 XAI STARTS COLOSSUS TRAINING CLUSTER (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI has started the 100,000 Colossus H100 training cluster, the
largest in the world, with plans to double it in size in a few months.


 WHY AI CAN'T SPELL 'STRAWBERRY' (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Large language models sometimes fail at tasks like counting letters
due to their tokenization methods. This highlights limitations in LLM
architecture that affect their understanding of text. Nevertheless,
advancements continue, such as OpenAI's Strawberry for improved
reasoning and Google DeepMind's AlphaGeometry 2 for formal math. 

 FIRST MLPERF BENCHMARKS FOR NVIDIA BLACKWELL, AMD, GOOGLE, UNTETHER
AI (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia's new Blackwell chip demonstrated top per GPU performance in
MLPerf's LLM Q&A benchmark, showcasing significant advancements with
its 4-bit floating-point precision. However, competitors like Untether
AI and AMD also showed promising results, particularly in energy
efficiency. Untether AI's speedAI240 chip, for instance, excelled in
the edge-closed category, highlighting diverse strengths across new AI
inference hardware.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DIFFUSION MODELS PERFORM SPECTRAL AUTO REGRESSION (27 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Diffusion models and auto regressive models are often thought to be
fundamentally different forms of methods. However, they may actually
be more similar than we thought where diffusion models are actually
taking auto regressive steps in the frequency domain. 

 ENHANCED ALZHEIMER'S DIAGNOSIS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study presents a multimodal classification model designed to
improve the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. 

 CAUSAL INFERENCE IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed an advanced machine learning method for
identifying both direct and indirect causal variables of a target
within a system.

 ML DTYPES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Bfloat16 and fp8 support for native numpy arrays. 

 TIME SERIES FORECASTING WITH VISION MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VisionTS is a new approach that leverages the similarities between
natural images and time series data to enhance forecasting by
reformulating time series forecasting as an image reconstruction task.
It uses a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-trained on ImageNet to
achieve impressive zero-shot performance. 

 IMPROVING AUDIO GENERATION WITH SEMANTIC AWARENESS (12 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 X-Codec is a new approach to enhancing the performance of audio
generation by LLMs.

 CAN AI SCALING CONTINUE THROUGH 2030? (62 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI training is growing at an unprecedented 4x per year, outpacing
mobile adoption and genome sequencing rates from past technological
expansions. Research indicates scaling AI training could feasibly
continue until 2030, constrained primarily by power availability and
chip manufacturing capacity. Training runs up to 2e29 FLOP may become
possible, marking substantial progress akin to the leap from GPT-2 to
GPT-4, provided hundreds of billions are invested. Data scarcity and
latency also pose challenges, but these may be surmountable through
multimodal and synthetic data generation strategies and advanced
network topologies. 

 MEET BOARDWALK ROBOTICS' ADDITION TO HUMANOID ROBOTS (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Boardwalk Robotics has unveiled Alex, a humanoid upper torso robot
designed for tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and maintenance.
Developed independently while leveraging the pedigree of IHMC's
bipedal robot expertise, Alex is legless, with its creators
emphasizing manipulation over mobility to ensure safety and
efficiency. Commercial partners are currently being selected for
pilots, while researchers can purchase Alex immediately. 

 GPU UTILIZATION IS A MISLEADING METRIC (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 While commonly monitored, GPU utilization may not accurately reflect
true GPU performance in ML workloads, as it doesn't account for
whether the GPU's computational power is fully leveraged. Trainy
discovered this while only achieving ~20% model FLOPS utilization
(MFU) despite 100% GPU utilization during LLM training. It recommends
tracking SM efficiency for a better performance indicator and
achieving a 4x speedup in training time by optimizing with fused
kernels and the right model parallelism level.

 AI-IMPLANTED FALSE MEMORIES (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A study from MIT Media Lab found that generative chatbots powered by
large language models significantly increased the formation of false
memories during simulated crime witness interviews, inducing over
three times more immediate false memories than a control group.
