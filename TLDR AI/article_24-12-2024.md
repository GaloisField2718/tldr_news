HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 NEW PHYSICS SIM TRAINS ROBOTS 430,000 TIMES FASTER THAN REALITY (5
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Genesis, an open-source simulation platform, accelerates robot
training 430,000 times faster than real-world conditions using
text-generated 3D worlds. Developed by a team led by Carnegie Mellon
University, it processes physics calculations 80 times faster than
existing simulators using standard GPUs, facilitating rapid neural
network training for robotics. Genesis uses Python and offers an
accessible, non-proprietary solution for creating dynamic,
physics-based environments without manual programming effort. 

 WAYMO STILL DOING BETTER THAN HUMANS AT PREVENTING INJURIES AND
PROPERTY DAMAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Waymo's autonomous vehicles significantly outperform human drivers in
safety, showing an 88% reduction in property damage and a 92%
reduction in bodily injury claims according to a study that analyzed
25.3 million miles of driverless operation. Compared to new cars with
advanced safety tech, Waymo still achieves an 86% reduction in
property damage and 90% in bodily injury claims. The data supports the
potential of autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic fatalities, though
more extensive data is needed for comprehensive comparisons. 

 MICROSOFT'S GROWING AI HEALTH AMBITIONS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google DeepMind and OpenAI are intensifying their competition as
OpenAI shifts towards a more commercial focus. This rivalry is driving
both companies to innovate and push AI technology boundaries.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 4D DRIVING SIMULATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Stag-1 is a 4D driving simulation that reconstructs real-world scenes
and generates lifelike videos from any perspective. 

 APOLLO LARGE MULTIMODAL MODELS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta has released a number of multimodal video understanding models
with strong long context video performance. 

 TEXT CONDITIONED TEXTURE GENERATION WITH DIFFUSION (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Most texture generation systems rely on pretrained 2D images
diffusion models. This work tried to approach the problem directly in
UV texture space, which resulted in a set of inductive biases that
strongly improved the underlying results of the system.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE GOOGLE WILLOW THING (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Google's Quantum group's "Willow" is a 105-qubit superconducting chip
that showcases advancements in error correction and a new quantum
supremacy experiment. The chip demonstrates increased coherence times
and gate fidelity, marking a significant milestone in quantum
fault-tolerance. Despite its achievements, challenges remain in
reaching fully fault-tolerant quantum operations, and verification of
results continues to be complex. 

 INSIDE THE AI DRUG DISCOVERY ARMS RACE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI is rapidly transforming drug discovery, with biologics developers
securing $1.6B in 2024 funding, indicating an expanding focus beyond
small molecules. M&A activity in AI drug discovery is surging, with
major big pharma players acquiring startups and bolstering in-house AI
capabilities. This reflects a growing urgency to integrate AI in drug
R&D to reduce costs and accelerate development. 

 OPENAI EXPANDS CHATGPT CANVAS TO ALL USERS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI has made its digital editing space, Canvas, available to all
ChatGPT users, integrating it with GPT-4o. Canvas enhances the chat
interface by allowing real-time editing and running Python code
directly. It's now a default feature in custom GPTs, providing
advanced functionalities for users.
