HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TRANSFORM SOURCES INTO STRUCTURED DATA TABLES IN NOTEBOOKLM (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 NotebookLM has introduced Data Tables, a new feature that helps users
organize and analyze information from sources in a structured format.
The feature synthesizes sources into clean, structured tables ready to
export to Google Sheets. It is now rolling out to all users.
Screenshots of the feature are available in the article. 

 GOOGLE TESTS 30-MINUTE AUDIO LECTURES ON NOTEBOOKLM (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 NotebookLM is testing a new 'Lecture' format for Audio Overviews. The
feature will generate a comprehensive AI lecture of roughly 30
minutes. Lectures can be produced in different languages, depending on
the user settings. A sample lecture is available in the article.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CODEX VS. CLAUDE CODE (TODAY) (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There's no wrong choice when it comes to AI. The tool you choose
should match how you work. Try out both Claude and Codex and see which
one fits. Every AI tool has its strengths and weaknesses, and the only
way to discover what they are is by using them. 

 MEMORY: HOW AGENTS LEARN (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Agents can follow complex instructions, use tools, and work
autonomously for hours. However, ask them the same question twice, and
they have to start from scratch. We've made agents capable, but
haven't yet figured out how to make them learn. This article looks at
different types of memory and how they could be implemented into
agents.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 SPECULATIVE DECODING MODELS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SpecBundle Phase 1 is a set of production-ready EAGLE-3 checkpoints
trained with industry partners to improve real-world speculative
decoding. The release focused on instruct-tuned models and shipped
alongside SpecForge v0.2, which added major system refactors and
multi-backend support. 

 STIRRUP (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 Stirrup is a framework for building agents that lets models choose
their own approach to completing tasks. It has best practices and
tools built in and is fully customizable. Stirrup features a skills
system that extends agent capabilities, flexible tool execution,
context management tools, flexible provider support, and multimodal
support. 

 EXECUTORCH (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 ExecuTorch is a solution for deploying AI models on-device. Built by
PyTorch for privacy, performance, and portability, ExecuTorch powers
KPWA meta's on-device AI across Instagram, WhatsApp, Quest 3, Ray-Ban
Meta Smart Glasses, and more. It allows developers to deploy LLMs,
vision, speech, and other multimodal models with familiar PyTorch
APIs. The tool can accelerate research to production with seamless
model export, optimization, and deployment.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE WAU EFFECT (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenAI's use of Weekly Active Users (WAU) rather than Monthly Active
Users (MAU) renders its user base scale incomparable to other large
consumer technology products. ChatGPT's user retention is likely quite
low, meaning many users cycle in and out every month, inflating MAU
relative to WAU. Dividing MAU would reveal relatively weaker unit
economics that are directly comparable to other consumer technology
products. 

 TEST, DON'T (JUST) VERIFY (13 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AI is making formal verification go mainstream. Random testing will
play an important role in the future of software engineering. As
autoformalization tools get better, we will have many more formal
specifications. Random testing benefits from these formal
specifications in different ways than formal verification, but both
have their places.

power in a space equivalent to the space inside your skull. 

 WE FINALLY HAD A MOMENT TO RUN OUR SYSTEM WITH GPT-5.2 X-HIGH ON
ARC-AGI-2! (2 MINUTE READ) [15]

X-High on the full PUBLIC-EVAL dataset.
