FINE-TUNE CHATGPT (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates?utm_source=tldrai]


You can now fine-tune gpt-3.5-turbo on custom data. The resulting
model is yours and no data is used to train other models. This can
dramatically drive down costs, improve steerability, and improve
overall performance. GPT-4 fine-tuning is coming this fall.

MAKING OBJECT DETECTION BETTER FOR SMALL ITEMS (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09534v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

While current methods are great at detecting objects, they often have
problems spotting small items. CFINet is designed specifically for
these small object challenges. It uses a step-by-step approach to
first find good areas of interest and then focuses on mimicking
features to better recognize the small items. 

OPEN REPLICATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART VISION/LANGUAGE MODELS (28 MINUTE
READ) [https://huggingface.co/blog/idefics?utm_source=tldrai] 

HuggingFace has released IDEFICS, which is quite the acronym
(Image-aware Decoder Enhanced √† la Flamingo with Interleaved
Cross-attentionS). IDEFICS is essentially a replication of Flamingo,
which is a text and image model that interleaves the two and allows
for visual question answering and reasoning. It is built on Llama v1
and has 8B and 70B variants. 

IMPROVING 3D SCENE UNDERSTANDING (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://aibluefisher.github.io/DReg-NeRF/?utm_source=tldrai] 

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are a hot topic in computer
vision, combining multiple NeRFs together is still a challenge. To
tackle this, this team developed DReg-NeRF, a new method that pulls
out features from NeRF. It uses advanced techniques to understand how
different 3D scenes relate to each other without needing any human
input or special markers.

AI STARTUPS: SELL WORK, NOT SOFTWARE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software?utm_source=tldrai]


LLMs offer a paradigm shift for startups from selling software aimed
at user productivity to selling the actual work product itself.
Companies can capitalize on this by automating specialized tasks (like
creating a demand package for law firms) rather than just improving
productivity incrementally. This approach competes with outsourced
solutions, potentially offering more consistency and value, while
reallocating human capital to higher-value tasks.
