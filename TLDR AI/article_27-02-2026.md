 YOUR AI AGENT DEMO LOOKED GREAT. NOW SHIP IT. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The hard part of building AI agents isn't getting an LLM to respond
— it's getting it to respond _correctly_, from _your_ data, in
production.

That's a retrieval problem. And retrieval is what Algolia [4] has been
doing for 1.75 trillion searches a year. Their new Agent Studio gives
developers a sandbox to build AI agents with built-in RAG and MCP
support, connect any LLM, define permissions, and test everything
before it goes live.

This ebook [4] walks through the technical architecture, use cases in
ecommerce, SaaS, and enterprise, and how to go from first agent to
production in days rather than months.

 NANO BANANA 2 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google's Nano Banana 2 (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) combines the advanced
reasoning and image quality of Nano Banana Pro with significantly
faster generation speeds. 

 STATEMENT FROM DARIO AMODEI ON OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
WAR (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic believes in the importance of using AI to defend the US and
other democracies and to defeat its autocratic adversaries. This is
why it has worked proactively to deploy its models to the Department
of War and the intelligence community. However, it also acknowledges
that, in some cases, AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic
values. Two such use cases are mass domestic surveillance and full
autonomous weapons. Anthropic has refused to accede to the Department
of War's request to remove safeguards in its models. It will help the
Department transition to another provider to avoid any disruption to
ongoing military planning should it decide to offboard Anthropic. 

 XAI CO-FOUNDER TOBY POHLEN IS LATEST EXECUTIVE TO DEPART (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 xAI co-founder Toby Pohlen is leaving the startup. Pohlen was in
charge of Macrohard, a division of the company focused on AI software
run by agents. He is the seventh of 12 xAI co-founders to leave in
less than three years. xAI merged with SpaceX earlier this month.
SpaceX plans to go public in what is expected to be the largest
initial public offering of all time.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HYPERSCALER CAPEX HAS QUADRUPLED SINCE GPT-4'S RELEASE, NEARING HALF
A TRILLION DOLLARS IN 2025 (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hyperscaler capital expenditures have grown 70% per year since the
release of GPT-4. Company statements and analyst projections
anticipate continued rapid spending growth in capital expenditures in
2026. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle are predicted to
spend a collective $770 billion on capex this year. There was nearly
half a trillion dollars invested in AI in total last year. 

 NEXT-TOKEN PREDICTOR IS AN AI'S JOB, NOT ITS SPECIES (14 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Overemphasizing next-token prediction is a confusion of levels. On
the levels where AI is a next-token predictor, humans are also
next-token predictors. On the levels where humans are not next-token
predictors, AI isn't one either. While AI was shaped by next-token
prediction, the inside of its thoughts probably looks like a
world-model, the same as a human's. 

 BUILDING INTERACTIVE WORLDS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Real‑time interactive environments require tight integration
between simulation engines, agent AI, and live user input to create
dynamic, persistent worlds. State management, sensory abstraction,
behavior logic, and rendering pipelines must work in concert to
support scalable multi‑user interaction. Predictable agent behavior
and efficient event propagation are core requirements for responsive,
interactive experiences.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 LLMS DON'T SHIP BAD CODE. TEAMS DO (SPONSOR) [11] 

 When AI codes, who's accountable for quality? Today, AI assistants
generate Playwright tests, AI healers patch broken selectors, and
everything stays green, even when tests don't preserve business
intent. mabl [11] calls this “logic drift,” and it gets worse with
scale. Read the full breakdown on mabl's blog [11] 

 REALTIME PROMPTING GUIDE (38 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI announced the general availability of the Realtime API
alongside gpt-realtime, a speech-to-speech model with improved
instruction following, tool use, voice quality, and lower latency. The
accompanying prompting guide outlines a practical prompt structure and
techniques tailored specifically for realtime voice systems. 

 INTRODUCING HELM (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 helm is a TypeScript framework for AI agents. It allows agents to
call typed functions with structured inputs and outputs. helm ships
with built-in skills for everyday actions, and users can define custom
skills. Its 'execute' tool runs whatever JavaScript the LLM writes
within a sandbox. 

 DUALPATH FOR HIGH-THROUGHPUT AGENTIC LLM INFERENCE (18 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 DualPath introduces a dual-path KV-cache loading strategy that
enables both storage-to-prefill and storage-to-decode transfers,
alleviating I/O bottlenecks in disaggregated inference systems.

 PERPLEXITY APIS POWER ANDROID OEM AI FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Perplexity is supplying its AI APIs to a major Android device maker
to enhance on‑device and cloud‑connected features. The integration
brings Perplexity's deep research, summarization, and knowledge
retrieval capabilities directly into the handset ecosystem at scale.
This move accelerates manufacturer differentiation and broadens
Perplexity's footprint in consumer‑facing AI experiences. 

 ON-DEVICE FUNCTION CALLING IN GOOGLE AI EDGE GALLERY (7 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Google's on-device AI showcase app, Google AI Edge Gallery, is now
available on iOS in addition to Android. It includes two
out-of-the-box agentic experiences, Mobile Actions and Tiny Garden,
which showcase how Google's efficient FunctionGemma model translates
natural language directly into function calls on devices within merely
270M parameters. Benchmarking has now been integrated directly into
the Google AI Edge Gallery app, so users can measure and experience
LiteRT's leading CPU and GPU performance across their devices.

 HOW TO VIBE CODE AGENTIC NETWORKS YOU CAN ACTUALLY DEPLOY (SPONSOR)
[17] 

 Cognizant's AI Lab explains how to quickly prototype, test, and
ground multi-agent systems at scale using neuro-san, an open-source
framework for agentifying your enterprise. Read the article [18] 

 VIBE CODING AND THE MAKER MOVEMENT (13 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Vibe coding differs from previous tech movements by skipping the
experimental "scenius" phase, leading to rapid, judgment-free outputs
and an evaluative disconnect. 

 HOW AI IS REVOLUTIONIZING HIRING IN COMPETITIVE TALENT MARKETS (5
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 AI transforms hiring by efficiently screening candidates and
predicting long-term success, improving both speed and accuracy in
recruitment. 

 AI WELFARE AS A DEMOTIVATOR FOR TAKEOVER (5 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Superhuman AI might be deterred from takeover by being incentivized
to avoid risk, considering factors like the probability of getting
caught, the desirability of a non-takeover state, and its risk
tolerance.
