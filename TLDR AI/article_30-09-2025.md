 HOW TO USE CONTEXTUAL AI TO SURFACE RELEVANT INFORMATION,
MID-CONVERSATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Employees switch between apps +1,200 TIMES PER DAY, killing
productivity. This "toggle tax" is avoidable: AI + integrations can
give users the information they need, without rummaging through 37
open tabs.

On October 9 [4], technical experts from GLEAN AND ZOOM will
demonstrate how contextual AI can surface relevant answers—both from
your enterprise data and from the web—directly inside your Zoom
conversations (or wherever employees communicate).

The session covers real scenarios for Sales, Support, and Engineering
teams, and how the integration keeps sensitive data private while
making discovery effortless. You'll also get a rollout playbook [4]
for driving adoption and measuring ROI.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anthropic's latest model boasts the highest score on the SWE-bench
Verified (77.2%), alongside major improvements in computer use,
reasoning, and math. The release includes major product updates:
checkpoints in Claude Code for instant rollback, the Claude for Chrome
extension for Max users, and the Claude Agent SDK that makes the
infrastructure powering Claude Code available to all developers. 

 BUY IN CHATGPT WITH INSTANT CHECKOUT (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT now supports direct purchases from Etsy sellers via Instant
Checkout, with Shopify coming soon. The system runs on the open
Agentic Commerce Protocol, co-developed with Stripe, and is open for
merchant integrations. 

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES CLAUDE AGENT SDK FOR BUILDING VERSATILE AI AGENTS
(11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic introduced the Claude Agent SDK, expanding its capabilities
beyond coding to enable building versatile agents for tasks such as
finance management and customer support. This SDK equips agents with
tools for context gathering, executing tasks, and iterating based on
feedback, optimizing workflows through features like bash scripting
and subagents. Developers can leverage the SDK for immediate
integration and enhanced agent functionality.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW GPU MATMUL KERNELS WORK (96 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The architecture, assembly, and kernel design techniques behind
high-performance matrix multiplication on NVIDIA GPUs. 

 A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR THE ECONOMICS OF TRANSFORMATIVE AI (32 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 There are nine "Grand Challenges" for studying the economic effects
of AI, spanning issues from income distribution to AI safety to human
meaning. Economists need to start researching these issues now due to
the speed of AI progress and the unprecedented resource flow towards
the AI industry. By the time transformative AI, which they define as
driving 3x productivity growth, arrives, it will be too late for
economists to aid in the upheaval. 

 BUILDING AI FOR CYBER DEFENDERS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI models are now useful for cybersecurity tasks in practice, not
just theory. Anthropic has caught hackers using their tools and
invested in making Claude Sonnet 4.5 useful for defenders looking to
detect, analyze, and remediate vulnerabilities in code and deployed
systems. Now, the defenders need to adopt and experiment with AI to
keep pace.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 THE SANS BLUEPRINT FOR SECURE AI (SPONSOR) [11] 

 The SANS Secure AI Blueprint provides a proven model for reducing
risk and owning AI securely. Structured around three imperatives —
PROTECT AI, UTILIZE AI, GOVERN AI — it helps SOCs, CISOs, and
engineers defend GenAI in real-world deployments. Get the blueprint
[11] or explore additional AI security resources from SANS. [12] 

 AGENTIC COMMERCE (WEBSITE) [13] 

 This site features design flows for embedded commerce in ChatGPT.
OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol is an open standard that enables
purchases. It enables agents to reason over structured state, invoke
tools at each step, and keep customers informed in real time. This
page will help developers start with the essentials, deepen their
understanding, and prepare for production with focused ACP resources. 

 DEEPSEEK-V3.2-EXP: SPARSE ATTENTION MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp has introduced a sparse attention mechanism aimed
at improving training and inference efficiency on long-context
sequences. 

 LORA WITHOUT REGRET - THINKING MACHINES LAB (27 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LoRA, the most popular method for fine-tuning AI models, can match
the performance of expensive full fine-tuning when applied correctly,
delivering the same results at two-thirds the cost. The key is
applying LoRA to all network layers (especially MLPs rather than just
attention layers) and ensuring the rank is high enough for the
dataset. Thinking Machines found ranks of 256-512 work well for
typical post-training scenarios combined with 10× higher learning
rates than fine-tuning.

 OPENAI'S NEW SORA VIDEO GENERATOR TO REQUIRE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO OPT
OUT (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI's new Sora video generator can create videos that feature
copyright material unless copyright holders opt out of having their
work appear. The company began alerting talent agencies and studios
about the product and its opt-out process over the past week. The
model will be released in the coming days. It won't generate images of
recognizable public figures without their permission. 

 HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 IS ABLE TO WORK FOR 30
HOURS TO BUILD AN APP LIKE SLACK?! (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Claude Sonnet 4.5's system prompt reveals how it is able to work for
30 hours. This post goes into detail about how it works. A copy of the
system prompt is available in the thread.
