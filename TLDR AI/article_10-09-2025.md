 HOW SNOWFLAKE IS ADAPTING USAGE-BASED PRICING TO THE AI ERA (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Snowflake's usage-based pricing has been one key driver of its market
leadership. In this webinar [4], you'll get an insider view of how the
team managed its pricing and billing, and how they're preparing for
the Al era of monetization.

Join Ryan Campbell, Director of Product Finance at Snowflake, and
Scott Woody, Metronome CEO, to learn how Snowflake aligns finance,
product, GTM, and engineering around pricing decisions. On the agenda:

 	* Reducing friction and accelerating pricing decisions
 	* Applying rigor and experimentation to your monetization model
 	* ﻿﻿Lessons from Snowflake [4] on designing pricing for
predictability, visibility, and control

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE CAN NOW CREATE AND EDIT FILES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Claude can now generate and edit documents, spreadsheets, slides, and
PDFs directly in the app, allowing users to turn prompts and data into
downloadable files. 

 MICROSOFT TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON OPENAI BY BUYING AI FROM RIVAL
ANTHROPIC (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude will be integrated into Office 365 apps, ending Microsoft's
exclusive reliance on OpenAI. OpenAI has continued to put strain on
its relationship with Microsoft by announcing competitive products,
including an AI-powered LinkedIn rival and custom chips built by
Broadcom. 

 NVIDIA UNVEILS NEW GPU DESIGNED FOR LONG-CONTEXT INFERENCE (1 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Nvidia has announced a new GPU called the Rubin CPX designed for
context windows larger than 1 million tokens. The GPU, meant to be
used as part of a broader 'disaggregated inference' infrastructure
approach, is optimized for the processing of large sequences of
context. It performs better on long-context tasks like video
generation and software development. The Rubin CPX will be available
at the end of 2026.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE WHOLE POINT OF OPENAI'S RESPONSES API IS TO HELP THEM HIDE
REASONING TRACES (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI's Responses API replaces the previous /chat/completions API
for inference. The new API has a lot more features, but the main
difference is that it is stateful. Users no longer have to pass the
entire conversation history with each request, they just have to pass
an ID representing the state of the conversation and the provider
keeps models up to date. This allows OpenAI to keep its reasoning
traces secret. 

 THE TRAINING IMPERATIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Every serious AI company will eventually train its own models. The
barrier to doing so is collapsing. Distillation, fine-tuning, and
post-containing get easier every month. Soon, the only way to stay
relevant will be to own your own models. 

 THOUGHTS ON EVALS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Production monitoring reveals real issues that pre-deployment evals
will inevitably miss, especially as AI products become more
unpredictable and personalized. Evals are collections of already-known
failure cases, but agents can and often do fail in ways that produce
no error codes.

 BYTEDANCE'S BACKWARD REASONING (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ByteDance's REER (REverse-Engineered Reasoning) is a paradigm that
derives step-by-step reasoning from known good answers rather than
building it forward via RL or imitation. 

 INTRODUCING THE MCP REGISTRY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Model Context Protocol Registry provides a standardized way to
distribute and discover MCP servers. A community-driven project, it
allows organizations to create private enterprise registries while
maintaining compatibility through shared API schemas and moderation
guidelines.

 GEMINI ROLLS OUT ‘TOOLS' REDESIGN ON WEB AS NANO BANANA GROWTH
CONTINUES (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Gemini Web has rolled out its Tools redesign. The prompt bar is now
centered with a new 'Tools' menu that lets users access Deep Research,
Veo, image creation, Canvas, Guided Learning, and Deep Think. Gemini
now groups suggested prompts together for a cleaner look. Screenshots
of the new interface are available in the article. 

 THE GROSS MARGIN DEBATE IN AI (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI companies face varied gross margins across sectors. Chips maintain
around 70% margins, while cloud services see margins pressured by AI
investments, estimated between 50-55%. Application-level margins range
widely, with AI "Supernovas" starting at 25%, potentially negative,
while others hit 60%, highlighting pricing strategies and diversified
revenue models to improve margins over time.
