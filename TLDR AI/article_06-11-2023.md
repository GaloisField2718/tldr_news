HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ELON MUSK'S XAI BEATS CHATGPT ON LLM BENCHMARKS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 xAI trained an autoregressive language model at 34B params. It is
quite performant and will power an AI system built into the X
platform. 

 WHAT TO EXPECT AT OPENAI DEV DAY (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI Dev Day is today and it is rumored that we can expect
enhancements to OpenAI‚Äôs developer tools, new pricing plans for
ChatGPT, and a peek at Gizmo V8, a new and improved version of the
ChatGPT iOS app. 

 EXPANDING VRP FOR ENHANCED GENERATIVE AI SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [7]


 Google is extending its Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) to
include generative AI, encouraging research into AI safety and
security. Simultaneously, it's expanding its open-source work to
ensure better AI supply chain safety. It is also leveraging the Secure
AI Framework (SAIF) and the Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST)
to protect AI supply chains from threats like model tampering and data
poisoning.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 HIGHLIGHTS FROM NEURIPS 2023 (45 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Paper digest generated summaries of many papers from NeurIPS 2023.
Interestingly, much of this work is almost a year old at this point
and has already been readily adopted by the community. 

 HELIXNET IS 3 MODELS COMBINED INTO ONE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 If you fine-tune three task-specific models from the Mistral base,
one for generation, one for critique, and a final one for regeneration
then the entire system shows dramatically improved generation
performance. Synthetic data is used to tune these models. 

 SKETCH WHAT YOU WANT YOUR ROBOT TO DO (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sketching a rough outline of what you want a robot to accomplish is a
novel form of communication and turns out to work surprisingly well
for standard pick and place tasks.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 GISKARD: OPEN-SOURCE TESTING FRAMEWORK FOR LLMS & ML MODELS (GITHUB
REPO SPONSOR) [11] 

 Giskard is a Python library [11] that automatically¬†detects
vulnerabilities¬†of AI models, from tabular models to LLM, including:
performance biases, data leakage, spurious correlation, hallucination,
toxicity, security issues and many more. Get your model to production
quickly and safely.
Install Giskard (via GitHub) [11] or try it in Colab [11]

 DEEPSPEED RELEASES INFERENCE SOFTWARE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This is Deepspeed's new software for competing with vLLM and
text-generation interfaces for the fast serving of language models. It
comes with many state-of-the-art acceleration features and preliminary
results suggest it's up to 2.4x faster. 

 X "SIMILAR POSTS" POWERED BY RUST-BASED VECTOR DATABASE (GITHUB REPO)
[13] 

 Qdrant uses a lightning-fast vector database to store embeddings. 

 VIDEO2MUSIC CREATES TAILORED MUSIC FOR VIDEOS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Video2Music‚Äôs AI framework generates emotionally congruent music
for videos, leveraging a unique dataset and transformer model
validated by user studies.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI DATA PIPELINE ATTACKS (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Poisoning the data well and other data pipeline attacks are a huge
challenge for the cyber security community and often a blindspot for
most AI organizations. This post outlines (with code) what the attacks
are to help with future mitigation. 

 COULD CRUISE BE THE THERANOS OF AI? (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cruise, GM's driverless car company, frequently relies on remote
operators for its vehicles, challenging the company's claims of
autonomy. The revelation raises concerns about the true capabilities
of self-driving cars and prompts calls for transparency and
investigation into the safety and autonomy of such vehicles. 

 EXTENSIONS PROMPT INJECTION AND DATA EXFILTRATION (12 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 A great deep dive into some novel vulnerabilities that come from
generative AI plugins. In this case, the attack resembles SQL
injection but came via an infected Google Doc. While Google has fixed
the issue, the security researcher was able to exfiltrate other
users‚Äô prompts.
