 OPENAI'S HEAD OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING SHARES HER MONETIZATION
STRATEGY FOR HYPERGROWTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ChatGPT is only one part of OpenAI's success. The other part is the
breathtaking speed with which OpenAI built a new monetization model
[4].

In a fireside chat at Monetize 2025, OpenAI's Head of Financial
Engineering, Sara Conlon, explained how she built an engineering
billing org poised for hypergrowth [4].

Read the blog to learn:

 	* Why centralizated monetization infrastructure is essential
 	* Hard lessons from scaling fast, including outages and high-stakes
incidents
 	* How OpenAI structures its billing team
 	* Preparing for the future: hybrid models, iteration velocity, and
systems built for coexistence

 EARLY LOOK AT IMAGES GENERATED BY NANO BANANA 2 (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nano Banana 2 is expected to launch on November 11.  The model will
have 2K native output and huge improvements across many areas. This
article provides some examples of outputs from the new model along
with comparisons with outputs from Nano Banana 1. 

 YOU CAN NOW GET MORE CODEX USAGE FROM YOUR PLAN AND CREDITS (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 GPT-5-Codex-Mini, a more compact and cost-efficient version of
GPT-5-Codex that allows roughly 4x more usage at a slight capability
tradeoff, is now available in OpenAI's CLI and IDE extension. OpenAI
has increased rate limits by 50% for ChatGPT Plus, Business, and Edu
users. There is now priority processing for ChatGPT Pro and Enterprise
customers.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPENAI'S $1 TRILLION INFRASTRUCTURE SPEND (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has committed to spending $1.15 trillion on hardware and cloud
infrastructure between 2025 and 2035. The estimated annual spending
and commitments convey an absolutely enormous level of potential and
ambition. OpenAI will need to grow from around $10 billion in 2024
revenue to $577 billion by 2029. This article takes a look at the
numbers. 

 THE STATE OF AI IN 2025: AGENTS, INNOVATION, AND TRANSFORMATION (21
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Most organizations are still in the experimentation or piloting
phase. High performers use AI to drive growth, innovation, and cost.
Redesigning workflows is a key success factor. The potential impact of
AI on employment is still debated - 43% of workers in a survey
expected no change in the overall size of the workforce in their
organizations in the coming year.

 IT complexity can drive costs up across your company. Intelligent IT
automation is key to taming technology chaos. Get the insights you

 INTRODUCING NESTED LEARNING: A NEW ML PARADIGM FOR CONTINUAL LEARNING
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Continual learning, the ability to acquire new knowledge without
forgetting old information, remains a major obstacle to AGI since
current models suffer from “catastrophic forgetting,” where
learning new tasks diminishes proficiency on previous ones. A
proof-of-concept architecture called Hope, a self-modifying model that
optimizes its own memory, outperformed modern recurrent models and
transformers on language modeling and excelled particularly at
long-context needle-in-a-haystack tasks. 

 QUANTIZATION IS NOT A COMPROMISE — IT'S THE NEXT PARADIGM (3 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 K2-Thinking's release has led many developers to be curious about its
native INT4 quantization format. INT4 accelerates RL training due to
its low-latency profile. Quantization is no longer a tradeoff. Native
low-bit quantization will become a standard paradigm for large model
training with the evolution of param-scaling and test-time-scaling. 

 CLAUDE CODE INFRASTRUCTURE SHOWCASE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository contains a curated reference library of
production-tested Claude Code infrastructure. It contains
production-tested infrastructure for auto-activating skills via locks,
specialized agents for complex tasks, and more. Using this
infrastructure, skills will suggest themselves based on context, hooks
will trigger skills at the right time, modular skills stay under
context limits, dev docs preserve knowledge across resets, and agents
will streamline complex tasks.

 DEBT HAS ENTERED THE AI BOOM (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Companies are pouring billions of dollars into cutting-edge computing
facilities. The sheer scale of spending is causing investors to be
concerned. Tech giants are turning to financing maneuvers that may add
to the risk. Hyperscalers are leveraging a growing list of complex
debt-financing options, including corporate set, securitization
markets, private financing, and off-balance-sheet vehicles. 

 OPENAI: AI PROGRESS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The gap between everyday use of AI and its core capabilities is
massive. Chatbots are used to write emails or replace web searches,
while the underlying models outperform human experts in math and
coding competitions. OpenAI is advocating for light regulation now to
cement its market position before the next leap in capability. Once
systems become transformative enough to warrant a coordinated national
response, there will be a shift to federal oversight that overrides
state-level restrictions.
