 AIRIA: ENTERPRISE AI ORCHESTRATION THAT UNIFIES EXPERIMENTATION,
PROD, AND GOVERNANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You want AI to be more than a never-ending work in progress, and that
means enabling no-code, low-code, and pro-code development without IT
gatekeepers standing in the way. Yet that doesn't mean governance goes
out the window.

Airia is the enterprise AI platform [4] built to drive AI adoption by
unifying innovation and security. Teams at Stryker, BuzzFeed, and
ArcelorMittal use it to:

 	* Test prompts, LLMs, and agent variants in safe, prod-like
environments 
 	* End AI anxiety by controlling agent sprawl and implementing
automatic guardrails [5]
 	* Discover risks, orchestrate agents, and monitor threats in one
place

Get a demo [5] and make AI adoption a reality

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 WE'RE TURNING TODOS INTO TASKS IN CLAUDE CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has upgraded Todos in Claude Code to Tasks, a new primitive
that helps Claude Code track and complete more complicated projects
and collaborate on them across multiple sessions or subagents. Claude
can create Tasks with dependencies on each other that are stored in
the metadata, mirroring how projects work. Tasks are stored in the
file system so that multiple subagents or sessions can collaborate on
them. Updates are broadcasted to all sessions currently working on the
same Task List when one session updates a Task. 

 PERSONALIZED SEARCH WITH AI MODE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google is expanding "Personal Intelligence" in Search, enabling AI
Mode to use private context from Gmail and Photos for more
personalized results.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 PANTERA BLOCKCHAIN LETTER :: JANUARY 2026 (25 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Macro, positioning, flows, and market structure effects were the
dominant drivers last year, particularly for assets outside of
Bitcoin. It was a difficult year for much of the token market, but the
year also saw advanced institutional adoption, clarified
product-market fit, and compressed valuations across large segments of
the ecosystem. A strong fundamental backdrop following a year-long
bear market for the broader token universe could present an
opportunity. Forward-looking setups appear increasingly asymmetric,
provided fundamentals stabilize and breadth returns. 

 OVERCOMING COMPUTE AND MEMORY BOTTLENECKS WITH FLASHATTENTION-4 ON
NVIDIA BLACKWELL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FlashAttention is an input/output aware algorithm that computes the
same mathematical result as standard attention, but more efficiently.
It uses reduced memory access and near-linear memory to achieve this.
These optimizations lead to faster training and inference and enable
models to handle longer sequences of tokens. FlashAttention-4, the
latest iteration of optimized CUDA kernels, achieves a peak
performance of 1,605 TFLOPS/s. 

 BUILDING DEEP AGENT FRONTENDS (38 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CopilotKit published a tutorial on building a fullstack Deep Agent
app that includes resume ingestion, skill extraction, sub-agents with
web search, and a streaming UI.

published BEAUTIFUL sites without dev resources. Now pre-seed and
seed-stage startups get their first year free. Make your website the
easy part of your startup and claim your free year [11] 

 QWEN3-TTS FAMILY IS NOW OPEN SOURCED: VOICE DESIGN, CLONE, AND
GENERATION! (35 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Qwen3-TTS is a series of speech generation models that supports voice
cloning, voice design, ultra-high-quality human-like speech
generation, and natural language-based voice control. The models
support 10 mainstream languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean,
German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian) along with
various dialects. They exhibit strong contextual understanding,
allowing them to adapt tone, rhythm, and emotional expression based on
instructions and text semantics. 

 SMALL MODELS, BIG RESULTS: ACHIEVING SUPERIOR INTENT EXTRACTION
THROUGH DECOMPOSITION (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 For agents to be truly helpful, the underlying models need to be able
to understand what users are trying to do when they are interacting
with them. Large multimodal LLMs are already good at understanding
user intent, but this typically involves sending information to a
server, which can be slow, costly, and carries the potential risk of
exposing sensitive information. The task can be made more tractable
for small models by separating user intent understanding into two
stages. 

 D4RT: UNIFIED, FAST 4D SCENE RECONSTRUCTION & TRACKING (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 D4RT is a unified AI model for efficient 4D scene reconstruction and
tracking that achieves up to 300x efficiency over traditional methods.
Utilizing a unified encoder-decoder Transformer architecture, D4RT
processes scenes dynamically by answering targeted queries about 3D
space and time from 2D video inputs. This speed and scalability suit
applications in robotics and augmented reality. 

 ROBOTICS VIDEO BENCHMARK AND DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 RBench is a benchmark for robotics video generation, and RoVid-X is a
million-scale dataset for training embodied video models. 

 RENDER-OF-THOUGHT: VISUALIZING REASONING CHAINS (18 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Render-of-Thought (RoT) converts reasoning steps into visual
representations using VLMs, offering a more compact and analyzable
alternative to Chain-of-Thought prompting. The method achieves better
token compression and faster inference while maintaining competitive
reasoning performance.

 SALESFORCE ADOPTS CURSOR AT SCALE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Over 90% of Salesforce's 20,000 engineers now use Cursor in daily
workflows, improving development speed and code quality. The shift has
helped power product releases like Agentforce and signals broader
industry trends in AI-assisted software engineering. 

 THOUGHTS ON EVALS (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Raindrop's AI monitors agents by generating billions of labels
monthly, detecting issues, and providing performance insights in the
real world. Unlike Eval Driven Development, Raindrop focuses on
monitoring after deployment, allowing real-world feedback and faster
iteration. Monitoring tools are more effective for AI products due to
their dynamic nature, offering comprehensive real-world performance
insights that static evals can't match.
