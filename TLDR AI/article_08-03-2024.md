HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 INFLECTION 2.5 (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Inflection has launched a new model to power its personal assistant,
Pi. The model performs within 94% of GPT-4 with impressive reasoning
scores on benchmarks. Inflection claims it only took 40% of the
compute to train relative to GPT-4. An interesting insight from this
post is that the average conversation with Pi lasts 33 minutes. 

 ANSWER AI‚ÄôS NEW OPEN SOURCE FINE-TUNING TOOL (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Answer AI has released a new FSDP/QLoRA training tool that makes it
possible to train 70B parameter models on consumer GPUs. It has open
sourced the code and made it easy to run locally or on runpod. 

 COHERE X ACCENTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cohere and Accenture are collaborating to bring cohere embedding
technology to more than 9,000 enterprise clients.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 TINYBENCHMARKS: EVALUATING LLMS WITH FEWER EXAMPLES (26 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Evaluating language models is typically done with hand-curated
benchmarks. Some of these benchmarks are quite large, with some at
over 14k examples, which leads to high expense and noise in
evaluation. This work shows that you can reliably evaluate language
model performance with as few as 100 examples from popular benchmarks.


 DEEP DIVE: TRAINING MODELS AT SCALE (45 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A great tutorial on the different types of parallelism for training
large models at scale. 

 TEACHING ROBOTS TO IMITATE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DP3 introduces a cutting-edge approach to imitation learning,
combining 3D visual data and diffusion policies to teach robots
complex skills efficiently.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SCALE AUTOMATED WEB TESTING WITHOUT SCALING HEADCOUNT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 You don‚Äôt need an army of testers to build, run, and maintain more
tests. QA Wolf (4.8 ‚≠ê on G2) [11] brings AI-level scale and
efficiency to testing, with unlimited parallel test runs on their
cloud infrastructure and a zero-flake guarantee.
80% automated test coverage [11] in just 4 months. Trusted by Cohere,
Autotrader, Salesloft and many others.

 NOUS RESEARCH GENSTRUCT MODEL (HUGGINGFACE HUB) [12] 

 Genstruct is a model that can be used to generate instructions from
natural language text. This can then be used to train downstream
models for specific useful tasks. 

 FRUCTOSE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Fructose is a Python package for creating dependable strongly-typed
interfaces around LLM calls. 

 ENHANCING LLM PERFORMANCE THROUGH COLLABORATION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A novel method enables large language models to work together by
taking turns generating text, token by token. This strategy allows
models to leverage their unique strengths and expertise for various
tasks, leading to improved performance across instruction-following,
domain-specific questions, and reasoning challenges.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BENCHMARKING MULTIHEADED ATTENTION IMPLEMENTATIONS (JUPYTER NOTEBOOK)
[15] 

 There is an almost 10x difference in speed between different
implementations of the popular multi-headed attention module used in
modern LLMs. This notebook shows a few and benchmarks their
performance. 

 AI IS LIKE WATER: NECESSARY, UBIQUITOUS, AND SO SIMILAR (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Technology alone is no longer enough to provide a competitive
advantage for GenAI companies. This makes GenAI and bottled water
similar, as the underlying product is essentially the same. The key
differentiators must come from factors such as user experience,
distribution, perceived value to customers, branding, and marketing. 

 SORA, GROQ, AND VIRTUAL REALITY (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A few years ago, the concept of the metaverse seemed like it was just
fiction from Ernest Cline's book, and Facebook's metaverse push seemed
ill-fated. Today, things feel different. Sora generates complex video
scenarios and Groq's deterministic chips reduce machine-learning
algorithms for faster processing. Together, the convergence of these
advancements pushes us closer to achieving real-time video simulation
and true virtual reality.

 MICROSOFT INTRODUCES COPILOT AI CHATBOT FOR FINANCE WORKERS IN EXCEL
AND OUTLOOK (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Microsoft has unveiled a new Copilot chatbot tailored for finance
tasks, with a public preview to come before pricing details are
announced. The AI can conduct variance analysis, reconcile data in
Excel, and expedite Outlook collections, integrating with SAP and
Dynamics 365. The tool aims to reduce time spent on manual tasks for
finance teams, potentially transforming financial planning and
analysis efficiency. 

 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS MISTRAL DEAL BEEFS UP AZURE WITHOUT SPURNING OPENAI (3
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft's ‚Ç¨15 million investment in French AI firm Mistral while
continuing its strong partnership with OpenAI illustrates its strategy
to diversify and bolster Azure's AI offerings and gain a foothold in
the European market ahead of the EU's AI Act. Azure aims to become a
model garden, offering a variety of AI models to attract developers
and compete with other cloud services. The Mistral deal also positions
Microsoft strategically within European AI regulatory frameworks. 

 US REGULATORS INVESTIGATE WHETHER OPENAI INVESTORS WERE MISLED, SAY
REPORTS (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The SEC is investigating OpenAI, focusing on CEO Sam Altman's
internal communications after accusations that he misled investors.
This inquiry coincides with global attention on OpenAI's ChatGPT and
scrutinizes the competitive impact of AI investments by OpenAI and
tech giants in the sector.
