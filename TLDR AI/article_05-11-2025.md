 [RESEARCH] CONNECTING MONITORING AND AI TO BUSINESS OUTCOMES
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In The State of Observability 2025 report by Dynatrace, research
findings show that 98% of ITOps leaders use AI for security
compliance, but only 28% align observability data to business KPIs.

As enterprises scale AI, observability is shifting from reactive
monitoring to a strategic intelligence layer.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC PROJECTS $70B IN REVENUE BY 2028 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The company projects API revenue of $3.8 billion this year, double
OpenAI, and is targeting $20-26 billion in annual recurring revenue
for 2026. OpenAI is aiming for $100 billion in revenue by 2027, but
expects to lose $115 billion before reaching profitability in 2029,
compared to Anthropic, which is projected to be cash flow positive by
2028. 

 GOOGLE IS PREPARING NANO BANANA 2 FOR THE UPCOMING RELEASE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google's upcoming GEMPIX2 model (Nano Banana 2) could be available as
soon as next week. It is expected to be targeted at creators and
professionals who rely on Gemini for image generation and AI-assisted
creative workflows. The Nano Banana line has attracted considerable
interest and contributed to a noticeable growth in Gemini's user base.


 OPENAI'S SORA VIDEO GENERATOR APP FINALLY AVAILABLE ON ANDROID (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sora is now available on Android, making hyperrealistic video
generation capabilities available to millions more users. The app
quickly became a social media phenomenon when it was first released on
iOS. It allows users to create realistic videos with audio and
impressive physics. Android users will still need an invite code to
actively use Sora's generation features. The launch is limited to
select countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, and Vietnam.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CHAINING FFMPEG WITH A BROWSER AGENT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 100x included ffmpeg into its Chrome extension to make complex media
processing a single, serverless, and stateless step in any workflow.
It already had a browser agent for automation - ffmpeg became another
'tool call' for the agent. This enabled the agent to deal with complex
editing tasks like mixing audio and video and adding text over video.
This post gives readers a look at how the integration works. 

 BEYOND STANDARD LLMS (46 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The largest and most capable open-weight large language models today
are autoregressive decoder-style transformers. Some alternatives have
popped up in recent years. While some are geared toward better
efficiency, others are aimed at improving model performance. This
article gives an overview of alternative models that exist, from text
diffusion models to the most recent linear attention hybrid
architectures. 

 HOW WE BUILT A CUSTOM VISION LLM TO IMPROVE DOCUMENT PROCESSING AT
GRAB (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Grab developed a lightweight, specialized Vision LLM from the ground
up to address the limitations of traditional Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) systems. Traditional OCR systems struggle with the
variety of document templates they have to process and often fall
short in understanding South East Asian languages. Grab's model can
effectively replace traditional OCR pipelines, opening new
possibilities for document processing at scale. This post details how
the company built its new model and also provides performance results.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 AI AGENTS ARE EVERYWHERE, BUT ARE THEY DELIVERING? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 AI agents are rapidly becoming business-critical, but enterprise
success is far from guaranteed. In fact, a new DATAIKU/HARRIS POLL
SURVEY [11] of 800+ global data leaders found that 95% admit they
cannot fully trace AI decisions for audit purposes. 

The “GLOBAL AI CONFESSIONS REPORT: DATA LEADERS EDITION [11]”
uncovers the hidden risks, misalignments, and urgent corrections
leaders need to turn agents from a liability into measurable business
value. Discover the hidden risks, fragile foundations, and urgent
corrections needed for AI to deliver value IN THIS REPORT [11]. 

 CODE EXECUTION WITH MCP: BUILDING MORE EFFICIENT AGENTS (15 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Code execution can enable agents to interact with MCP servers more
efficiently. When too many servers are connected, tool definitions and
results can consume excessive tokens, reducing agent efficiency. Many
of the problems with MCP feel novel, but they have known solutions
from software engineering. Code execution applies established patterns
to agents, letting them use familiar programming constructs to
interact with MCP servers more efficiently. 

 RUN ANY LLM WITH A SINGLE API: INTRODUCING ANY-LLM V1.0 (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 any-llm is an interface that can use any model, cloud or local,
without requiring a rewrite of the stack every time. It makes it easy
for developers to use any large language model without being locked
into a single provider. any-llm decouples project logic from model
provider with a stable and consistent API surface. 

 PROFILING WITH CURSOR 2.0: THE MISSING LAYER IN AI CODE GENERATION (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Profiling is the best way to separate code that looks good from code
that is actually good. The Pyroscope Performance Profiler is a Cursor
extension that takes profiling data and paints it right on the code.
It allows developers to look at multiple solutions generated by
different agents and pick the best based on real numbers. Performance
comparisons across deployments, trend analysis, and incident
inspection can all be done inside the editor without going to a
separate UI. 

 EXPLORING A SPACE-BASED, SCALABLE AI INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM DESIGN (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google will launch two satellites carrying its AI chips, called TPUs,
in 2027, in hopes that in the mid-2030s space-based data centers will
become more cost efficient since solar panels are up to 8x effective
in orbit. Project Suncatcher envisions a constellation connected by
optical inter-satellite links to power distributed ML tasks, like AI
inference.

 AMAZON SENDS PERPLEXITY A CEASE AND DESIST OVER ITS AI AGENTS
SHOPPING FOR YOU (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Amazon has demanded that Perplexity stop its agentic web browser from
buying products on behalf of humans. It claims that the Comet browser
degrades the shopping and customer service experience that Amazon
provides. Amazon has accused Perplexity of violating its terms of
service and committing computer fraud by failing to disclose when an
AI is shopping for a user. Perplexity responded by accusing Amazon of
bullying and using litigation to stifle innovation. 

 THE COMPANY QUIETLY FUNNELING PAYWALLED ARTICLES TO AI DEVELOPERS (10
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 At the heart of AI web scraping is Common Crawl, a small nonprofit
that supplies, and is funded by, major AI labs with internet data
while flagrantly disregarding paywalls and removal requests. The
organization has gathered millions of articles from The New York
Times, The Atlantic, and other publishers (many of them now suing AI
companies), but has avoided compliance by making its search tool
return "no captures" for domains that actually contain thousands of
articles.

development.
