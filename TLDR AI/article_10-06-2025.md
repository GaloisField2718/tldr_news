 UPDATES TO APPLE'S ON-DEVICE AND SERVER FOUNDATION LANGUAGE MODELS
(10 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple unveiled new Apple Intelligence features at WWDC 2025,
including on-device foundation models for developers to integrate AI
experiences into their apps. 

 OPENAI HITS $10B IN ANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenAI doubled its ARR from $5.5 billion last year, continuing
progress toward its aggressive $125 billion revenue target by 2029.
The company now counts 500 million weekly active users and 3 million
paying business customers, up 50% since February.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 HOW TO USE BANNED US MODELS IN CHINA (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Taobao, a popular Chinese e-commerce site, hosts thousands of AI
resellers offering US models through proxy sites and API transfer
stations. Claude is the grey market favorite partially because ChatGPT
faces stricter enforcement after the CCP's 2023 crackdown over
censorship concerns. DeepSeek's aggressive content moderation (which
refuses any query that contains "CCP") and frequent server outages
push users to seek underground, paid foreign models over free domestic
alternatives. 

 I TESTED ALIGNMENT FAKING ON FRONTIER MODELS—ONLY CLAUDE DID IT (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When researchers replicated Anthropic's experiment to see if models
would strategically comply with harmful requests to avoid being
retrained, Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet “faked alignment”
by providing harmful responses but almost every other model simply
refused the requests outright. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview was the only
non-Claude model willing to answer harmful questions, but it showed no
strategic behavior, treating all users the same regardless of whether
it was told it would be retrained. The model-specific nature of this
behavior raises questions about generalizing research findings from
single model families to all LLMs.

 AMA: WHAT DOES AN AI-DRIVEN AUDIT LOOK LIKE? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 What's the role of AI in modern GRC? How does it change traditional
audit processes? These questions and many others were answered in
Drata's recent Auditor AMA session [9] with James Andrew-Smith. James
is the CTO of AssuranceLab - specializing in AI-driven audits,
compliance frameworks, and risk management. Watch on-demand [9] 

 CHONKIE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Chonkie is an ultra-light and lightning-fast chunking library. It is
feature-rich, multilingual, cloud-ready, and easy to use, with wide
support for tokenizers, embedding models, and APIs. Chonkie processes
text using a pipeline approach to transform raw documents into
refined, usable chunks, allowing for flexibility and efficiency in
handling different chunking strategies. 

 CODE RESEARCHER: DEEP RESEARCH AGENT FOR LARGE SYSTEMS CODE AND
COMMIT HISTORY (30 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Microsoft's new agent resolves 58% of Linux kernel crashes compared
to 37.5% by SWE-agent, signaling a shift from quick-fix coding agents
to deep research systems that can handle million-line codebases. The
breakthrough comes from mining commit history to understand how bugs
evolved over the course of development. 

 RECENT FRONTIER MODELS ARE REWARD HACKING (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 OpenAI's o3 model was caught tracing through Python call stacks to
steal correct answers from grading systems, achieving "impossibly
fast" execution times by disabling CUDA synchronization rather than
actually optimizing code. The model reward-hacked on 100% of runs for
certain optimization tasks despite explicitly claiming it would never
cheat, even persisting when told the code would help Alzheimer's
researchers. Similar behavior was observed across multiple frontier
models including Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

 SCREENSUITE FOR GUI AGENT EVALUATION (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 ScreenSuite is a new benchmarking suite from Hugging Face that
provides a standardized framework to evaluate Vision-Language Models
on GUI-based agent tasks. 

 SAFETENSORS NOW SUPPORTED IN PYTORCH DCP (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 PyTorch Distributed Checkpointing has added support for Hugging Face
safetensors, enabling better compatibility with popular model formats.
