 TIM COOK TO 'HINT' AT APPLE AI FEATURES DURING IPAD LAUNCH (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Apple CEO Tim Cook is anticipated to tease new AI features during the
"Let Loose" event next week, with further details expected at the WWDC
in June. The new iPad Pro models may receive the M4 chip, hinting at
potential advanced AI capabilities in Apple's upcoming products. 

 MAJOR U.S. NEWSPAPERS SUE OPENAI, MICROSOFT FOR COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Eight prominent U.S. newspapers owned by investment giant Alden
Global Capital are suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright
infringement in a complaint filed Tuesday in the Southern District of
New York. On top of a similar case filed by the New York Times against
both companies, the new suits add heft to publishers' claims. Until
now, the Times was the only major newspaper to take legal action
against AI firms for copyright infringement. 

 FRIENDS FROM THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD TURN RIVALS IN BIG TECH'S A.I. RACE
(6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, has been named the chief
executive of Microsoft AI. He will contribute to Microsoft's expansion
into AI consumer products, while his former colleague and DeepMind's
other co-founder, Demis Hassabis, will lead AI research at Google. The
journey of these two influential figures reflects the personal and
competitive undercurrents driving the race to develop the next major
computing platform.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 OPTIMIZING VISION TRANSFORMERS FOR EFFICIENT DEPLOYMENT (22 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 This study discusses how combining algorithmic adjustments with
tailored hardware can enhance ViTs' efficiency, particularly through
model quantization. 

 ADVANCING SPIKING NEURAL NETWORKS WITH SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING (22
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Spikformer V2 combines the self-attention mechanism with the
biological efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). This
innovative model uses a Spiking Self-Attention mechanism and a
Convolutional Stem, enhancing its ability to process visual features
while being energy-efficient. 

 SOUND EVENT DETECTION (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Full-Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FFDConv) is a new method that
enhances 2D convolution for sound event detection. By generating
unique frequency kernels for each band, FFDConv improves the accuracy
of detecting sound events, especially in terms of their frequency
characteristics.

 IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH ADVERSARIAL TUNING (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The Segment Anything Model (SAM) from Meta AI, a notable foundation
model in computer vision, excels at image segmentation but struggles
in certain specific areas. This project presents ASAM, an advancement
on SAM that uses adversarial tuning to boost its performance. 

 EFFICIENT AND HIGH-QUALITY 3D RENDERING (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This project introduces SUNDAE, a new approach that enhances memory
efficiency through spectral pruning and neural compensation. 

 VISUAL DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING (GITHUB REPO) [20] 

 InstructDr is a model designed to excel in various visual document
understanding tasks like question answering and information
extraction. InstructDr can adapt to new tasks and datasets by
combining document images with large language models, outperforming
existing models.

 SCALING LLMS TO 128K CONTEXT LENGTHS (GITHUB REPO) [21] 

 This study reveals a method to significantly extend the context
length of language models up to 128K, emphasizing the importance of
both the amount and variety of training data. 

 THE GREAT TALENT DIVIDEND AND NYC'S AI OPPORTUNITY (7 MINUTE READ)
[22] 

 NYC's ascendancy in AI highlights the city's robust talent pool and
growth as an AI hub. The NYC tech scene has drawn AI unicorns and tech
workers. It is fuelled by resources like elite universities and a $400
million AI Research Consortium fund. 

 HOW AI APPS MAKE MONEY (8 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 In recent years, the majority of AI applications have adopted
traditional subscription-based pricing models, with a focus on
per-user charges, reflecting their role as digital assistants rather
than replacements for human workers. Innovative pricing strategies,
such as outcome-based models, are emerging among newer AI companies,
potentially enhancing customer adoption and revenue by charging only
for successful results.
