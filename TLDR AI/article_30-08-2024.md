RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 THE MAMBA IN THE LLAMA: DISTILLING AND ACCELERATING HYBRID MODELS (31
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mambda models are hard to accelerate with speculative decoding
because of the lack of a KV cache for backtracking. This paper, from
some of the original authors, showcases some novel acceleration
algorithms and distillation methods. 

 EFFICIENT LLM SCHEDULING BY LEARNING TO RANK (24 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 When serving many concurrent requests to a large language model,
things often get bottlenecked because we don't know how long output
generation will be, so we get head of line bottlenecks. However, you
can learn to rank relative lengths between requests and serve the
shortest ones first, which leads to a 6.5x higher throughput for multi
batch generation. 

 MULTI-TASK SCENE UNDERSTANDING (16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MTMamba++ is a new model architecture designed to enhance multi-task
scene understanding. This approach uses a Mamba-based decoder
featuring two core blocks, STM and CTM, to capture long-range
dependencies and improve cross-task interactions.
