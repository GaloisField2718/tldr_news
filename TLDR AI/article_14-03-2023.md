HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

ALPACA: A STRONG OPEN-SOURCE INSTRUCTION-FOLLOWING MODEL (8 MINUTE
READ)
[https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html?utm_source=tldrai] 

Instruction-following models such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003),
ChatGPT, Claude, and Bing Chat have become increasingly powerful.
However, instruction-following models still have many deficiencies:
they can generate false information, propagate social stereotypes, and
produce toxic language. To make maximum progress on addressing these
pressing problems, it is important for the academic community to
engage. Alpaca is a model fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model on 52K
instruction-following demonstrations. 

TOGETHER RELEASES OPENCHATKIT (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit?utm_source=tldrai] 

OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both
specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications.
OpenChatKit is Together‚Äôs version of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. All of the
model‚Äôs weights, code, and training data are available online. And
it was even trained on 100% carbon-negative compute. 

GRAMMARLY LAUNCHES GRAMMARLYGO, GENERATIVE AI PRODUCT
[https://9to5google.com/2023/03/09/grammarly-ai-generative/?utm_source=tldrai]


Grammar-checking tool Grammarly is announcing support for a generative
AI tool that can write content in your personal writing style.
Launching in the coming months, ‚ÄúGrammarlyGO‚Äù is a generative AI
product that is designed to ‚Äúaccelerate productivity where people
write.‚Äù Like ChatGPT, GrammarlyGO is able to create text based on a
short prompt, though Grammarly‚Äôs special trick is that the content
generated copies your usual writing style

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

JENSEN'S INEQUALITY (24 MINUTE READ)
[https://francisbach.com/jensen-inequality/?utm_source=tldrai] 

An extremely useful inequality for applied mathematicians and machine
learning practitioners. This post explores this often backwards, but
useful, inequality. If you're hoping to learn more of the math behind
ML, this is a good piece to read. 

STYLEGANEX: RESCALING STYLEGAN WITH DILATED CONVOLUTIONS FOR ROBUST
UNALIGNED FACE MANIPULATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/williamyang1991/styleganex?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper proposes a solution to the limitations of StyleGAN, which
is restricted to cropped aligned faces at fixed image resolution. The
solution involves using dilated convolutions to rescale the receptive
fields of shallow layers in StyleGAN without altering model
parameters, resulting in features that can accommodate variable
resolutions and better characterize unaligned faces. Additionally, the
paper introduces an encoder that provides the first-layer feature of
the extended StyleGAN and validates the effectiveness of the method in
various face manipulation tasks, including super-resolution, facial
attribute editing, sketch/mask-to-face translation, and face
toonification. 

MVIMGNET: A LARGE-SCALE DATASET OF MULTI-VIEW IMAGES (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06042?utm_source=tldrai] 

The authors introduce MVImgNet, a large-scale dataset of multi-view
images for 3D vision. It contains 6.5 million frames from real-world
objects and bridges the gap between 2D and 3D vision. MVPNet, a 3D
object point cloud dataset, is also introduced.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

HYPER LIGHT SPEED GPT (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-gpt?utm_source=tldrai] 

Based on the NanoGPT repo, this code can train a decoder only
transformer model to somewhat reasonable perplexity in just 3 minutes.
It is designed to be simple to understand, hackable, with fast
convergence for researchers to explore their ideas. 

GUARDRAILS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ShreyaR/guardrails?utm_source=tldrai] 

Guardrails is a Python package that lets a user add structure, type,
and quality guarantees to the outputs of LLMs. 

WHISPERBOARD (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/Saik0s/Whisperboard?utm_source=tldrai] 

Whisperboard is an iOS app for recording and transcribing audio on the
go, based on OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper model.

THE HOT MESS THEORY OF AI MISALIGNMENT (11 MINUTE READ)
[https://sohl-dickstein.github.io/2023/03/09/coherence.html?utm_source=tldrai]


Many machine learning researchers worry about risks from building AI.
One popular AI risk centers on AGI misalignment. It posits that we
will build a superintelligent, super-capable, AI, but that the AI's
objectives will be misspecified and misaligned with human values. If
the AI is powerful enough, and pursues its objectives inflexibly
enough, then even a subtle misalignment might pose an existential risk
to humanity. 

GPT-4 UPGRADE WILL INCLUDE TEXT-TO-VIDEO (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://archive.ph/6pEyv?utm_source=tldrai] 

According to Microsoft Germany CTO Andreas Braun, OpenAI‚Äôs upcoming
GPT-4 upgrade will allow users to turn text into video. Braun added
that the more powerful AI will be introduced this week, putting an end
to speculation over its release. "We will introduce GPT-4 next week,
where we will have multimodal models that will offer completely
different possibilities ‚Äì for example, videos," Braun said.
