 INTRODUCING WEB-WORLD MODELS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Convergence's AI Agent, Proxy [4] just achieved state of the art
results on the WebVoyager benchmark, topping Claude Computer Use
(Anthropic), Agent E (Emergence), and Runner H (H Company).

This benchmark consists of tasks like shopping, hotel booking, and map
use. More importantly, it is conducted using real websites rather than
simulated scenarios.

Click here for early access to Proxy [4], we are planning to open
source it in the new year!
