 TOOLS TO ALIGN AI PRICING WITH VALUE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 It might seem like everyone is struggling with sustainable
monetization for AI, but Metronome works with the companies who have
actually figured it out - Anyscale, NVIDIA, Databricks, and many
others. Their team has created two resources [4] to help you do the
same:

1️⃣ Self-assessment (5 minutes) [4]: Answer 8 quick questions to
discover which pricing model best fits how your customers get value
from your product.

2️⃣ The Pricing Experimentation Playbook [4]: This guide can help
you test, validate, and optimize your pricing strategy. (Complete the
assessment to get the most out of the guide.)

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC PREPARING NEW AGENTIC TASKS MODE FOR CLAUDE (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Anthropic is testing a new interface for tasks in Claude's Agent
mode. It is also introducing new modes for research, analysis,
writing, and building. The updated interface introduces a toggle that
allows users to switch between classic chat and agent modes.
Screenshots of the new interface are available in the article. 

 NVIDIA DEBUTS NEMOTRON 3 FAMILY OF OPEN MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nvidia released Nemotron 3 Nano (30B parameters, 3B active) with
Super (100B) and Ultra (500B) coming in early 2026, with Nano's
benchmark scores rivaling or exceeding closed-source rivals. Nvidia is
publishing training data and releasing libraries for agent
customization in what appears to be an attempt to undermine OpenAI,
Google, and Anthropic, which are increasingly developing their own
chips instead of using Nvidia. 

 DISNEY-OPENAI LICENSING DEAL IS ONE-YEAR EXCLUSIVE (1 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Disney's new partnership with OpenAI allows Sora to use over 200
characters from its IP catalog for one exclusive year. After that,
Disney is free to partner with other AI platforms, hinting at broader
content licensing strategies.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 SELF IMPROVING AGENT WITH DYNAMIC CONTEXT AND CONTINUOUS LEARNING (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This guide walks readers through how to build a self-improving
Text-to-SQL agent using dynamic context and 'poor-man's continuous
learning'. The agent answers questions by retrieving data from a
knowledge base. It learns from successful runs by adding to the
knowledge base, creating a self-improving feedback loop. A video that
shows the agent in action is available at the end of the article. 

 GPT-5.2 IS FRONTIER ONLY FOR THE FRONTIER (31 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GPT-5.2 is good at instruction following and a solid choice, but it
isn't 'fun' to interact with. People strongly dislike its personality.
The model is heavily constrained and censored. It is not likely to
solve OpenAI's 'Code Red' problems. The company will likely try again
in a month with GPT-5.3. 

 WHEN MACHINES PAY MACHINES: THE ECONOMICS OF AGENTIC AI (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 x402 is a protocol that embeds payments directly into HTTP, allowing
any API call to include a payment. It has processed over 100 million
payments across APIs, applications, and AI agents since launching in
May this year. This article takes a look at the protocol and how
internet-native payments are becoming standard infrastructure. 

 AI AGENTS ARE STARTING TO EAT SAAS (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Basic SaaS providers now have thousands of new competitors: engineers
with a spare Friday afternoon with an agent. Not all SaaS products
will be affected, but the bar is going to be much higher for those
that don't have a clear moat or proprietary knowledge. Companies with
strong internal technical ability will be able to replace their SaaS
spend, decreasing costs, while those who don't will see dramatically
increasing costs as Saas providers try to recoup lost sales.

 🆕 SHOPIFY'S AGENTIC STOREFRONTS LETS YOU SURFACE PRODUCTS ACROSS
EVERY AI PLATFORM (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Virtual try-on apps, AR-VR, voice - AI is opening up exciting new
ways to build consumer shopping experiences. Agentic Storefronts (part
of Shopify's Winter '26 release [12]) unlock AI-powered shopping for
merchants with a new set of tools to help you ensure your products are
discoverable and your brand stays authentic in agentic conversations.

 STRUCTURED OUTPUTS CREATE FALSE CONFIDENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Constrained decoding forces models to prioritize output conformance
over output quality. This is because it restricts models to only
consider certain tokens. Using structured output makes it harder for
models to refuse requests, warn users about contradictory information,
and inform users of the right approach when they ask it to use the
wrong approach. Letting models respond in as natural a fashion as
possible is the most effective way to get the highest quality response
from them. 

 BRING YOUR RESEARCH TO LIFE WITH INTEGRATED VISUAL REPORTS FROM
GEMINI DEEP RESEARCH (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google AI Ultra subscribers can now use Gemini Deep Research to
generate rich visual reports complete with custom images, charts, and
interactive simulations. The update can automatically illustrate data
and create dynamic simulation models to forecast outcomes based on
different variables. The feature combines deep analysis with dynamic
visuals to transform dense data into tangible, easy-to-understand
insights. 

 OLMO 3: A DEEP DIVE INTO THE FULLY-OPEN LLM (30 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI2 published the most comprehensive starting point for open LLM
research: all checkpoints, training data, and code for OLMo 3. The
walkthrough covers every stage from data mixing through the full
SFT/DPO/RLVR post-training stack, including OlmoRL infrastructure that
cuts RL training from 15 days to 6 days. RL with random rewards, which
worked on Qwen, fails on OLMo 3. 

 200K TOKENS IS PLENTY (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Claude Opus 4.5 is considered the best model for coding, and it only
has a context window of roughly 200,000 tokens. While some people feel
like that is not a lot, that can be plenty for developers who use
short threads. The best threads are short, with just the right amount
of context. The longer the conversation, the more an agent's context
window gets filled up with junk. You only need to give agents the
context they need to get the job done, and no more.

 TERENCE TAO DOUBTS THAT ANYTHING RESEMBLING GENUINE "ARTIFICIAL
GENERAL INTELLIGENCE" IS WITHIN REACH OF CURRENT AI TOOLS (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 While 'artificial general intelligence' may be out of reach,
'artificial general cleverness' is becoming a reality in many ways.
General cleverness is the ability to solve broad classes of complex
problems via somewhat ad hoc means. While this doesn't qualify as true
intelligence, it can result in a non-trivial success rate in a wide
spectrum of tasks. Viewing the current generation of tools as a
generator of clever thoughts and outputs may be a more productive
perspective when trying to use them to solve difficult problems. 

 GOOGLE EXPANDS GEMINI WITH NOTEBOOKLM INTEGRATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 NotebookLM integration within Google Gemini lets users attach and
utilize their notebooks as live data sources. This update, currently
limited to select accounts, supports multiple notebook attachments for
personalized data processing. Google plans to broaden Gemini's
practical utility and reach, rolling out the feature to free accounts.
