INTRODUCING MICROSOFT SECURITY COPILOT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?utm_source=tldrai]


Microsoft Security Copilot is an AI-powered security analysis tool
that enables analysts to respond to threats quickly, process signals
at machine speed, and assess risk exposure in minutes. Microsoft
Security Copilot is currently in preview and still waiting for public
release. 

CAN CHATGPT FILL IN MENTORSHIP GAPS FOR GEN Z WORKERS? (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.worklife.news/technology/chatgpt-gen-z/?utm_source=tldrai]


ChatGPT, launched at the end of 2022, is being considered as a
potential tool to address mentorship gaps for Gen Z workers. The AI
tool can help new employees in various industries, like journalism, by
answering questions about interviews or workplace etiquette that they
may not have a mentor to consult. While ChatGPT provides helpful
generic advice, experts caution against relying on it too much, as it
cannot offer personalized guidance or replace the learning experiences
gained from making mistakes.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

LESS DEEP LEARNING AND MORE LONG LEARNING (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2023-03-27-long-learning?utm_source=tldrai]


A nice summary of the recent line of work from Stanford trying to
dramatically increase the context window for language models. If we
could take in longer prompts or output longer generations, this may
open up a world of tasks such as full book summarization, repository
level code edits, and multi modal video generation 

GPTEVAL: NLG EVALUATION USING GPT-4 WITH BETTER HUMAN ALIGNMENT (7
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634?utm_source=tldrai] 

GPTEVAL introduces a groundbreaking framework that leverages large
language models with chain-of-thoughts and form-filling paradigms to
assess the quality of natural language generation outputs.
Demonstrating a remarkable improvement in correlation with human
judgments, this novel approach also uncovers potential biases in
LLM-based evaluators. 

‚àû-DIFF: INFINITE RESOLUTION DIFFUSION (18 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18242?utm_source=tldrai] 

‚àû-Diff is introduced as a novel generative diffusion model that
operates on infinite resolution data, learning a continuous function
for sampling at any resolution. This approach surpasses other infinite
resolution models by working directly on raw data, yielding higher
sample quality and scaling effectively to resolutions beyond the
training data.

IMAGE GENERATION WITH MULTIVIEW 2D DIFFUSION MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[https://jeffreyxiang.github.io/ivid/?utm_source=tldrai] 

This paper presents a groundbreaking 3D-aware image generation
technique that employs 2D diffusion models in a multiview 2D image set
generation framework. By incorporating depth information and training
on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, the method achieves superior
image quality and generates images with large view angles from diverse
real-world environments. 

NANO BIND C++ TO PYTHON (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html?utm_source=tldrai]


From the author of the immensely popular pybind11 framework for
connecting low level code to python we have another (hopefully
simpler) framework. They found that since their code is a massive
dependency for many popular libraries such as Pytorch it has grown in
complexity. Nano bind won't support every feature in every version of
C++ which allows it to be far simpler and lightweight. 

CHROMA (GITHUB REPO)

communicate, paving the way for humans to one day connect with
computers through mere thinking. 

OPENAI HAS BEEN HIT WITH A FTC COMPLAINT (1 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.engadget.com/openai-may-have-to-halt-chatgpt-releases-following-ftc-complaint-172824646.html?src=rss?utm_source=tldrai]


An FTC complaint from the nonprofit research organization Center for
AI and Digital Policy (CAIDP) could put a temporary stop to the
deployment of ChatGPT.
