 OPENAI IS RESTARTING ITS ROBOTICS RESEARCH GROUP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is reviving its robotics research group after a three-year
hiatus, aiming to develop multimodal robotics models and improve core
AI models. 

 AI OVERVIEWS: ABOUT LAST WEEK (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google introduced AI Overviews to enhance search results, providing
users with more accurate and relevant information, especially for
complex queries. While some issues arose, such as erroneous results
and misinterpreted content, Google has implemented over a dozen
technical improvements to address these challenges, including better
detection of nonsensical queries and limiting user-generated content
in AI Overviews. 

 NVIDIA SAID TO BE PREPPING AI PC CHIP WITH ARM AND BLACKWELL CORES (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Nvidia is reportedly preparing a system-on-chip that pairs Arm's
Cortex-X5 core design with GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell
architecture.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MUP FOR SPARSE MODELS (26 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 muP is a powerful tool used by all frontier model labs to transfer
hyper parameters tuned on small models to larger, more expensive
training runs. This paper explores how to do that for sparse models,
thus dramatically improving training performance while reducing
compute costs. 

 EXPERIMENTING WITH LOCAL ALT TEXT GENERATION (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mozilla has trained a model that can run in the browser and
automatically generate alt text for web images. 

 RANDOM COLOR ERASING BOOSTS MODEL ROBUSTNESS IN COMPUTER VISION (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed a new learning strategy called Random
Color Erasing to tackle color bias in computer vision. This method
balances the importance of color and other features by selectively
removing color information from training data, leading to models that
perform better in complex scenarios like wide-area surveillance and
industrial applications.

 VIDEO GENERATION WITH MORA (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Mora is an innovative video generation model that leverages multiple
visual AI agents to challenge Sora, the leading model by OpenAI. 

 BOOSTING LLM'S ABILITY TO FOLLOW COMPLEX INSTRUCTIONS (GITHUB REPO)
[14] 

 Conifer improves LLMs' understanding of complex instructions by
introducing a specialized dataset and a progressive learning approach.


 FABRIC FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE IMAGE GENERATION QUALITY (GITHUB REPO)
[15] 

 FABRIC is an inference time, training-free method for improving image
quality by using a scoring function or image examples to direct output
quality.

 KL IS ALL YOU NEED (18 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 KL divergence is a fast, cheap, and powerful way to measure a kind of
distance between things. It is used copiously in traditional and
modern AI. This post explores the powerful concept visually and
mathematically. 

 BEYOND THE CLOUD TO EDGE AI (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI is moving to multimodal and the edge. How will that change our use
of it and where it is effective? 

 EX-OPENAI BOARD MEMBER REVEALS WHAT LED TO SAM ALTMAN'S BRIEF OUSTING
(3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner revealed new details about
what led to CEO Sam Altman's ousting in November in a recent
interview. The board had apparently learned about ChatGPT's release on
Twitter. Toner says that Altman had lied to the board multiple times.
Altman was reportedly withholding information and misrepresenting
things that were happening in the company for years. His lies made it
difficult for the board to make decisions, leading them to think that
he wasn't the right person to lead the company to AGI.
