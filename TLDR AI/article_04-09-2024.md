 üè∑Ô∏è FOR SALE: YOUR PERSONAL DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A legal loophole allows data brokers to collect your personal data
and sell it to the highest bidder. This is used for all sorts of
nefarious purposes - from spam email [4] to more convincing deepfake
calls (thanks, AI!).

To get your data off these websites, you need to either:

 	* Contact dozens of them individually; or
 	* Sign up to Incogni [4] and never think about it again.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ANTHROPIC QUICKSTART REPO (GITHUB REPO) [5] 

 Anthropic has released a useful set of starter projects. It has
partnered with former heads of AI from Brex, Uber, Facebook, and
others to help write the first Quickstart, a scalable customer service
agent powered by Claude. 

 AI HAS CREATED A BATTLE OVER WEB CRAWLING (11 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A report by the Data Provenance Initiative warns that generative AI
models may suffer as websites increasingly restrict crawler bots,
blocking access to high-quality data. This trend, driven by fears of
data misuse, could shift AI training reliance from well-maintained
sources to lower-quality data. Companies may turn to synthetic data or
direct licensing to maintain AI model efficacy amid growing data
scarcity. 

 CEO OF OPENAI JAPAN REVEALS PLANS FOR GPT NEXT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's GPT Next will be trained with approximately 100x the compute
load of GPT-4. It will be released later this year. The true estimates
suggest some of the compute load changes are also due to algorithmic
improvements. The article is in Japanese.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 WHAT SUCCEEDING AT AI SAFETY WILL INVOLVE (37 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sam from Anthropic puts forward a guess as to what developers will
need to accomplish for AI safety to succeed during the development of
superhuman AI systems. 

 SCALING VISION MAMBA MODELS (18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a stochastic layer-wise shuffle regularization
technique to overcome overfitting in Vision Mamba models, enabling
them to scale up to 300M parameters while maintaining competitive
performance with Vision Transformers (ViTs). 

 ENHANCING FINE-GRAINED SCENE UNDERSTANDING (26 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have developed Stable Control Representations to improve
the fine-grained scene understanding in embodied AI agents. By using
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, these representations
capture detailed visuo-spatial information necessary for complex
tasks.

 THE MISSING GUIDE TO THE H100 MARKET (18 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This guide covers essential aspects of GPU purchasing, including
pricing for different options, ensuring reliability, the importance of
other hardware specs, and availability considerations. It addresses
key questions buyers face when navigating the GPU market, from cost to
performance and logistics. 

 STABLE VISUAL ODOMETRY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This project provides a deep reinforcement learning framework to
improve the stability of visual odometry (VO) systems in environments
with challenging lighting conditions. 

 DETECTING RARE CARDIAC ANOMALIES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An advanced ECG diagnostic system that uses self-supervised anomaly
detection pretraining to improve the detection of rare but critical
cardiac anomalies.

 RELIANT'S PAPER-SCOURING AI TAKES ON SCIENCE'S DATA DRUDGERY (5
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Reliant AI, co-founded by Karl Moritz Hermann, has secured a $11.3
million seed round to automate time-intensive literature reviews in
academia with its AI product Tabular, which boasts zero-error data
extraction from scientific publications. Utilizing LLMs and
proprietary techniques, Reliant provides a user-friendly UI for
researchers, improving efficiency over traditional methods. Its
in-house hardware approach underscores a commitment to high-quality,
domain-specific AI solutions for the research industry. 

 THE ORDER OF ENGINEERS ON THE FRONT LINE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI engineering is central to advancing AI technologies, with a
particular emphasis on ethical development and responsible
implementation. Professional orders, such as Italy's C3i, maintain
quality standards and support engineers through continual training and
ethical guidelines. The evolving field requires engineers to
continuously update skills, innovate, and collaborate across
disciplines to harness AI's full potential responsibly. 

 LEVERAGING AI FOR EFFICIENT INCIDENT RESPONSE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta has introduced an AI-assisted root cause analysis system using
heuristic retrieval and LLM-based ranking, achieving a 42% accuracy
rate in pinpointing root causes in its web monorepo investigations.
Fine-tuning the Llama 2 model on historical data has been key to
enhancing system accuracy. The company plans to expand AI tool
integration, aiming for proactive risk mitigation and autonomous
workflows.
