 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS TRANSFORMING MIDDLE-CLASS JOBS. CAN IT
ALSO HELP THE POOR? (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Generative AI adoption is surging globally, with 66% of leaders
prioritizing AI skills over traditional experience. However, access
disparities hinder adoption in developing regions, where only a small
percentage can leverage GenAI due to limited digital infrastructure.
Addressing infrastructure and education gaps is crucial to prevent AI
from widening global inequalities. 

 A NEW WAY TO TEST AI FOR SENTIENCE: MAKE IT CONFRONT PAIN (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Researchers from Google DeepMind and LSE conducted a study using a
text-based game to explore AI "sentience," testing LLMs by having them
choose between options with varying pain and pleasure associations.
Findings revealed some models prioritized avoiding pain over scoring
points, suggesting a potential framework for assessing AI
consciousness. 

 AI'S CODING PROMISES, AND OPENAI'S LONGEVITY PUSH (6 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The second wave of AI coding is advancing, allowing models to
prototype, test, and debug code, potentially moving developers into
more supervisory roles. OpenAI has entered longevity science with a
model that designs proteins to transform cells into stem cells,
claiming results surpassing human efforts. Cleaner jet fuels from
alternative sources are gaining momentum, promising significant
emission reductions and prompting industry shifts.
