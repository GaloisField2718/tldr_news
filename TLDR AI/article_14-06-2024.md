HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MICROSOFT IS BUILDING AN AI EMPIRE (12 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has diversified Microsoft's AI
investments by partnering with AI startups and building an in-house AI
team led by Mustafa Suleyman. This strategy includes significant
investments, including $1.5 billion in an Abu Dhabi-based AI firm. It
aims to create internal AI capabilities potentially rivaling OpenAI. 

 OPENAI ADDS FORMER NSA CHIEF TO ITS BOARD (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI is adding former NSA head and retired General Paul Nakasone to
its board of directors as well as its newly formed Safety and Security
Committee. 

 APPLE MADE ONCE-UNLIKELY DEAL WITH SAM ALTMAN TO CATCH UP IN AI (8
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple and OpenAI have forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI's
ChatGPT into iOS. The agreement was a key focus for Apple's Worldwide
Developers Conference. The partnership is likely a short- to
medium-term relationship for Apple, which is developing its own AI
features. Apple is still in talks with Google about using Gemini in
its devices. The company is also looking beyond chatbots - it is
currently working on a mobile robot that can follow users around and
handle chores on their behalf and AI features for its AirPods and
cameras.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LLM-SQUARED (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sakana AI has employed an evolutionary strategy to find a preference
optimization scheme that outperforms DPO. It used a language model to
suggest code and then trained models based on that code. After 100 or
so generations, it had several proposed variants with extremely high
performance. 

 RECAPTIONING BILLIONS OF IMAGES WITH LLAMA 3 (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Recaptioning web scraped images with a vision model dramatically
improves downstream model performance. This is especially true in
models such as CLIP. 

 CREATING IMMERSIVE AUDIO (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces DiffRIR, a new framework designed to
reconstruct the spatial acoustic characteristics of environments using
a small number of room impulse response (RIR) recordings and a planar
scene reconstruction.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 WANT TO SLOW DOWN SPAM CALLS AND EMAIL? START BY DELETING YOUR
PERSONAL DATA (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Spam starts with your personal data being sold. The culprit: Data
brokers who profit from your home address, SSN, phone number, and
more. The solution: Incogni [11] scrubs your personal info from the
web. 3 minutes to set up, 180+ data brokers' and people-search sites
[11] tackled.

 SAMBA: A SIMPLE MAMBA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Microsoft has trained a Mamba-based model on the Phi 3 dataset. It
dramatically outperforms the transformer variant on MMLU, HumanEval,
and retrieval. 

 DIFFUSIONKIT MLX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Framework and tooling for running diffusion models on Apple's MLX
framework. 

 MASKED DIFFUSION MODELS FOR LANGUAGE MODELING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Researchers have demonstrated that masked discrete diffusion models
can rival autoregressive methods in language modeling by applying an
effective training recipe and introducing a simplified
Rao-Blackwellized objective.
