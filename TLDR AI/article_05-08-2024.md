 AI EXISTENTIAL RISK PROBABILITIES ARE TOO UNRELIABLE TO INFORM POLICY
(25 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This essay critiques the use of AI existential risk probability
estimates for policy making, arguing that they are too unreliable and
lack a solid inductive or deductive basis, often resembling educated
guesses rather than evidence-based forecasts. The authors challenge
the legitimacy of these forecasts in guiding public policy, especially
when linked to costly or freedom-limiting actions, and advocate for an
evidence-based approach that acknowledges uncertainty in AI
progression. They propose focusing on definable AI milestones for more
meaningful policy decisions while cautioning against leveraging
speculative existential risk probabilities in high-impact decisions. 

 IS AI JUDGING THE FUTURE OF GYMNASTICS OR JUST A SURVEILLANCE TOOL?
(27 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has teamed with Fujitsu
to launch an AI-assisted judging support system at the World
Gymnastics Championships, aiming for fairer, more transparent scoring.
The Judging Support System (JSS), which will not replace judges,
offers 3D model-based second opinions in difficult cases and inquiry
disputes, with scope for future improvements and broader applications.
Despite concerns over replacing human judgment, the JSS may enhance
scoring accuracy and consistency, vital in a sport where minimal point
differences greatly impact rankings and athletes' careers.
