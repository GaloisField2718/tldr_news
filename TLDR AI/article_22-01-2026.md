 AI IS WRITING MORE CODE. SOMEONE STILL HAS TO REVIEW IT. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 That review step is where bugs slip through, context gets lost, and
teams slow down.

GREPTILE [4] reviews each PR with full repo context and learns your
team's conventions over time from comments, reactions, and what gets
merged. It flags issues and suggests fixes that match your team, not
generic best practices.

✅ Now integrated with CLAUDE CODE: install via /PLUGIN.

✅ Free for open source.

✅ Trusted by engineering teams at NVIDIA, SCALE AI, AND BREX. [5]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CLAUDE'S NEW CONSTITUTION (12 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic has published a new constitution for Claude. The document
is a detailed description of Anthropic's vision for Claude's values
and behavior that explains the context in which Claude operates and
the kind of entity the company would like Claude to be. The
constitution is a crucial part of the model training process, and its
content directly shapes Claude's behavior. This post describes what's
included in the new constitution and some of the considerations that
informed Anthropic's approach. 

 OPENAI'S ALTMAN MEETS MIDEAST INVESTORS FOR $50 BILLION ROUND (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has been meeting with investors in the
Middle East to line up funding for a new investment round that could
total at least $50 billion. He recently visited the region, where he
spoke with some of the leading state-backed funds in Abu Dhabi. The
talks are early, and the amount could change. OpenAI has also recently
held talks with Amazon to raise at least $10 billion. 

 META'S NEW AI TEAM DELIVERED FIRST KEY MODELS INTERNALLY THIS MONTH,
CTO SAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Meta's new artificial intelligence lab has delivered its first
high-profile models internally. The company's CTO, Andrew Bosworth,
says the models show a lot of promise. There is still a tremendous
amount of work required in the post-training phase before the models
can be delivered in a way that's usable internally and by consumers.
Meta is starting to see favorable returns from its big gambits in
2025. The next two years will be important for bringing consumer
products to market.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 PASS@K IS MOSTLY BUNK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Pass@k is the probability that at least one of k different attempts
will succeed. It is one of the most common metrics used for agents.
The problem with the metric is that it's exponentially forgiving, and
humans interacting with agents aren't nearly that forgiving. Pass@k
should be a metric that's rarely used, and carefully justified every
time it is used. 

 GLM4-MOE INFERENCE WITH SGLANG (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Novita AI introduced performance optimizations for GLM4-MoE models
using SGLang, achieving faster Time-to-First-Token and better token
generation speed under agentic coding workloads.

disappoint. While developers blame the protocol, enterprise adoption
tells a different story. Companies are deploying MCP servers, and
integrations are live. This post breaks down why MCP servers fail,
best practices for building ones that work, and how Skills and MCP
complement each other.
