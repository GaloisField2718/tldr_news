 MICROSOFT‚ÄôS COPILOT APP IS NOW AVAILABLE ON IOS (1 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Microsoft has rolled out its Copilot AI chatbot app for iOS and
iPadOS. The app allows users to access GPT-4 without paying for a
subscription and ask questions, draft emails, summarize text, and
create images. Microsoft's rebrand of Bing Chat to Copilot shows that
the company is moving towards offering a standalone experience similar
to ChatGPT. There is also a web experience for Copilot that is
separate from Bing. 

 STUFF WE FIGURED OUT ABOUT AI IN 2023 (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 This article attempts to round up the highlights in AI development
over 2023. It covers how to run LLMs on personal devices, fine-tuning
models, the problem of gullibility, LLM applications, and more. LLMs
can provide people who use them effectively with a significant boost
to their quality of life. They're actually quite easy to build, but
there's still a lot unknown about them and they're still unreliable
for many applications. 

 HOW IBM SEES AI CHANGING THE GAME (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI technology is transforming businesses in various industries.
IBM‚Äôs VP of Software and Technology Raj Datta and Director of
Startups Kylie Rutherford share in this article how AI is changing the
game for companies of all sizes, presenting some use cases of various
products.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 MOSAICBERT: A BIDIRECTIONAL ENCODER OPTIMIZED FOR FAST PRETRAINING
(12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 BERT is an Encoder-only Transformer. This means it is often used to
represent natural language in the form of embeddings and isn‚Äôt
usually used to generate text. Importantly, it was one of the first
Transformers used in search because it can represent both the query
and the information to be retrieved. The team at Mosaic has integrated
FlashAttention, GLU, and many other innovations to dramatically
improve pretraining speed (1 hour, $20) while matching the performance
of much larger traditional BERT models. 

 IMPROVING TEXT EMBEDDINGS WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (18 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Researchers at Microsoft used synthetic data to train a decoder-only
transformer based on Mistral for embeddings. It is best in class.
Interestingly, they use a two-step prompting strategy with GPT-4 to
generate the synthetic retrieval training data. 

 IMAGES ALTERED TO TRICK MACHINE VISION CAN INFLUENCE HUMANS TOO (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Recent research reveals that subtle changes made to digital images to
deceive AI vision systems can also influence human perception. While
humans and AI perceive images differently, the study found that
humans, under controlled conditions, can be systematically biased by
adversarial perturbations designed to mislead AI.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 LLM COURSE (21 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A modern look at hot topics in the LLM space like merging, GGUF,
quantization, DPO, and more. It is designed for beginners, scientists,
and engineers to dive into the field and get up to speed quickly. 

 LLAMA FILE ONE-LINERS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Llamafile is a project that embeds the model and inference code into
a single portable executable. This blog explores how to pipe command
line output into the language model for further processing. 

 UNVEILING GEMINI'S POTENTIAL: A STUDY OF MULTIMODAL COMMONSENSE
REASONING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This project introduces an in-depth analysis of Google's Gemini, a
Multimodal Large Language Model, assessing its performance in common
sense reasoning across various tasks. The study, which compares Gemini
with other models, reveals its competitive abilities in integrating
knowledge across modalities.

 LLMS AND PROGRAMMING IN THE FIRST DAYS OF 2024 (15 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In 2023, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become invaluable for
programmers, significantly accelerating code writing and understanding
complex APIs or frameworks. While they have limitations in complex
system programming, LLMs excel in high-level Python coding and mundane
tasks, serving as an efficient tool for enhancing productivity and as
a condensed form of documentation. 

 SINGLE IMAGE SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH IMPROVED STABILITY (14 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Researchers have developed a new method that improves single image
super-resolution by focusing on two key aspects: the optimal centroid
of potential high-resolution images and the inherent noise that
affects image quality.
