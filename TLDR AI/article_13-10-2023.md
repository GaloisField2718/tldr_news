HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STATE OF AI 2023 (20 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.stateof.ai/2023-report-launch?utm_source=tldrai] 

 A great summary of the language modeling industry. There are good
discussions here on safety, capabilities, chips, and more. The
predictions around AI filmmaking, capital costs, and AI-fueled IPOs
are interesting. 

 OPENAI UNVEILS MAJOR UPDATES TO BOOST AI DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.gizmochina.com/2023/10/12/openai-unveils-major-updates-to-boost-ai-development-efficiency/?utm_source=tldrai]


 OpenAI plans to introduce updates like memory storage and advanced
vision capabilities in its developer tools to significantly reduce
application costs and foster innovation across diverse sectors. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS AI-POWERED SEARCH EXPERIENCE CAN NOW GENERATE IMAGES (2
MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23913337/google-ai-powered-search-sge-images-written-drafts?utm_source=tldrai]


 Google‚Äôs Search Generative Experience now lets you create images
right from a text prompt.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SPEED UP COLD BOOT TIMES FOR LLAMA 2 (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.anyscale.com/blog/loading-llama-2-70b-20x-faster-with-anyscale-endpoints?utm_source=tldrai]


 Loading a model from cloud storage to a node GPU often takes most of
the time for inference. With a few clever tricks like memory
streaming, Anyscale has reduced it 20x to just arrived 30s for Llama 2
70B. 

 TEXT EMBEDDINGS REVEAL ALMOST AS MUCH AS TEXT (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06816?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Using iterative re-embedding and treating embedding inversion as a
conditional generation problem allows attackers to successfully
recreate 92% of the embedded texts just with access to the dense
vectors. 

 ENHANCED SEGMENTATION WITH SAM-OCTA (16 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07183v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Researchers have improved the segmentation of specific targets in
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images with a method
called SAM-OCTA.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 SCALECRAFTER: HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGE GENERATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/yingqinghe/scalecrafter?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Researchers studied how to produce high-quality images at large sizes
using pre-trained diffusion models trained on smaller images. They
discovered issues with repeated patterns in the bigger images and
pinpointed the problem to the limited perception of the model's
structures. 

 IMPROVING TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATION WITH LLMS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://minidalle3.github.io/?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Researchers are improving how we communicate with text-to-image
models, like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, which currently require
complex prompts for generating images. They've introduced "interactive
text to image", allowing people to naturally interact with Large
Language Models for better image creation and related tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE BIG AI AND ROBOTICS CONCEPT THAT HAS ATTRACTED BOTH WALMART AND
SOFTBANK (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/07/a-big-ai-and-robotics-idea-that-has-attracted-walmart-and-softbank.html?utm_source=tldrai]


 Symbotic and Softbank have created a joint venture called GreenBox
Systems that promises to deliver AI-powered logistics and warehousing
to small companies. It will provide its services in facilities that
different companies will share. GreenBox aims to help companies that
can't afford the multi-million dollar investments required to build
and operate such facilities in the same way cloud companies make
high-end compute tech accessible. 

 HUGGING FACE MISTRAL MODEL (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha?utm_source=tldrai]


 Trained with direct preference optimization by the Hugging Face team,
this model improves chat performance on a variety of benchmarks. 

 OPENAI IS TOO CHEAP TO BEAT (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/openai-is-too-cheap-to-beat?utm_source=tldrai]


 Open source models are great, but OpenAI‚Äôs ability to serve models
at extreme economies of scale is a likely insurmountable advantage.
