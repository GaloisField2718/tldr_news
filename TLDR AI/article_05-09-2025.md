 BUILDING TRUST IN THE AI BOOM: JOIN THE VIRTUAL EVENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In today's AI boom, shipping fast gets attention—but building trust
gets results. Startups now face higher expectations earlier than ever,
with investors demanding clean financials and enterprise buyers
requiring strong security before deals close.

With the right systems, trust shifts from a checkbox to a growth
engine—and that's where Vanta and Mercury step in, equipping
early-stage teams to build investor and enterprise-grade credibility
without slowing down.

JOIN THE LIVE WEBINAR [4] WITH LEADERS AT VANTA AND MERCURY TO LEARN
LEARN HOW TO:

 	* Pass investor diligence with confidence and fewer follow-ups
 	* Avoid security and procurement blockers before they stall a deal
 	* Stay ahead of compliance and risk without hiring full teams
 	* Demonstrate capital discipline in a market that rewards it

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AI ARTISTS VS. AI ENGINEERS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI Artists give AI systems full creative control, while AI engineers
operate under constraints to optimize for quality. The distinction
between the two is a spectrum, and most people fall somewhere in the
middle, closer to one side or the other. While large language models
are very powerful fools, in the absence of the ability to do
fine-grained learning in the way a human does, they need stricter
guardrails than a truly general-purpose system would ideally want.
Companies should focus on building trust with customers by doing
well-scoped, expected things.

ADOPTION (11 MINUTE READ) [9]

that shape how users experience and begin to trust the agent. This
post walks through the different layers of AI agent architecture to
help readers understand why some agents feel magical while others feel
frustrating. Product managers should architect for the magical
experience.
