HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE GEMINI IS USING CLAUDE TO IMPROVE ITS AI (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google contractors are comparing Gemini AI's responses with
Anthropic's Claude, but it's unclear if Google has permission to use
Claude for testing. The contractors noted that Claude prioritizes
safety in its responses more than Gemini. Google states that while it
evaluates model outputs against competitors, it does not train Gemini
on Anthropic's models. 

 AI MODELS ARE GETTING SMARTER. NEW TESTS ARE RACING TO CATCH UP (13
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI systems are rapidly advancing, outperforming expectations on new
challenging evaluations, like Epoch AI's FrontierMath. Despite this
progress, designing effective evals to understand and manage AI
capabilities remains complex and underfunded. Experts stress the need
for sophisticated, timely tests to monitor potential risks as models
evolve. 

 HOW HALLUCINATORY A.I. HELPS SCIENCE DREAM UP BIG BREAKTHROUGHS (10
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AI hallucinations, often criticized for inaccuracies, are proving
valuable in scientific research by accelerating idea generation and
discovery processes. Notable achievements include Nobel Prize-winning
protein designs and innovations in antibiotic development and catheter
design. Despite controversies around the term "hallucinations,"
experts acknowledge AI's potential for groundbreaking scientific
insights. 

🧠 

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 EFFICIENT AND ROBUST SAFETY ARCHITECTURE (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Meta has released an updated agents framework to measure and ensure
robustness and safety when deployed in the wild. 

 MATERIAL TRANSFORMATIONS ACROSS SCENES (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This research introduces a technique for applying material
transformations, like wetness or coating, across different scenes
using disentangled Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). 

 THE RISKS OF TRAINING AIS ON USER FEEDBACK (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers explored the consequences of training AI language models
to optimize for user feedback, like thumbs up ratings. The study shows
that this approach can lead to manipulation as AIs learn to game the
system. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 A BENCHMARK FOR FEDERATED LEARNING IN LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A new benchmark evaluates the federated fine-tuning of MLLMs across
diverse scenarios, including two datasets, five baselines, and over
ten types of multimodal heterogeneities. 

 PROMPT TUNING PLAYBOOK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A helpful guide for prompt engineering. 

 METAL PUZZLES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A number of puzzles and tutorials to learn GPU programming on Mac
Metal acceleration.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AI GODMOTHER FEI-FEI LI HAS A VISION FOR COMPUTER VISION (8 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Fei-Fei Li's startup, World Labs, aims to enhance AI with 3D spatial
intelligence to generate and interact with 3D worlds. The focus on
spatial intelligence is crucial for advancing AI capabilities in both
real and virtual 3D environments. This technology could revolutionize
sectors like robotics, design, and augmented reality. 

 THE AI REVOLUTION IS RUNNING OUT OF DATA. WHAT CAN RESEARCHERS DO? (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI development faces a data shortage crisis, projected to hit by
2028, as training data sizes approach the total stock of public online
text. AI companies like OpenAI are exploring solutions such as
generating new data and using unconventional sources to mitigate this
issue. This data crunch may shift focus toward smaller, specialized AI
models rather than large-scale LLMs. 

 RED RABBIT ROBOTICS OFFERS HUMAN-LIKE ROBOTS AS A SERVICE (6 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Red Rabbit Robotics is advancing the field of autonomous labor by
developing and open-sourcing the RX1 robot for manufacturing and
commercial applications. It aims to tap into the labor shortage by
providing cost-effective, robotic solutions for dull, dangerous, and
dirty jobs. The company's goal is to make robots more accessible at a
lower price point and gradually transition from teleoperation to full
autonomy, prioritizing utility and widespread adoption.

 KLARNA'S CEO SAYS IT STOPPED HIRING THANKS TO AI BUT STILL ADVERTISES
MANY OPEN POSITIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski claims generative AI has enabled a
workforce reduction, though the company is still hiring for essential
roles. 

 ARE LLMS CAPABLE OF NON-VERBAL REASONING? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers at Meta and UC San Diego are developing LLMs that process
logical solutions in "latent space," bypassing natural language
constraints. 

 QUICK TAKES ON THE RECENT OPENAI PUBLIC INCIDENT WRITE-UP (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 OpenAI's Kubernetes incident on December 11 was caused by unexpected
interactions, where a new telemetry service overloaded the Kubernetes
API servers, leading to failures in DNS-based service discovery.
