 DEEP DIVE: EXPLAINING SDXL LATENT SPACE (22 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 One of the innovations of the original Stable Diffusion model was the
use of a smaller latent space for diffusion. This means the diffusion

representation. This post dives into some ways to interpret that space
for SDXL. 

 EXACT LOOKAHEAD DECODING REDUCES INFERENCE LATENCY 2.3X (14 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 There are many ways to speed up autoregressive language model
inference. One way that people are excited about is using a draft
model. This requires two models but it can be slower. However, by
generating related ngrams from the same model, you can alleviate the
need for a draft model and speed up generation linearly.
