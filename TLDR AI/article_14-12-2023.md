HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 2ND BATCH OF A16Z AI GRANTS ANNOUNCED (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Open source AI grants from a16z have provided money and compute to
groups working at the frontier of open-source AI. The second batch of
grants went out to projects like Axolotl and Lmsys. 

 GOOGLE DEBUTS IMAGEN 2 WITH TEXT AND LOGO GENERATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Google has launched Imagen 2, an enhanced AI image model available to
approved Google Cloud Vertex AI users that offers new capabilities
like text rendering, logos, and multilingual translations. 

 CEREBRAS GIGAGPT (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cerebras makes AI training chips. It has released a framework for
training huge models on its systems. The framework is simple and it
doesn't require splitting up large models across multiple GPUs and
nodes.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 A FIRST LOOK AT GEMINI'S MULTIMODAL ABILITY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gemini does better than many open models in a variety of vision
tasks. It also seems very competitive with GPT-V on the same tasks. 

 EFFICIENT COMPRESSION OF LLMS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This research introduces a method for compressing large language
models using reduced order modeling, significantly reducing memory and
time constraints without needing high-end hardware. 

 ALIGNING EMBEDDINGS FOR DIVERSE TASKS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 FIND introduces a versatile interface for AI models, enabling them to
understand images and datasets better without altering the core model.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 QA WOLF: FINDS YOUR BUGS WITH FULLY AUTOMATED TEST COVERAGE(SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Building automated test coverage in-house takes years to scale. But
manual QA, while more affordable, wastes time and causes bugs to sneak
into production. Consider QA Wolf - they get web apps to 80% coverage
in just 4 months [11]. They build and maintain your test suite in
open-source Playwright and offer unlimited parallel test runs on their
infrastructure. Request a demo (and a few free tests). [11] 

 PHI-2 WEIGHTS AVAILABLE (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Microsoft's newest model is available for research purposes on
HuggingFace. 

 A MORE EFFICIENT LLM TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The HyperRouter method improves the efficiency of large language
model training by dynamically adjusting router parameters. 

 CLIP'S ROLE IN ADVANCING MEDICAL IMAGING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project delves into the application of the CLIP pre-training
paradigm in medical imaging, discussing its adaptation, applications,
and limitations. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of
how CLIP can enhance medical image analysis.

MISCELLANEOUS

 VERTICAL AI (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Horizontal software, software designed to solve a user's pain
regardless of the type of user that feels it, has defined the last 10
years of SaaS. Vertical SaaS, by contrast, is designed for a single or
narrow user set, enabling the solution to be tailored to their needs.
In this article, a Greylock partner forecasts that moving forward,
users‚Äô expectations around tailored services will govern how we
build software. 

 WHY THE AI ACT WAS SO HARD TO PASS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The EU's AI Act, after a lengthy negotiation process and last-minute
debates over facial recognition and foundational AI models, reached a
provisional deal that could set a blueprint for global AI regulation.
The Act, which categorizes AI systems based on risk, includes a
two-tier system for general-purpose AI Systems and provisions for
systems posing an "unacceptable" risk. It faces the challenge of
adapting to rapidly evolving AI technologies. 

 GOOGLE‚ÄôS GEMINI MARKETING TRICK (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Why did Google, arguably the pioneer of all things generative AI,
feel the need to juice its marketing around the launch of Gemini? It
boggles the mind and shows just how much is at stake here in the game
of winner-takes-all in AI.

QUICK LINKS

 GET YOUR DATA LLM-READY (SPONSOR) [18] 

 80% of enterprise data lives in difficult-to-use formats (HTML, PDF,
CSV, PNG, PPTX‚Ä¶). Unstructured‚Äôs software makes this data
available for vector databases and LLMs. Start with open-source or
paid APIs [18] 

 ANYSCALE INTRODUCES JSON MODE AND FUNCTION CALLING FEATURES TO
ANYSCALE ENDPOINTS (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 AI infrastructure company Anyscale has introduced JSON mode and
function calling capabilities to its Anyscale Endpoints service,
significantly enhancing the usability of open models. Developers can
now ensure LLM output consistency with JSON format and tailor them to
specific schema requirements, as well as empower models to use APIs
while choosing the right functions and arguments to call. 

 OPENAI INKS DEAL WITH AXEL SPRINGER ON LICENSING NEWS FOR MODEL
TRAINING (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 OpenAI has reached an agreement with Axel Springer, a Berlin-based
owner of publications including Business Insider and Politico, to
train its generative AI models on the publisher‚Äôs content and add
recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT. 

 SWIFTLY (WEBSITE) [21] 

 Simplify business travel with an AI assistant.
