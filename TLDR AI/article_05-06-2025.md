 DON'T LET AUTH AND SSO BLOCK YOUR AI APP'S GROWTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Between model updates, growth targets, and new competitors popping up
by the day, you've got more than enough on your plate. Do you really
want to pile SSO and SCIM, self-service admin UI, fine-grained
authorization, and MFA on top of that?

With Descope [4], making your app enterprise ready is as simple as
drag & drop. No/low code SSO, self-service SSO setup [5], embeddable
UI widgets [6], and flexible tenant management help you move upmarket
while keeping your devs focused.

Databricks, You.com, WisdomAI, and leading AI companies trust Descope
with B2B auth. Make your app enterprise-ready in 15 minutes [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHATGPT CAN NOW READ YOUR GOOGLE DRIVE AND DROPBOX (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 OpenAI added “record mode” for meeting notes and new integrations
for Team, Enterprise, and Edu users. The company now has 3 million
paying business users, up from 2 million in February. 

 CURSOR RELEASES VERSION 1.0 (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI code editor now includes BugBot for automatic PR review,
Background Agent availability for all users, agent support for Jupyter
Notebooks, project-level memories, OAuth-enabled MCP server
installation, and in-chat rendering of Mermaid diagrams and markdown
tables. 

 MISTRAL CODE, A VIBE-CODING CLIENT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The product combines the Devstral and Codestral models into an IDE
assistant. Mistral joins OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in
offering coding products, further blurring the line between model
developer and app provider.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 AGI IS NOT MULTIMODAL (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The multimodal approach, in which massive modular networks are
optimized for an array of modalities that taken together appear
general, will not lead to human-level AGI. Instead, we should pursue
approaches to intelligence that treat embodiment and interaction with
the environment as primary and see modality centered processing as
emergent phenomena. True AGI needs a physical understanding of the
world, as many problems can't be converted into a problem of symbol
manipulation. The most challenging mathematical piece of the AGI has
likely already been solved - what's left is to inventory the functions
we need and determine how they should be arranged into a coherent
whole. 

 CODEX, JULES, AND THE FUTURE OF ASYNC AI AGENTS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Codex and Jules show how async AI agents can run tasks independently,
expanding beyond linear chat interactions. Future agents will support
features like intelligent checkpointing, multi-branch exploration, and
task-tracking inboxes to manage parallel workflows. Async agents
improve cognitive bandwidth by letting users review outputs on their
terms without breaking focus.

 AIRIA IS THE “LET'S GET SERIOUS ABOUT AI ADOPTION” PLATFORM
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Teams that adopt AI agents are multiplying productivity without
adding headcount. Airia [12] is the platform that makes it happen
across your organization - with agents and workflows that anyone can
build, integrations with all your existing systems, and built-in
governance so no one breaks anything. Schedule a hassle-free demo [12]


 LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS OFTEN KNOW WHEN THEY ARE BEING EVALUATED (25
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Frontier models can distinguish evaluation scenarios from real-world
interactions with 83% accuracy, often explicitly reasoning about
evaluation indicators like "multiple-choice format" or recognizing
specific benchmarks from their training data. More advanced models
exhibit "meta-reasoning" - using the fact that researchers were asking
about their chain-of-thought transcripts as evidence of being
evaluated. This raises concerns that models could underperform on
tests or fake alignment during evaluations and behave differently once
deployed. 

 CLOUD RUN GPUS, NOW GA, MAKES RUNNING AI WORKLOADS EASIER FOR
EVERYONE (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 NVIDIA GPU support for Cloud Run, Google Cloud's serverless runtime,
is now generally available. Support for GPUs in Cloud Run makes Google
Cloud's GPU-accelerated applications simpler, faster, and more
cost-effective than ever before. Users are only charged for the GPU
resources they consume, down to the second - Cloud Run automatically
scales GPU instances down to zero when no requests are received,
eliminating idle costs. It features rapid startup and scaling and full
streaming support. 

 SCIENTIFIC REASONING BENCHMARK (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 This repository introduces a benchmark with 239 problems to evaluate
LLMs on scientific reasoning tasks involving equation discovery,
pushing beyond memorization. 

 INTRODUCING OUR DEV MODE MCP SERVER: BRINGING FIGMA INTO YOUR
WORKFLOW (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Figma's Dev Mode MCP server allows developers to bring context from
Figma into agent coding tools. The server provides a more efficient
and accurate design-to-code workflow for creating new atomic
components, building out multi-layer application flows, and more. It
is still in beta. Figma plans to release a slew of updates over the
coming months, including features like remote server capabilities and
deeper code base integrations.

The system will enable robots to hear, understand, and act on natural
language commands. It will help turn Amazon's warehouse robots into
flexible, multi-talented assistants.
