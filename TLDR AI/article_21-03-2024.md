HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 STABLE DIFFUSION MAKER LEAVES STABILITY AI (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Stability AI's research scientist Robin Rombach, crucial to
developing the Stable Diffusion model, is leaving the company, marking
a significant departure amidst a year of technical team changes. 

 INTRODUCING COPILOT4D: A FOUNDATION MODEL FOR SELF-DRIVING (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Waabi's Copilot4D is a pioneering foundation model that leverages
LiDAR data to understand and predict the 3D dynamics of the
environment over time, advancing the capabilities of autonomous
machines. 

 NLX RAISES $15M SERIES A (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 NLX, an enterprise conversational AI platform, has raised additional
funding from Cercano, Comcast, and others. The platform is used to
build chat, voice, video, and conversational systems.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 DATA AUGMENTATION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DreamDA offers a new approach to data augmentation, utilizing
diffusion models to synthesize diverse, high-quality images that
closely match the original data distribution. 

 VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS WITH INTERACTIVE REASONING (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Chain-of-Spot (CoS) introduces an Interactive Reasoning technique
that significantly enhances how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
process and understand images. By focusing on key regions of interest
within images in response to specific questions or instructions, CoS
enables LVLMs to access detailed visual information without
compromising image resolution. 

 ENHANCING VIRTUAL TRY-ON WITH PRE-TRAINED DIFFUSION MODELS (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 StableVITON is a novel approach to image-based virtual try-on. This
method focuses on maintaining clothing details while leveraging the
generative power of pre-trained diffusion models. StableVITON learns
semantic correspondences between clothes and the human body in a
pre-trained model's latent space.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 PHOSPHO: USE TEXT ANALYTICS TO DETECT ISSUES IN LLM APPS (SPONSOR)
[12] 

 Phospho is an open source text analytics platform [13] for LLM
apps.¬†Easily log user inputs and LLM app outputs to get an overview
of what is happening in real time.¬†Automatically detect and extract
semantic events in each messages.¬†Build automated workflows via
webhooks or API calls when specific events are detected. Self deploy
Phospo in 60 seconds [13] or try Phospo Pro [14] 

 TRITON PUZZLES (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Triton is a library for writing CUDA kernels in a Python-like way. It
is gaining popularity. This repository has a set of puzzles in
increasing difficulty that encourage learning the tool. 

 DIFFUSION-BASED VIDEO TRANSLATION (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 FRESCO is a novel approach that combines intra-frame and inter-frame
correspondences to significantly improve the spatial-temporal
consistency in video translation tasks. 

 ENHANCED IMAGE EDITING WITH CONSISTENCY MODELS (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 This project enhances the capabilities of diffusion models for tasks
like image editing and restoration by introducing Generalized
Consistency Trajectory Models (GCTMs). These models streamline the
process, making it possible to modify images with remarkable precision
and efficiency by translating between any two distributions with just
one step.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEW BREAKTHROUGH BRINGS MATRIX MULTIPLICATION CLOSER TO IDEAL (7
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Tsinghua University and UC Berkeley researchers have achieved a
significant breakthrough in matrix multiplication, presenting an
innovative technique that has already spurred further enhancements.
This advancement in a core computational operation could lead to
substantial time, power, and cost savings across various applications.
This represents the most considerable progress in reducing the
computational complexity of matrix multiplication since the previous
milestone in 2010. 

 STYLIZED IMAGE BINNING ALGORITHM (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This is a tutorial on creating a pixel-art-like image processing tool
with interactive web elements like sliders for customization using a
binning algorithm in JavaScript. The binning technique uses parameters
such as bin size and gap to convert images into stylized, pixelated
artwork by averaging pixel brightness within bins. The implementation
involves manipulating pixel data on HTML canvas elements and
optimizing looping structures for efficiency. 

 USING LLMS TO GENERATE FUZZ GENERATORS (8 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 LLMs like Claude can generate effective fuzzers for parsing code,
automating a process that traditionally requires significant human
effort. While LLMs are typically not precise enough for static
analysis, they appear well-suited for creating fuzzers due to the
stochastic nature of fuzzing. A hybrid approach that combines
LLM-driven static analysis and targeted fuzzing could be promising for
identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in code.
