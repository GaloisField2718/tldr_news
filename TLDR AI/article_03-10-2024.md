 NYLAS EXTRACTAI: TURN USER EMAILS INTO STRUCTURED DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The world (still) runs on email. Invoices, product orders, travel
plans - they're all in the inbox. But unstructured data and wildly
disparate email formats make extracting the parts you need difficult.

ExtractAI by Nylas [4] is the new way to sync, filter, and extract
user data. With just a few lines of code, you can now deploy advanced
ML, NLP, and LLMs to retrieve first-party data from your users'
inboxes [4]:

 	* 92% cost savings compared to other AI / LLM tools
 	* 99.9% accuracy SLA for order data
 	* Real-time sync with no email forwarding required

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S LATEST FUNDING (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has raised $6.6B in new funding at a $157B post-money
valuation to continue scaling AI. Investors include Microsoft and
Nvidia. 

 GOOGLE ADDS A MULTI-FUNCTIONAL QUICK INSERT KEY AND NEW AI FEATURES
TO CHROMEBOOK PLUS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has introduced new Chromebook models from Samsung and Lenovo
featuring AI-powered tools. Key updates include a "Help me read" tool
for summarizing PDFs and web content and live translation for video
calls. Enhanced AI features are also coming to existing Chromebooks,
such as AI writing tools and a built-in speech-to-text recorder. 

 BRAIN-LIKE COMPUTERS TACKLE THE EXTREME EDGE (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BrainChip has announced the Akida Pico, a milliWatt-level
neuromorphic chip designed for AI inference in power-constrained
devices like wearables. The chip mimics brain activity to minimize
energy use, targeting real-time processing needs in small user
devices. Akida Pico joins similar edge-oriented neuromorphic chips
from companies like Innatera and SynSense.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 SCALING OPTIMAL LR ACROSS TOKEN HORIZON (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This paper explores how to scale learning rate when you increase the
amount of training data a model sees. Llama did exponential -0.28 and
this paper suggests exponential -0.33. 

 EMBEDDING KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This paper introduces a new way to approach knowledge graph embedding
by using group theory to incorporate uncertainty. 

 PERSON RE-ID WITH TEXTUAL PROMPTS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This paper presents a new method, Prompt-guided Feature Disentangling
(ProFD), for addressing occlusion issues in person Re-Identification
(ReID) tasks.

 LOCAL FILE ORGANIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This tool uses Llama 3.2 3B and Llava-1.6 to organize your files on
your computer into logical sections based on content. 

 NEW IMAGE RESTORATION ALGORITHM (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) is an innovative algorithm for
photo-realistic image restoration. 

 IMPROVE LLM COLLABORATION (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 RouterDC is a novel method that enhances collaboration between
multiple large language models (LLMs) by using query-based routing. It
employs contrastive learning to select the best model for each query,
improving performance over existing routing methods.

 AI CAN BEST GOOGLE'S BOT DETECTION SYSTEM, SWISS RESEARCHERS FIND (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers from ETH Zurich used AI to achieve a 100% success rate in
solving Google's reCAPTCHA v2. This breakthrough highlights AI's
capability to overcome image-based CAPTCHA systems. As bots become
smarter, CAPTCHA's future as a security technology remains uncertain. 

 NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY FOR AI DEVELOPERS (20 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This article discusses the need for a negligence-based approach to AI
accountability, focusing on the human factors behind AI systems. It
critiques current regulatory frameworks that overlook the role of AI
developers and suggests California's AI safety bill as a potential
model. The article also explores the challenges in defining reasonable
care in AI and the implications of treating AI developers as
professionals. 

 I AM TIRED OF AI (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This author expresses frustration with the overuse and marketing of
AI, particularly in software testing and conference proposals. They
argue AI tools often prioritize speed over quality and lack the unique
insight of human-generated work. Despite recognizing some beneficial
uses, they criticize the proliferation of mediocre AI-generated
content.
