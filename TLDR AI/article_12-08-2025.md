 WHAT MAKES AI AGENTS SUCCESSFUL? QUERY CLASSES, LLM JUDGES, AND MORE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Glean's AI agents do serious work at Booking.com, Duolingo,
Databricks, and other major enterprises. Download this technical
whitepaper [4] for an inside look at the technical differentiators
that distinguish agents built on Glean's Work AI platform, including:

 	* PERSONALIZATION: Tailor the agent experience by searching across a
library of “golden” workflows.
 	* QUERY CLASSES: Design common enterprise query types [4] — like
data analysis (“find all Jira tickets assigned to me”), progress
summarization (“what have I worked on this week?”), and request
handling (“request a new laptop”).
 	* LLM JUDGES: Evaluate agent performance at scale using
task-specific LLM judges and real-world eval sets for each query
class.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 OPENAI'S REASONING SYSTEM WINS GOLD AT INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIAD IN
INFORMATICS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI's reasoning models placed first among AI participants and
outperformed 325 of 330 human competitors at the prestigious
programming olympiad. The system operated under identical constraints
as the humans and used general-purpose models without
competition-specific training. It jumped from last year's near-bronze
to 98th percentile performance. 

 NVIDIA'S PUSH ON PHYSICAL AI (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NVIDIA unveiled innovations in neural rendering, 3D generation,
simulation, and reasoning models for physical AI at SIGGRAPH 2025.
Highlights included new Omniverse NuRec libraries for large-scale
reconstruction, Cosmos Reason VLM for physics-aware reasoning, and
updates to the Metropolis vision AI platform. 

 ANTHROPIC'S CLAUDE CHATBOT CAN NOW REMEMBER YOUR PAST CONVERSATIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic released a memory function for its Claude chatbot that
allows users to recall past conversations on demand. The feature
supports web, desktop, and mobile, and is currently available to Max,
Team, and Enterprise subscribers. Unlike OpenAI's ChatGPT, Claude
doesn't build a user profile and retrieves past chats only when
requested.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 GPT-5S ARE ALIVE: BASIC FACTS, BENCHMARKS, AND THE MODEL CARD (30
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OpenAI released several good models at once: GPT-5, GPT-5-Thinking,
GPT-5-With-The-Router, GPT-5-Pro, and GPT-5-API. These models cut down
on errors and hallucinations and are easier to use. This post provides
an introduction to these models, including basic facts, benchmarks,
and the model card. GPT-5-Thinking and GPT-5-Pro look like substantial
upgrades to o3 and o3-Pro. 

 DEEPMIND CEO ON WORLD MODELS AND AI BENCHMARKS (31 MINUTE VIDEO) [9] 

 Demis Hassabis discusses advances like Genie 3's world model
capabilities, the Deep Think features in Gemini 2.5, and Kaggle's Game
Arena as tools for pushing AI systems closer to AGI-level reasoning
and understanding. 

 HOW MUCH POWER WILL FRONTIER AI TRAINING DEMAND IN 2030? (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Epoch AI estimates the largest AI training runs will require 4-16
gigawatts by 2030, enough to power millions of homes, if current
trends hold. US AI data center capacity would need to increase 10x
over the next 5 years to 50 gigawatts to support this scale, roughly
5% of the nation's total power generation.

 YOUR AI TOOLS WORK GREAT IN ISOLATION. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Companies have LLM subscriptions, automated workflows, and AI agents
— but they're all running in silos. The real competitive advantage
isn't having AI tools, it's orchestrating them into cohesive
processes. Camunda's ultimate guide [11] will help you turn
disconnected AI experiments into integrated operations. Get your copy

 AN ESSENTIAL PRIMER FOR BUILDING ENTERPRISE-READY MCP SERVERS (10
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 MCP doesn't require compromising security - it enables security to be
applied intelligently so that teams can embrace AI safely,
confidentially, and without unnecessary barriers. Overly restrictive
access slows innovation, frustrates developers, and prevents teams
from realizing the full potential of MCP-based integrations.
Organizations should already have guardrails proven to protect
critical systems - they should have faith in those foundations. 

 FORWARD DEPLOYED AI RESEARCH (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Forward Deployed Research is the discipline of living with a problem,
building just enough to learn, throwing it into the wild, and pulling
the feedback directly into the next version. It is where the real
progress in AI is happening now: the people pushing the boundaries
refuse to accept the traditional divide between research and
deployment. AI may cause the distinction between scientist and
engineer to blur. 

 LANGDIFF (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Modern AI applications increasingly rely on LLMs to generate
structured data, but streaming these outputs poses unique challenges.
LangDiff is a Python library that helps stream structured LLM outputs
to frontends. It can be used to build responsive AI applications where
the backend structures and frontend experiences can evolve
independently. 

 PHYSICALLY CONTROLLABLE RELIGHTING OF PHOTOGRAPHS (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 This study presents a self-supervised approach to in-the-wild image
relighting that enables fully controllable, physically based
illumination editing. The approach combines the physical accuracy of
traditional rendering with the photorealistic appearance made possible
by neural rendering. It represents a significant step in bringing the
explicit physical control over lights available in typical 3D computer
graphics tools to in-the-wild relighting. A 5-minute-long video
explaining the study with examples is available.

 HOW BENCHMAXXED IS GPT-OSS-120B? (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An analysis of currently available cutting-edge open source models
found that gpt-oss-120b scored the worst on LiveBench, a private
benchmark that uses secret questions. While the model looked good on
release day, a bunch of critical reports have since been released.
This isn't conclusive evidence that OpenAI is gaming benchmarks, but
it brings up the question of whether it is worth creating
meta-benchmarks that try to measure overfitting in more robust ways. 

 ELON MUSK'S XAI RELEASES GROK 4 FOR FREE GLOBALLY, CHALLENGES
OPENAI'S GPT-5 LAUNCH (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 xAI's Grok 4 is now freely accessible to all users worldwide. Free
users have generous usage limits for a limited time. Grok 4 features
an Auto Mode, where the AI decides if a user prompt requires deeper
reasoning or a simple response, and an Expert Mode, which allows users
to manually trigger more in-depth answers. Access to Grok 4 Heavy
remains exclusive to SuperGrok Heavy subscribers.

 HERE IS HOW OPENAI WILL PRIORITIZE COMPUTE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
MONTHS (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get
more total usage than they did before GPT-5, then it will prioritize
API demand up to the allocated capacity and commitments it has made to
customers, increase the quality of the free tier of ChatGPT, and
prioritize new API demand. 

 BILLIONS FLOW TO NEW HEDGE FUNDS FOCUSED ON AI-RELATED BETS (7 MINUTE

 AI-focused investors argue the long-term trend of development and
adoption are inevitable. 

 ON PRICING (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 OpenAI may have erased a bunch of market cap by pricing ChatGPT at
$20.
