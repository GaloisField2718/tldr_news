 BLUEOCEANAI REVOLUTIONIZING MARKETING WITH AI AGENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In a new AWS case study, BLUEOCEANAI [5] shows how it's doing what
dashboards and legacy analytics never could, turning billions of
marketing signals into real-time strategy.

Built on AMAZON BEDROCK and powered by CLAUDE 3, their Spark™
platform helps companies like AWS, SAP, AND INTEL move from “What
happened?” to “What should we do next?”, fast.

 	* 97% faster execution
 	* 96% lower analytics costs
 	* 4x faster marketing payback

It's a multi-agentic framework [6] trained on proprietary brand data,
generating competitive insights, content plans, and messaging strategy
on demand.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 GOOGLE RELEASES GEMINI 2.5 DEEP THINK FOR AI ULTRA SUBSCRIBERS (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google's most powerful AI model generates multiple solution
approaches simultaneously before selecting the best answer. A
specialized version that can work for hours on complex problems
recently achieved IMO gold medal status and is being shared with
select mathematicians. 

 ANTHROPIC CUTS OFF OPENAI'S ACCESS TO ITS CLAUDE MODELS (1 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Anthropic revoked OpenAI's access after discovering the company was
using Claude for internal benchmarking and coding assistance ahead of
GPT-5's launch, violating terms that forbid using its AI to create and
improve competitor models. OpenAI will retain access for safety
evaluations and research collaboration on harmful capabilities
testing. 

 OPENAI RAISES $8.3 BILLION AS PAID CHATGPT BUSINESS USERS REACH 5
MILLION (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The round was part of the broader $40 billion fundraise and completed
ahead of schedule, driven by OpenAI's annual recurring revenue jumping
from $10 billion to $13 billion since June and projected to hit $20
billion by year-end. Dragoneer led with a $2.8 billion investment, 10%
of its entire fund.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 WILL DATA CENTERS CRASH THE ECONOMY? (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Big Tech's $102.5 billion quarterly AI spending now exceeds dot-com
era investment as a share of GDP, but the real risk lies in financing
through "private credit" funds that operate outside traditional
banking oversight. Banks have increased their exposure to these shadow
lenders 14x since 2013, creating conditions where a synchronized AI
market downturn could trigger defaults on data centers, cascading
through private credit funds to their bank and insurance company
lenders. 

 TOKENS ARE GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Models will always be cheaper next year, but users will expect more
of them. The goalpost is always moving ahead. Even Anthropic, which
has the most vertically integrated application layer on the planet,
can't make a flat subscription with unlimited usage work. Companies
without a plan are headed to the graveyard fast, as there are no
investors writing checks for negative margin businesses. There's no
figuring it out later when your AWS bill is larger than your revenue. 

 ANDREW NG ON CHINA'S AI MOMENTUM (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In a detailed thread, Andrew Ng argued that China's open-model
ecosystem, rapid semiconductor advances, and aggressive business
dynamics give it a credible path to surpass the U.S. in AI.

 DOES THE BITTER LESSON HAVE LIMITS? (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most
effective by a large margin. The eventual success of approaches based
on scaling computation is often tinged with bitterness because it is
success over a favored, human-centric approach. Developers need to be
aware that their work might be overtaken by compute, but this
shouldn't stop them from applying custom, human-crafted logic to get
the job done. 

 PERSONA VECTORS: MONITORING AND CONTROLLING CHARACTER TRAITS IN
LANGUAGE MODELS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers extracted "persona vectors" by comparing neural network
activity when models exhibit specific traits versus when they don't,
revealing that personality changes follow predictable mathematical
patterns. This discovery enables a counterintuitive "vaccination"
approach that purposefully steers models toward undesirable traits
during training to compensate for their tendency to “overfit” to
negative traits. 

 COHERE'S COMMAND A VISION (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cohere has launched Command A Vision, an open-weight 111B parameter
vision-language model designed for business use cases. It reportedly
surpasses GPT-4.1 and Llama 4 Maverick on enterprise benchmarks. 

 SEED-PROVER: DEEP AND BROAD REASONING FOR AUTOMATED THEOREM PROVING
(18 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 ByteDance's Seed-Prover proved 5 of 6 problems at IMO 2025, the third
AI system to do so, and the first Chinese model, in recent weeks. The
system combines "lemma-style" whole-proof reasoning that breaks
problems into modular components with three-tiered inference
strategies from quick refinements to days-long reasoning that
accumulates thousands of mathematical facts.

 HOW WINDSURF'S FOUNDERS GOT PAID FROM THE GOOGLE DEAL (5 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 New details show Google's $2.4B licensing deal with Windsurf split
evenly between investors and compensation for 40 employees hired by
Google, including co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen. 

 AI'S OVERLOOKED $97 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY (4 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter.
Americans enjoyed roughly $97 billion in consumer surplus (the
difference between the maximum a consumer is willing to pay for a good
or service and its actual price) from generative AI tools in 2024.
Around 40% of US adults are regular users of generative AI. As more
digital goods become available for free, measuring benefits as well as
costs will become increasingly important.
