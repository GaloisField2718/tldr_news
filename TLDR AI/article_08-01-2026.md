DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 8 PLOTS THAT EXPLAIN THE STATE OF OPEN MODELS (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chinese companies are making strong, open AI models that are applying
increasing pressure on the US AI economy. Dethroning Qwen in adoption
in 2026 looks impossible, but there are areas of opportunity. The US
could very well have the smartest open models again in 2026, even if
they're used far less across the ecosystem. This post contains 8 plots
that show the impact of Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, GPT-OSS, Nemotron, and
other new entrants to the ecosystem. 

 CONTEXT IS THE NEXT DATA PLATFORM—AND WHY CONTEXT GRAPHS ARE KEY TO
UNDERSTANDING PROCESSES (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Context graphs shed light on how work really gets done in the
enterprise. AI agents are a major unlock with automation, but only if
their reasoning is grounded in the right enterprise context. It's not
enough to just understand the enterprise data, systems also need
relationship knowledge. Context graphs enable agents to learn and
automate distributed work by capturing processes and learning intent
over time. 

 RECURSIVE LANGUAGE MODELS AND CONTEXT FOLDING (28 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Recursive Language Model (RLM) is a flexible solution to long-context
limitations in LLM agents. RLMs avoid summarization by delegating
memory management to scripts and sub-models.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 ARE AI TOOLS FOCUSING TOO MUCH ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY? (SPONSOR)
[10] 

 Most companies aren't getting the AI results they want. This
Forrester study [11] shows how an overemphasis on individual
productivity, instead of collaboration, could be the culprit. For a
look at how collaboration-first AI lives up to the hype, join the Miro
webinar on January 22nd. Register now. [10] 

 FINEPDFS: LIBERATING 3T OF THE FINEST TOKENS FROM PDFS (52 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 PDFs have been largely ignored by the open source AI community,
despite being a source of high-quality data for pretraining. Hugging
Face has created a new pretraining dataset of more than 3T tokens
spanning over 1,000 languages extracted from PDFs. This post details
how the dataset was created. 

 OPEN GAMING FOUNDATION MODEL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 NitroGen is a generalist gaming agent trained on internet gameplay
videos capable of predicting controller actions from pixels and
adapting to unseen games through post-training. 

 VISUAL WEB AGENTS (29 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 WebGym is a large-scale environment with nearly 300,000 real-world
web tasks for training visual agents. It has a high-throughput RL
system that boosts training speed and a fine-tuned Qwen-3-VL that
outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking on unseen web navigation tasks.

 CONSUMER AI PREDICTIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Screenless and always-on AI devices will fail, while mini-apps enable
UGC personal software and a US consumer super-app. By 2030, consumer
AI will split into a reliable task assistant and an AI companion,
performance marketing will collapse, and AI-generated virtual creators
will explode. The biggest win will go to whoever solves AI discovery
beyond chat and search. 

 BRENDAN FOODY ON TEACHING AI AND THE FUTURE OF KNOWLEDGE WORK (56
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Brendan Foody, the youngest unicorn founder and CEO of Mercor, is
transforming AI training by hiring experts like poets and economists
to create evaluation frameworks for frontier models. Mercor pays top
talent to teach AI models that are rapidly improving in economically
valuable tasks.
