HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 MISTRAL AND NVIDIA'S NEW MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Mistral Nemo 12B is a multilingual model trained with a new tokenizer
that shows powerful multilingual and English performance. It supports
128k contexts too. 

 GPT-4O MINI (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 GPT-4o Mini is a new, smaller, model from OpenAI aimed to replace
GPT-3.5. It scores 82 on MMLU, which is reasonable for cheap models. 

 COHERE AND FUJITSU STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cohere and Fujitsu announced a strategic partnership to develop and
provide enterprise AI services with industry-leading Japanese language
capabilities. These services will be created with security and data
privacy at the core, offering private cloud deployments to serve
organizations in highly-regulated industries including financial
institutions, the public sector, and R&D units.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 LEAPFROGGING TRADITIONAL VECTOR-BASED RAG WITH LANGUAGE MAPS (12
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Retrieval is a huge part of building a chat application over data.
However, systems are often sensitive to the format of things being
retrieved. Building a language map (e.g., Wikipedia style entry) of
the content, and using that for retrieval dramatically improves
chat-based performance. Mutable AI does this for code base question
answering. 

 PATCH-LEVEL TRAINING TECHNIQUE ENHANCES EFFICIENCY OF LLMS (16 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Researchers propose patch-level training for large language models to
improve training efficiency. 

 REMOVING INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT FROM DIFFUSION MODELS (24 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Reliable and Efficient Concept Erasure (RECE) is a novel method that
erases inappropriate content from diffusion models in just 3 seconds
without needing extra fine-tuning.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 AS YOU READ THIS, DATA BROKERS ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO
SCAMMERS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Do you get a lot of suspicious texts, calls, and emails?

That's because data brokers sell our contact details, DOBs, SSNs, and
more, to the highest bidders - every day. The good news? Incogni [12]
confronts brokers on your behalf, preventing bad actors from accessing
your data.

3 minute setup, 180+ data brokers tackled. 60% discount with code

 LLM2SH (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LLM2sh is a command-line utility that leverages LLMs to translate
plain-language requests into shell commands. 

 SYMBOLIC MUSIC TASKS WITH GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 GraphMuse is a new framework designed to enhance the use of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) in symbolic music tasks. 

 UNIVERSAL MULTIMODAL EMBEDDINGS WITH LLMS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 E5-V is a new framework that adapts Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to create universal multimodal embeddings. It bridges the gap
between different input types using prompts, achieving impressive
performance in multimodal tasks without fine-tuning.

MISCELLANEOUS

 STRATEGIZING YOUR PREPARATION FOR MACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEWS (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Machine Learning interviews can be challenging. Understanding the
spectrum of ML roles and tailoring your preparation to specific job
responsibilities and specializations can significantly improve your
chances. Focus on mastering fundamentals, researching company-specific
technologies, and consistently tracking your progress to confidently
tackle interviews. 

 UNCENSOR ANY LLM WITH ABLITERATION (13 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Llama models are heavily censored for safety, limiting flexibility.
The "abliteration" technique uncensors them by identifying and
removing the refusal mechanism, allowing models to respond to all
prompts without retraining. 

 QUESTION-ANSWERING FOR SCIENTIFIC PAPERS (14 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 SPIQA is a QA dataset designed to help readers quickly find answers
in scientific research articles by interpreting complex figures and
tables.

MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Broadcom has had discussions with OpenAI about building a new
artificial intelligence server chip. 

 OVERCOMING THE LIMITS OF CURRENT LLMS (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Large language models face challenges such as hallucinations, lack of
confidence estimates, and lack of citations. 

 FLOW STUDIO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [21] 

 Flow Studio generates fully-produced, film-quality 3-minute-long
videos with engaging plots, consistent characters, and automatically
matched background music and sound effects.
