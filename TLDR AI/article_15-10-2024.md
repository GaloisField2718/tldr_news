HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 ADOBE ANNOUNCED VIDEO MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Adobe announced the expansion of its Firefly family of creative
generative AI models to video during the Adobe MAX conference. 

 OPENAI APPOINTS INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION BOSS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has appointed Oliver Jay to lead international expansion,
focusing on AI strategy and operations. The company announced a new
APAC office in Singapore and is developing local language datasets.
The o1 model, which utilizes "chain of thought" techniques, is aimed
at enhancing AI accuracy. 

 MICROSOFT MAY HAVE AN AUDIO-TO-IMAGE GENERATOR IN THE WORKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Microsoft has filed a patent for an AI system that converts live
audio into images using LLMs. The system aims to enhance communication
by generating real-time images from audio streams. If developed, it
could be integrated into Microsoft Teams via Copilot.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

 10B DISTRIBUTED TRAINING RUN (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Decentralized training of language models is the process of using
heterogeneous and non-co-located hardware to train a single model.
This is traditionally challenging due to the high cost of memory
transfers. This work improves on the state-of-the-art algorithms for
highly distributed training. 

 VISION-LANGUAGE SEGMENTATION (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 OneRef introduces a streamlined framework for referring segmentation
by unifying visual and language feature spaces into a single
transformer. 

 MOTION PREDICTION WITH SMARTPRETRAIN (19 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 SmartPretrain introduces a flexible, model-agnostic, and
dataset-agnostic self-supervised learning framework for improving
motion prediction in autonomous vehicles. 

🧑‍💻 

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

 UVA - AN INTRODUCTION TO GROUP EQUIVARIANT DEEP LEARNING (18 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Study resources for learning more about deep learning techniques over
certain types of geometric data in the face of architectural
constraints. 

 DIFFUSION MODEL SIMULATING CS:GO (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 An open replication of a diffusion model that simulates the visuals
of a video game while taking keyboard and mouse controls as input. 

 IMPROVING LLM PREFERENCE ALIGNMENT WITH REWARD-AWARE LEARNING (GITHUB
REPO) [12] 

 This study tackles the limitations of current alignment algorithms in
LLMs, which often overfit to relative preferences and overlook the
quality of responses. By introducing reward-conditioned LLM policies,
the authors propose a novel data relabeling technique that factors in
response quality, helping the model generalize to optimal responses.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ANTHROPIC CHALLENGES OPENAI WITH AFFORDABLE BATCH PROCESSING (4
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Anthropic launched a Message Batches API that allows businesses to
process large data volumes at half the cost of standard API calls. The
API supports up to 10,000 asynchronous queries within 24 hours,
offering a cost-effective option that shifts AI processing from
real-time to "right-time." This move promotes AI adoption among
mid-sized businesses, though it risks diverting focus from advancing
real-time AI capabilities. 

 AL WILL TAKE OVER HUMAN SYSTEMS FROM WITHIN (37 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In this post, Yuval Noah Harari, an Israeli historian and the author
of “Sapiens,” “Homo Deus,” and “Nexus,” discusses the role
of information networks and AI in shaping narratives that can unify or
divide societies. He warns that AI, acting as an "alien intelligence,"
may centralize power and that it lacks self-correcting mechanisms,
posing risks to democratic structures. Harari emphasizes the need for
strong institutions to manage truth in a landscape dominated by
powerful AI systems that influence decision-making across various
sectors. 

 STICKY HUMANS IN A POST-AGI WORLD (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AI tutors face significant challenges in replicating the social and
intellectual engagement provided by human teachers. Despite
advancements, AI struggles with nuanced educational tasks and lacks
the ability to provide the socio-intellectual experiences that humans
offer. A hybrid approach, where AI augments rather than replaces human
educators, may be more effective due to the inherent social and
cultural components of learning.
