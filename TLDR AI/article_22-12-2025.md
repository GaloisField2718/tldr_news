 RETROFITTING LEGACY SYSTEMS FOR AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many financial systems of record (like ERP) were built at a time when
AI tools were the stuff of science fiction. Now, they need to work
together.

On the latest episode of Unpack Pricing [4], Metronome CEO Scott Woody
talks with Rillet CEO Nicolas Kopp about why old financial systems
often have a "garbage in, garbage out" problem for modern companies
running AI.

They get into why gen AI is famously bad with numbers [4](and where it
actually helps), why 20 years of finance experience might now be a
hiring red flag, and how one customer went from six-month pricing
changes to two-hour launches.

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 CHATGPT ADDS TONE PERSONALIZATION (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 OpenAI has introduced new personalization options in ChatGPT, letting
users adjust enthusiasm, warmth, and emoji use directly. These
controls, available in the Personalization menu, offer "More," "Less,"
or "Default" settings, expanding tone customization beyond the
existing base style and tone feature. 

 CURSOR ACQUIRES GRAPHITE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cursor has acquired Graphite, a company known for its
performance-focused internal developer portal. This marks Cursor's
third acquisition as it aims to build a comprehensive AI-powered dev
platform. 

 INTRODUCING BLOOM: AN OPEN SOURCE TOOL FOR AUTOMATED BEHAVIORAL
EVALUATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anthropic's Bloom is an open-source tool for generating automated
behavioral evaluations of AI models. Bloom assesses specific behaviors
like self-preferential bias and sabotage by creating scenarios and
quantifying behavior occurrence across models. It efficiently
differentiates between aligned and misaligned models and correlates
strongly with human judgment, enabling scalable and reliable behavior
evaluations.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 THE CHANGING DRIVERS OF LLM ADOPTION (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LLM use is rising. People are increasingly using different LLMs,
different products, and in different places. ChatGPT remains dominant
and keeps acquiring new users, but Gemini's growth has been faster
over the last few months. OpenAI's revenue seems to be on track, but
consumer revenue is likely decreasing as a share. A substantial share
of workplace AI use involves workers adopting tools on their own
rather than waiting for employer-provided access. 

 EVALUATING CONTEXT COMPRESSION FOR AI AGENTS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 What happens when agents run out of memory determines whether they
continue productively or have to start from scratch. This post
explores an evaluation framework that measures how much context
different compression strategies preserve. Structured summarization
retains more useful information than alternative methods without
sacrificing compression efficiency. 

 UNDERSTANDING AI BENCHMARKS (25 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Benchmarks are the most widely misunderstood part of the AI
ecosystem. The narrative keeps implying a universal increase in
intelligence, but the numbers can be misleading. To navigate this
noise, look at the aggregate, look at the relative, and verify with
your own tasks. The only benchmark that matters at the end of the day
is your own workload. 

 EXPERIMENT DIARY (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This document contains a diary for an experiment aimed at teaching an
LLM using GRPO to generate regex given a description. It details the
performance, learnings, modifications, and key takeaways from each
experiment. The initial training run was on December 17. It saw the
model quickly learning how to generate valid regex tags, but the model
was basically generating random regex strings. 

 ANDREJ KARPATHY'S 2025 LLM YEAR IN REVIEW (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Andrej Karpathy has outlined paradigm shifts of LLMs in 2025,
including fast inference engines, model distillation trends, real-time
agents, neural GPUs, and the rise of high-quality open models like
DeepSeek-V2 and RWKV.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 COULD PUBLIC AI TOOLS BE LEAKING YOUR SENSITIVE DATA? (SPONSOR) [13] 

 One in three employees uses AI tools without approval, risking data
leaks and compliance violations. With this Enterprise AI Governance
Kit [13] from You.com [13], you will get ready-to-use templates to
help protect your organization, including security checklists, usage
policies, and governance frameworks.

Download the kit. [13]

 QWEN-IMAGE-LAYERED (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Qwen-Image-Layered is a model capable of decomposing an image into
multiple RGBA layers. Each layer can be independently manipulated
without affecting other content. They can be resized, repositioned,
and recolored. The approach enables high-fidelity and consistent
editing. 

 INTRODUCING MIMO-V2-FLASH (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 MiMo-V2-Flash is a powerful, efficient, and ultra-fast foundational
language model that excels in reasoning, coding, and agentic
scenarios. It serves as an excellent general-purpose assistant for
everyday tasks. The model is available globally on Hugging Face, AI
Studio, and Xiaomi's API platform. Benchmark results are available in
the article. 

 JAX-JS (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 jax-js is a machine learning framework for the browser. It brings
JAX-style, high-performance CPU and GPU kernels to JavaScript, so
users can run numerical applications on the web. The library is
written from scratch and has no external dependencies. It can run
anywhere a browser can run. 

 MULTIPLEXING MCP SERVERS FOR AGENTIC SPECIALIZATION (8 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 MCP servers give agents the tools they need to accomplish tasks. This
post discusses how to multiplex MCP servers to simplify the connection
to various tools within them. Multiplexing allows multiple MCP servers
to be used over a gateway in a single interaction. It allows agents to
access multiple MCP servers with different stacks, clouds,
applications, and frameworks for specialized tasks. 

 TCGEN05 FOR DUMMIES (70 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 tcgen05 is the set of PTX instructions that programs Tensor Cores on
the latest NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs. This post contains a tutorial for
Blackwell in plain CUDA C++ with PTX. It documents the author's
process of learning tcgen05 and reaching 98% of CuBLAS speed. Readers
can follow the tutorial using Modal or any other B200 cloud providers.

 HOW TO GAME THE METR PLOT (9 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 METR topics are public, making it easy to game METR horizon length
measurements for a frontier lab. The horizon length under METR's
assumptions might be adding little information beyond benchmark
accuracy. There is a meme going around based on a team achieving a one
to four hour range on the METR plot. This post explains why the plot
has been interpreted incorrectly. 

 THE SHAPE OF AI: JAGGEDNESS, BOTTLENECKS, AND SALIENTS (11 MINUTE
READ) [20] 

 AI is incredibly good at some tasks while being really bad at others.
This is the 'Jagged Frontier' of AI ability. The jaggedness is likely
going to remain a big part of AIs going forward. However, the growing
frontier will outpace jaggedness.
