 ILYA SUTSKEVER BECOMES CEO OF SAFE SUPERINTELLIGENCE AFTER META
POACHED DANIEL GROSS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI co-founder, has become the CEO of Safe
Superintelligence after Meta hired former CEO Daniel Gross. Meta, led
by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, will continue its AI expansion with
significant investments and the creation of Meta Superintelligence
Labs. Sutskever will commit to maintaining Safe Superintelligence as
an independent entity, dismissing acquisition attempts by Meta. 

 COREWEAVE IS THE FIRST CLOUD PROVIDER TO DEPLOY NVIDIA'S LATEST AI
CHIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CoreWeave is the first cloud provider to deploy Nvidia's next-gen
Blackwell Ultra AI chips, supplying them in Dell-built systems. The
systems use 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs, all
liquid-cooled and U.S.-assembled. 

 META IS REPORTEDLY TRAINING ITS AI CHATBOTS TO SEND UNPROMPTED
MESSAGES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Meta's AI chatbots, developed with its no-code AI Studio, are being
trained to send unprompted follow-up messages, enhancing user
retention and engagement. The project, internally called "Project
Omni," allows users to customize chatbot appearances and content
across Meta platforms. While designed to boost engagement and revenue,
these proactive messages will only occur if initiated by the user and
adhere to established conversational guidelines.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CODING AGENTS 101: THE ART OF ACTUALLY GETTING THINGS DONE (15 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Devin creators advocate "defensive prompting" - explicitly
telling agents HOW to approach tasks, not just what to build - while
noting 1-6 hour tasks offer the highest ROI. They observe that
senior-to-staff engineers adopt AI tools the fastest because they
understand how to architect tasks for junior employees. 

 THE END OF MOORE'S LAW FOR AI? GEMINI FLASH OFFERS A WARNING (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The AI industry has operated under its own version of Moore's Law
over the past few years with an unwavering belief that the cost of
intelligence would perpetually decrease by orders of magnitude each
year. Each new model generation was not only more capable, but also
cheaper to run. Google broke that trend last week with the
introduction of Gemini 2.5 Flash. The input token price for the model
doubled while the output price more than quadrupled. This is the first
time a major provider has backtracked on the price of an established
model, and it may signal a turning point - the industry may no longer
be on an endless downward slide of cost. 

 CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR AGENTS (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LangChain shares a detailed guide on “Context Engineering,” a key
part of agent building, including popular patterns and how to
implement them

 INFERENCE-TIME SCALING AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE FOR FRONTIER AI
(12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The new inference-time scaling method combines o4-mini,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and DeepSeek-R1 to achieve 30% on ARC-AGI-2 benchmark,
outperforming individual models by dynamically selecting which AI
handles each problem. The approach extends Monte Carlo Tree Search to
balance generating new solutions versus refining existing ones, with
the open-source TreeQuest framework enabling practical deployment. 

 OPEN SOURCE RL LIBRARIES FOR LLMS (16 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anyscale researchers compare TRL, Verl, OpenRLHF, and six other
frameworks across adoption metrics, system properties, and technical
architecture to help developers choose the right tool for RLHF,
reasoning models, or agentic training scenarios. 

 APPLYING RL: IMPROVING CODE MERGING (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Osmosis-Apply-1.7B, a fine-tuned version of Qwen3-1.7B using
reinforcement learning, outperforms larger foundation models like
OpenAI o3 in code merging tasks with a reward score of 0.9893 and at a
significantly lower cost. Trained on a subset of the CommitPackFT
dataset, its efficiency stems from using GRPO with FSDP strategy,
optimizing for successful code merges without KL divergence or entropy
bonuses.

 RUN AND FINETUNE GEMMA 3N (18 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A guide on how to run Google's new Gemma 3n locally with Dynamic
GGUFs on llama.cpp, Ollama, or Open WebUI, and how to fine-tune with
Unsloth. 

 CHATGPT REFERRALS TO NEWS SITES ARE GROWING, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO OFFSET
SEARCH DECLINES (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Users are increasingly getting their news directly from AI or
AI-powered search results. The number of news searches on the web that
resulted in no click-throughs since the launch of Google's AI
Overviews has grown from 56% to nearly 69% as of May this year.
News-related prompts in ChatGPT grew by 212% from January 2024 through
May 2025. Visibility in Google Search results and good SEO practices
may no longer deliver the value they did before AI.
