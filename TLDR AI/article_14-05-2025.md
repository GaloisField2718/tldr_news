HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TIKTOK AI ALIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 TikTok has launched AI Alive, a new feature that animates static
images within Stories. It uses intelligent editing tools to turn
photos into short-form videos with dynamic effects. 

 AUDIBLE IS EXPANDING ITS AI-NARRATED AUDIOBOOK LIBRARY (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Amazon's audiobook service, Audible, is partnering with publishers to
expand its catalog with AI-narrated audiobooks, offering over 100
voices in English, Spanish, French, and Italian. Spotify made similar
updates earlier in the year in partnership with ElevenLabs. 

 TENCENT HIRES WIZARDLM TEAM, A MICROSOFT AI GROUP WITH AN ODD HISTORY
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WizardLM, a former Microsoft AI group, has joined Tencent's AI
division, Hunyuan. It quickly released a new AI model, Hunyuan-TurboS
0416, claiming it outperforms Google's offerings. WizardLM will
continue to develop AI models at Tencent.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 CHATGPT IS USED FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN COUNTRIES WHERE IT'S
PROHIBITED (12 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Using a classifier that detects distinctive AI word choices (like
"delve") in academic papers, researchers found ChatGPT usage was
higher in countries where it's prohibited by OpenAI. 22% of Chinese
academic preprints included AI-generated content versus 11% from
legal-access countries by August 2023, suggesting geographic
restrictions can be easily circumnavigated. While ChatGPT use
correlated with increased views and downloads, it showed no impact on
citations or journal placements. 

 5 MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH TODAY'S CONVERSATIONAL AI INTERFACES (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 While chat interfaces provide an accessible medium to LLMs for
first-time users, they're a design dead-end that forces users to
accommodate to the model rather than the reverse. The next generation
of assistants will use more adaptive UIs and proactively communicate
their capabilities. 

 DUOLINGO'S PUSH TO BE AN AI-FIRST COMPANY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Duolingo announced a major shift to become an AI-first company,
integrating AI tools across products and workflows. The company's new
tenets include starting every task with AI, dedicating time for
learning, careful experimentation, and preserving technical
excellence. Leadership emphasized that while AI raises expectations,
it's about working smarter, not harder.

ENGINEERING & RESEARCH

 SAKANA AI UNVEILS "CONTINUOUS THOUGHT MACHINE" WITH BRAIN-INSPIRED
NEURAL TIMING (22 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Japanese AI company Sakana developed a new type of AI model that
allows individual neurons to remember their previous actions and
coordinate their activity based on timing patterns. While it
underperforms compared to traditional models, it does allow
researchers to understand how the model reasons, and similar to recent
reasoning models like o3, its answers improve when given more time to
“think”. 

 VISUAL AUTOREGRESSION WITHOUT QUANTIZATION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 EAR introduces a continuous visual autoregressive generation method
that avoids quantization by leveraging strictly proper scoring rules
like the energy score. This enables direct generation in continuous
data spaces without probabilistic modeling. 

 UNIFIED TRAINING AND SAMPLING FOR GENERATIVE MODELS (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 UCGM provides a shared framework for training and sampling across
multi-step and few-step continuous generative models.

intent to diversify AI partnerships and strengthen its position as a
leading AI platform provider. The plans to host Grok could be
announced at Microsoft's Build developer conference on May 19.
