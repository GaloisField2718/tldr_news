 APPLE RUMORED TO FOLLOW CHATGPT WITH GENERATIVE AI FEATURES ON IPHONE
AS SOON AS IOS 18 (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/?utm_source=tldrai]


 Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology in iOS in
late 2024 at the earliest. The company will likely build hundreds of
AI servers over the next two years. It will probably offer a
combination of cloud-based and on-device AI. The time frame seems to
line up with the release of iOS 18. 

 INTRODUCING THE FOUNDATION MODEL TRANSPARENCY INDEX (7 MINUTE READ)
[https://hai.stanford.edu/news/introducing-foundation-model-transparency-index?utm_source=tldrai?utm_source=tldrai]


 A team of researchers from Stanford, MIT, and Princeton has developed
a transparency index to evaluate the level of transparency in
commercial foundation models. The index, known as the Foundation Model
Transparency Index (FMTI), assesses 100 different aspects of
transparency, and the results indicate that there is significant room
for improvement among major foundation model companies. 

 SHARED FATE: PROTECTING CUSTOMERS WITH GENERATIVE AI INDEMNIFICATION
(3 MINUTE READ)
[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification?utm_source=tldrai]


 Google is offering its customers two indemnities to mitigate the
risks associated with generative AI. The first covers training data,
protecting users against third-party intellectual property
infringements. The second, generated output indemnity, covers IP
claims made against content created using Google products, assuming
responsible AI practices are followed.

 EVALUATING CHATTING ABILITIES OF LLMS IN MULTI-TURN DIALOGUES (12
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13650v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This study assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
engage in human-like multi-turn conversations. 

 SALMONN: THE AI MODEL TUNED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD OF SOUND (18
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13289v1?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This paper introduces SALMONN, a unique AI model that combines text
understanding with the ability to process various audio inputs, from
speech to music. Not only does SALMONN perform well in trained audio
tasks like speech recognition, it also shows impressive emergent
skills like translating speech into untrained languages.

 MAKE A FINE-TUNE.JSONL PROGRAMMATICALLY (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/2023/10/17/enhancing-python-functions-with-instructor-a-guide-to-fine-tuning-and-distillation/?utm_source=tldrai]


 Tuning language models requires creating training data in a specific
format. This is often frustrating and slow. This post dives into easy
ways to automate that process. 

 A NEW APPROACH TO LIDAR PANOPTIC SEGMENTATION (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/abhinavagarwalla/most-lps?utm_source=tldrai] 

 This project presents a novel detection-centric network for lidar
panoptic segmentation (LPS) and tracking, moving away from the
traditional segmentation-focused methods. 

 IMPROVING OBJECT LOCALIZATION WITH A NEW METHOD (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/wpy1999/bas-extension?utm_source=tldrai] 

 Weakly supervised object localization helps find objects using only
simple picture labels. The new Background Activation Suppression (BAS)
method does this better by focusing on important parts of a picture
and ignoring the rest, showing amazing results on several datasets.

 EVERY APP THAT ADDS AI LOOKS LIKE THIS (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://botharetrue.substack.com/p/every-app-that-adds-ai-looks-like?utm_source=tldrai]


 The AI boom has led to an oversaturation of startups with some
raising massive funds on just a pitch deck, potentially indicating
overhype and overvaluation. Experts caution that not all startups are
innovators; many simply imitate. There should be more authenticity and
clarity in AI branding and utility and less marketing of subpar AI
tools as "magic". 

 CAN GPT-4 TEACH A ROBOT HAND TO DO PEN SPINNING TRICKS BETTER THAN
YOU DO? (7 MINUTE READ)

 Eureka is an open-ended agent that designs reward functions for robot
dexterity at a super-human level - it can learn pen-spinning tricks,
something that is difficult for CGI artists to animate frame by frame.

 Reddit may block search crawlers if it can't reach deals with
generative AI companies to pay for its data. More than 535 news
organizations have opted to block their content from being scraped by
AI companies. X's new reading limits are due to data scraping by AI
startups.
