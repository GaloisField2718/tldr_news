ELON MUSK CLAIMS TO BE WORKING ON ‚ÄòTRUTHGPT‚Äô ‚Äî A ‚ÄòMAXIMUM
TRUTH-SEEKING AI‚Äô (2 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23687440/elon-musk-truthgpt-ai-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrai]


Elon Musk has revealed plans to work on "TruthGPT," an AI alternative
to ChatGPT that aims to maximize truth-seeking. Musk shared his vision
during a Fox News interview, stating that an AI focused on
understanding the universe would be less likely to harm humans. He
suggests that OpenAI's profit incentives might compromise the ethics
of its AI models and sees TruthGPT as a more transparent option.
Musk's new AI company, X.AI, was established in March, but it remains
unclear how far along the development of TruthGPT is. 

DATASET RELEASED TO REPRODUCE LLAMA TRAINING (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama?utm_source=tldrai] 

The Llama models from Meta are powerful but unusable for many
commercial applications due to licensing restrictions. However,
because they‚Äôre so good, lots of folks have been building on top of
them. It starts to get tricky when people go to deploy them, however,
and often it is a complete impossibility. In the Llama paper they
describe the training mix proportions which have now been reproduced
as a 1.2 Trillion token dataset. Open models are coming soon. 

AI READINESS REPORT (12 MINUTE READ)
[https://scale.com/ai-readiness-report?utm_source=tldrai] 

56%-72% of companies have accelerated their AI plans because of the
recent generative AI progress. Many of these groups prefer to use open
source technology, while OpenAI's APIs are the dominant closed models
being used. The report outlines industries adopting AI technologies
and good things to know to help cut through the hype.

RESEARCH & INNOVATION

MULTIMODAL C4: AN OPEN, BILLION-SCALE CORPUS OF IMAGES INTERLEAVED
WITH TEXT (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06939?utm_source=tldrai] 

Multimodal C4 (mmc4) is a publicly available dataset that augments the
text-only c4 corpus with interleaved images, supporting in-context
vision and language models like Flamingo. The dataset, created using a
linear assignment algorithm with CLIP features, covers everyday topics
and contains 103M documents, 585M images, and 43B English tokens, with
90% of images being topically relevant. 

INSTRUCTION TUNING WITH GPT-4 (8 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03277?utm_source=tldrai] 

Utilizing GPT-4-generated instruction-following data for LLaMA
finetuning, researchers achieve superior zero-shot performance on new
tasks in both English and Chinese, surpassing previous
state-of-the-art models. This breakthrough is accompanied by
comprehensive evaluation and reward model training, with the data and
codebase made publicly available. 

CEREBRAS-GPT: EFFICIENT, SCALABLE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH OPEN COMPUTE
(18 MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03208?utm_source=tldrai] 

Cerebras-GPT, a family of compute-optimal language models,
demonstrates state-of-the-art training efficiency on pre-training and
downstream objectives by leveraging advances in efficient pretraining,
scaling, and Maximal Update Parameterization. As the first open and
reproducible work comparing compute-optimal model scaling, pre-trained
models and code are publicly released.

ENGINEERING & RESOURCES

INPAINT ANYTHING (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/geekyutao/Inpaint-Anything?utm_source=tldrai] 

Inpaint Anything (IA) is a new mask-free image inpainting paradigm
that combines various models to create a powerful and user-friendly
solution for inpainting tasks. IA offers three main features: Remove
Anything, Fill Anything, and Replace Anything, allowing users to edit
images using clicks and text-based prompts seamlessly. 

SOUNDINI: SOUND-GUIDED DIFFUSION FOR NATURAL VIDEO EDITING (3 MINUTE
READ) [https://kuai-lab.github.io/soundini-gallery/?utm_source=tldrai]


The proposed method introduces zero-shot sound-guided visual effects
for video editing, utilizing temporal sound features to create dynamic
styles while maintaining temporal consistency. By guiding denoising
diffusion probabilistic models with audio latent representations and
using optical flow-based guidance, the approach outperforms existing
techniques, generating realistic visual effects that correspond with
sound properties. 

MULTILINGUAL TEXT2IMAGE MODEL (GITHUB REPO)
[https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2?utm_source=tldrai] 

A nice new text to image model that can handle multiple languages. The
output is high quality as it was trained on LAION HighRes and an
internal proprietary dataset of images. It doesn‚Äôt work with
diffusers, but they have an online demo. It seems to have more
parameters than stable diffusion but might be smaller than the new XL
model in the works.
