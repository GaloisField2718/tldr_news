 GENERATIVE AI TAUGHT A ROBOT DOG TO SCRAMBLE AROUND A NEW ENVIRONMENT
(5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LucidSim, a new system that uses generative AI and physics
simulation, improves robot training by creating virtual environments
that closely mimic real-world conditions. Robots trained with LucidSim
outperform those using traditional simulations in tasks like parkour
and navigating obstacles. This novel AI approach could lead to fully
virtual training for diverse AI agents. It is being extended to more
complex robotic tasks.
