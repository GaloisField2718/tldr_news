GOOGLE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ARE BUILDING AN AI-POWERED
MICROSCOPE (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/google-dod-built-an-ai-powered-microscope-to-help-doctors-spot-cancer.html?utm_source=tldrai]

The Department of Defense has teamed up with Google to build an
AI-powered microscope that can help doctors better identify cancer. 

WRITER NETS $100M FOR ITS ENTERPRISE-FOCUSED GENERATIVE AI PLATFORM (4
MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/writer-nets-100m-for-its-enterprise-focused-generative-ai-platform/?utm_source=tldrai]

Writer, who is developing a "full-stack" generative AI platform for
businesses, has secured $100M in Series B funding led by ICONIQ
Growth. The funds will advance its "industry-specific" text-generating
AI models. Differentiating itself in a competitive market, Writer
focuses on non-copyrighted business writing, cost-effective models,
transparency, and ensuring that no training is done using customer
data. 

DATABRICKS RAISES $500M, BOOSTING VALUATION TO $43B DESPITE LATE-STAGE
GLOOM (3 MINUTE READ)
[https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/databricks-raises-500m-more-boosting-valuation-to-43b-despite-late-stage-gloom/?utm_source=tldrai]

Databricks has secured over $500 million in a Series I round, boosting
its valuation to $43 billion. Noteworthy investors include T. Rowe
Price, Morgan Stanley, and Nvidia. Despite wider market funding
slowdowns, Databricks' strong revenue growth and run rate suggest an
eventual IPO could exceed its current valuation.

NEW LANGUAGE MODEL OBJECTIVE TRAINS FASTER WITH TIED EMBEDDINGS (27
MINUTE READ) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08351?utm_source=tldrai]

Typically with language models, the input and output embedding layers
are tied together. However, if you tie the input embedding to other
embeddings within the model, and use a contrastive loss, you can get
dramatically improved performance both in wall clock and final
benchmark accuracy. 

FINE-TUNING VISION TRANSFORMERS MORE EFFICIENTLY (29 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08513v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Fine-tuning pre-trained vision models for specific tasks often
requires a lot of extra computing power. Researchers have come up with
a method called "Salient Channel Tuning" (SCT) that smartly picks
which parts of a model to fine-tune, using way fewer extra settings
and still outperforming other methods in almost all tested tasks. 

WHEN LLMS MEET EXTERNAL INFO (23 MINUTE READ)
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08594v1?utm_source=tldrai]

Large language models like GPT-3 are smart because they learn from a
ton of data, but how do they react when new information conflicts with
what they already know? Researchers have found that these models can
get confused and give wrong answers, especially when they face
conflicting or distracting info, raising concerns about how reliable
they can be.

WHY OPEN SOURCE AI WILL WIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[https://varunshenoy.substack.com/p/why-open-source-ai-will-win?utm_source=tldrai]

Open source AI models have significant advantages over proprietary
models. For most AI applications, controllability, customizability,
transparency, and trust are more important than advanced reasoning
abilities. AI-native companies should focus on owning their core
models rather than outsourcing their intelligence layer to external
providers. 

BLENDING 2D AND 3D FOR IMAGE CREATION (3 MINUTE READ)

ROBUST E-NERF: BETTER 3D MODELS (4 MINUTE READ)
[https://wengflow.github.io/robust-e-nerf/?utm_source=tldrai]

Event cameras have some cool benefits like low power use and quick
response times, but they struggle with creating detailed 3D models of
scenes. Researchers have introduced Robust e-NeRF, a new method that
makes these cameras much better at building 3D models, even in
challenging conditions like fast motion or varying light.

IT‚ÄôS TOO EARLY TO REGULATE AI (10 MINUTE READ)
[https://blog.eladgil.com/p/ai-regulation?utm_source=tldrai]

This article makes the argument that we should wait to regulate AI, as
regulation frequently results in reduced competition and production,
economic benefits moving overseas, and a government-centric instead of
a user-centric industry. 

WHY AI CAN‚ÄôT MAKE HUMAN CREATIVITY OBSOLETE (6 MINUTE READ)
[https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/why-ai-cant-make-human-creativity?utm_source=tldrai]

Despite concerns that AI would render human creativity obsolete, we
continue to appreciate human endeavors, like chess, even when AI
performs better. This paradox arises because humans value
imperfection, surprises, and shared experiences, which AI, with its
constant optimization, cannot replicate.
