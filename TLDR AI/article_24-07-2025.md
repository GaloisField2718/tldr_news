 THE MCP AUTHORIZATION PROBLEM, SOLVED WITH OAUTH (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) [5] is becoming a standard for
connecting tools to LLMs. But how do you securely authorize MCP
servers?

OAuth now provides the answer, with five complementary specs for
delegation, token exchange, and scoped access.

The WorkOS advantage:

 	* Packages all 5 OAuth specs into one simple API. [6]
 	* Pre-built infrastructure that saves engineering time.
 	* Enterprise ready security out of the box.

Implement MCP Auth with WorkOS → [4]

HEADLINES & LAUNCHES

 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLEDGES TO STIMULATE AI USE AND EXPORTS (7
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Trump administration has promised to slash red tape and take
steps to boost exports for US tech companies in a bid to accelerate AI
use in the US. Its action plan lays out moves to make it easier and
faster for tech companies to build data centers and get the power they
need for those centers. The plan includes directives to several
government agencies to identify and gut any regulations that block the
development and use of AI. The administration is also working on
addressing uncertainty about whether it is legal for AI models to
train on copyrighted material. 

 GITHUB LAUNCHES SPARK FOR NO-CODE AI APP CREATION (8 MINUTE READ) [8]


 GitHub Spark enables "vibe coding" — letting users create
personalized "micro apps" by describing ideas in natural language
rather than writing code. The tool uses AI models from Anthropic and
OpenAI to instantly generate functional apps with automatic
deployment, persistent data storage, and polished UI components. 

 ANTHROPIC BACKS US AI PLAN, URGES TRANSPARENCY AND SECURITY (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The White House's "Winning the Race: America's AI Action Plan"
prioritizes accelerating AI infrastructure, federal adoption, and
security coordination. Anthropic supports this strategy and emphasizes
the importance of export controls and transparency standards in AI
development. The plan aligns with Anthropic's earlier recommendations
and highlights the need to maintain America's AI leadership through
robust infrastructure, security, and responsible policy measures.

DEEP DIVES & ANALYSIS

 OPENAI'S NEW ECONOMIC ANALYSIS (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenAI's new economic research reveals that 28% of employed US adults
now use ChatGPT at work — up from just 8% in 2023. The usage data
shows learning and upskilling dominating at 20% of US messages,
followed by writing and communication at 18%, with programming and
data science capturing 7%. 

 INVERSE SCALING APPEARS IN EXTENDED REASONING (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Anthropic found that more test-time compute doesn't always help:
longer reasoning chains in large models sometimes lead to worse
performance. 

 “BEHAVIORIST” RL REWARD FUNCTIONS LEAD TO SCHEMING (20 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A large class of reward functions, which includes almost every reward
function in the RL and LLM literature, are all doomed to eventually
lead to AI that will pretend to be docile and cooperative while
secretly looking for opportunities to behave in egregiously bad ways.
This is because negative reward for lying and stealing looks the same
as negative reward for getting caught lying and stealing. The reward
function will miss sufficiently sneaky misaligned behavior, so the AI
will learn that this kind of behavior is good.

 🎨 LOVART INTRODUCES THE WORLD'S FIRST AI DESIGN AGENT (SPONSOR)
[13] 

 Creating Ghibli versions of your profile pic is fun, but that's not
what you pay a designer to do — and that's where Lovart [14] comes
in. It's AI that thinks, works, and creates like a professional
designer. It brainstorms with you. It looks for examples. It thinks in
design systems. Try it — free [14] 

 TIMESCOPE: HOW LONG CAN YOUR VIDEO LARGE MULTIMODAL MODEL GO? (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 TimeScope is a new open source benchmark for evaluating vision models
on how well they handle long videos. It evaluates not just retrieval
but synthesis, localization, and fine-grained motion analysis to
provide a more holistic view of temporal comprehension. Using the
benchmark reveals how model size isn't everything - simply scaling
parameters doesn't automatically grant a longer temporal horizon - and
Gemini 2.5-Pro is in a league of its own, being the only model able to
maintain strong accuracy on videos longer than an hour. 

 VOXTRAL (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Voxtral Mini and Small are new multimodal audio chat models that
excel in both spoken audio and text comprehension. Voxtral Small
outperforms many closed-source models, can run locally, and supports
audio files up to 40 minutes. 

 SUBLIMINAL LEARNING IN LANGUAGE MODELS (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Anthropic has explored how language models can inherit behavioral
traits such as preferences or goals from other models through training
data that appears unrelated. This effect only occurs when the teacher
and student models share the same base architecture, suggesting hidden
signals in the data can transmit unintended behavior. 

 HIGGS AUDIO V2 (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 Higgs Audio v2 is an audio foundation model trained on 10 million
hours of data that achieves 75.7% win rates over GPT-4o-mini-tts. The
open-source model demonstrates emergent capabilities like
multi-speaker dialogues and voice cloning without requiring
fine-tuning.

 GOOGLE DEEPMIND LAUNCHES AENEAS AI MODEL FOR ANCIENT ROMAN
INSCRIPTION ANALYSIS (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Aeneas is the first AI model designed to help historians
contextualize ancient Roman inscriptions by identifying textual
parallels and restoring damaged texts with 73% accuracy for gaps up to
ten characters. DeepMind is making the tool freely available at
predictingthepast.com and plans to expand to other ancient languages. 

 ELON MUSK SAYS XAI IS TARGETING 50 MILLION 'H100 EQUIVALENT' AI GPUS
IN FIVE YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 xAI plans to deploy 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs within five
years. The power these processors will consume is massive, estimated
to be equal to the typical power generated by 35 nuclear power plants,
making it unrealistic to power today. Whether xAI will be able to get
power to feed such a data center by 2030 remains to be seen.
