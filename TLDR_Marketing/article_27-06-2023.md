### Summary 
 This drug can give us an edge in the bacteria-antibiotics arms race (2 minute read)Bacteria can evolve genetic survival tactics much faster than humans can find new drugs to kill them.

Their study suggests that it may be possible to slow down pathogen evolution to the point where the body's immune system can deal with the infection without antibiotics. Global antibiotic resistance was responsible for nearly 1.3 million deaths in 2019.
