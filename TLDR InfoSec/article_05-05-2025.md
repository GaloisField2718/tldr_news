ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 WGET TO WIPEOUT: MALICIOUS GO MODULES FETCH DESTRUCTIVE PAYLOAD (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Socket found three malicious Go modules with hidden code that can
download payloads to wipe a Linux system's primary disk (/dev/sda),
making it unbootable. Attackers exploited the decentralized nature of
the Go ecosystem and confusion around namespace validity to disguise
malicious modules as legitimate. The payloads executed commands that
wiped disks, causing irreversible data loss and severe disruptions for
affected organizations.

"Cyber Detective," "Attack the Net," and "Defend the Net" that
demonstrate cybersecurity concepts from both attacker and defender
perspectives, accomplishing in days what would have previously taken
him weeks or months to develop. 

 WHY MFA IS GETTING EASIER TO BYPASS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Phishing-as-a-service toolkits allow criminals to bypass common
multifactor authentication (MFA) through adversary-in-the-middle
attacks. These tools create proxy servers that intercept credentials
and MFA codes between victims and legitimate sites. While traditional
MFA (one-time codes or push notifications) is vulnerable,
WebAuthn-based authentication (passkeys) remains resistant because
credentials are cryptographically bound to specific URLs and devices. 

 SLOW PISCES TARGETS DEVELOPERS WITH CODING CHALLENGES AND INTRODUCES
NEW CUSTOMIZED PYTHON MALWARE (11 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Slow Pisces is a North Korean hacking group primarily focused on
generating revenue for the DPRK by targeting cryptocurrency
organizations. A new campaign associated with Slow Pisces involves
reaching out to cryptocurrency developers and directing them to a

and runs a malicious C2 server. If the victim opts for a Python
interview, the malware is launched via YAML deserialization, whereas
if they opt for a JavaScript interview, the malware is loaded via ejs
templates.
