ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MCLAREN HEALTH CARE HIT BY ANOTHER DATA BREACH, EXPOSING 743K
PEOPLE'S DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 McLaren Health Care suffered another data breach in July-August 2024,
exposing the personal and medical information of 750,000 people.
Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses,
and health records. This follows a 2023 ransomware attack by BlackCat
that affected over 2 million people. 

 CANADA SAYS TELCOS WERE BREACHED IN CHINA-LINKED ESPIONAGE HACKS (1
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Canadian government and the FBI report that China-backed Salt
Typhoon hackers targeted Canadian telecoms, compromising at least one
provider in February by manipulating Cisco routers for traffic
collection. The group, active since 2024, previously hit U.S. telecoms
and is expected to continue targeting Canadian organizations through
2027. 

 CYBERCRIMINALS BREACH AFLAC AS PART OF HACKING SPREE AGAINST US
INSURANCE INDUSTRY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Insurance giant Aflac has announced it suffered a breach due to a
social engineering attack. The breached information includes SSNs,
insurance claims, and health information. Experts suspect that the
attackers were the Scattered Spider ransomware group.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MITIGATING PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS WITH A LAYERED DEFENSE STRATEGY
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has implemented a layered security approach to protect Gemini
AI from indirect prompt injection attacks. Its defenses include
content classifiers detecting malicious instructions, security thought
reinforcement, URL sanitization, user confirmation frameworks, and
security notifications. This multi-layer strategy makes attacks more
difficult and expensive while keeping users informed about threats. 

 THE RISE OF RESIDENTIAL PROXIES AS CYBERCRIME ENABLERS (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Residential proxy providers offer millions of IP addresses from
residential devices such as laptops, set-top boxes, and IoT smart
devices. Residential proxies can provide cybercriminals with many IPs
to cycle through while blending in with legitimate user traffic.
Defenders should use JA4+ fingerprinting or other session-based
defenses. 

 SPYING ON SCREEN ACTIVITY USING CHROMIUM BROWSERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 By default, Chromium-based browsers require users to consent to
screen sharing and choose a screen to share to allow websites to
capture a user's screen. However, these security researchers developed
an attack that uses the `-- auto-select-desktop-capture-source`
command line flag to enable screen sharing automatically. This attack
can be chained with a headless browser or a small browser launched
off-screen to hide the window from a user.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S PYTHON (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Should you build automation with custom code or a low-code platform?
This guide [12] helps teams weigh the two options, and understand the
security, usability, and performance advantages of low-code
automation. Inside: get a side-by-side comparison of Tines vs Python
across common building components (HTTP requests, webhooks, data
manipulation) + a case study example of automating a Slack news feed
with both. Download the guide: _Understanding Alternative Approaches
to Automation_ [12] 

 NPQ (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 NPQ is a security tool that audits npm/yarn packages before
installation, running safety checks like vulnerability scans, package
age verification, download count analysis, and malicious script
detection. It prompts users for confirmation if issues arise, then
allows npm or yarn to proceed with installation. 

 CLOUDREC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 CloudRec is an open-source, multi-cloud security posture management
(CSPM) platform.

 NEW AI JAILBREAK BYPASSES GUARDRAILS WITH EASE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 "Echo Chamber" is a new AI jailbreak technique that manipulates LLM
context through progressive "poisoning" with acceptable prompts.
Unlike direct attacks, it plants innocent "steering seeds" that
gradually guide models toward prohibited responses. Testing showed
over 90% success rates for generating harmful content across major AI
models. 

 IRAN'S INTERNET: A CENSYS PERSPECTIVE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Iran faced a near-total internet blackout from June 18, hitting its
lowest visibility on June 21 before gradually recovering. Some
networks, like AS25124 (DATAK) and AS1756 (HAMYAR-AS), recovered
slowly, while others, such as AS42337 (RESPINA-AS) and AS50810
(MOBINNET-AS), were fully restored. The Telecommunication
Infrastructure Company (TIC) acts as a key bottleneck, providing
transit for all networks with the weakest recovery.
