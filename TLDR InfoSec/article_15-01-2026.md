 BEST PRACTICES FOR UNCERTAIN TIMES: 1PASSWORD'S NEW FRAMEWORK FOR
IDENTITY SECURITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As 2026 begins, businesses are contending with a fragmented threat
landscape. Identities, applications, devices, and AI-driven tools are
multiplying, often outside of IT or security's control. 

In the face of these fractured, unmanaged threats, the need for a
_unified_ approach to identity security has never been greater.

On January 22nd, join three security leaders for a discussion on how
they're:

	* Achieving comprehensive visibility and control
	* Using IT to drive business outcomes
	* Applying zero trust principles to an AI-driven world

Forward-thinking security and IT leaders won't want to miss this
visionary conversation.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CONVINCING LINKEDIN COMMENT-REPLY TACTIC USED IN NEW PHISHING (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Scammers are flooding LinkedIn posts with fake reply comments from
company pages impersonating LinkedIn (e.g., "Linked Very"), warning
users about bogus policy violations and directing them to
credential-harvesting sites. The campaign gains credibility by using
LinkedIn's official lnkd.in URL shortener to mask phishing domains,
making malicious links harder to identify without clicking. LinkedIn
confirmed awareness and emphasized that it never communicates policy
violations through public comments. 

 CYBERATTACK FORCES BELGIAN HOSPITAL TO TRANSFER CRITICAL CARE
PATIENTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A ransomware attack on AZ Monica hospital in Antwerp severely
disrupted IT systems, forcing servers offline and halting most
surgeries and many treatments, including imaging and chemotherapy.
Critical patients were moved with Red Cross help, while other
hospitals, including Amsterdam UMC, took over urgent chemotherapy. 

 PERSONAL DETAILS OF THOUSANDS OF BORDER PATROL AND ICE AGENTS
ALLEGEDLY LEAKED IN HUGE DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sensitive data belonging to around 4,500 ICE and Border Patrol
employees has been released by a Department of Homeland Security
whistleblower. The leaked data includes names, work emails, phone
numbers, roles, and some resume data. The data was leaked to the ICE
List website, which stated that it would conduct a manual review to
filter out certain roles before releasing the data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VOIDLINK: THE CLOUD-NATIVE MALWARE FRAMEWORK (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VoidLink is a sophisticated Zig-based Linux malware framework from
Chinese-affiliated developers. It features a cloud-first design that
detects AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba, and Tencent environments and adapts
its behavior based on detected EDRs and security controls. The
framework includes 37+ plugins inspired by Cobalt Strike's BOF
architecture, environment-adaptive rootkit deployment (LD_PRELOAD,
eBPF, or LKM-based on the kernel version), and multiple C2 channels,
including HTTP, DNS tunneling, ICMP, and P2P mesh networking.
VoidLink's credential-harvesting targets cloud environments, Git
repositories, and SSH keys, suggesting that software engineers and
cloud infrastructure are primary targets for espionage or supply chain
attacks. 

 CVE-2025-64155: THREE YEARS OF REMOTELY ROOTING THE FORTINET
FORTISIEM (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A series of vulnerabilities in Fortinet's FortiSIEM platform allows a
remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain full control of the
appliance, from admin access to root. The weakness lies in how the
phMonitor service processes certain storage-related requests,
ultimately enabling crafted data to reach a curl-based health-check
script and inject extra arguments. By abusing curl's features, an
attacker can write arbitrary files as the FortiSIEM admin user and
then leverage a writable script executed by root via cron to escalate
privileges. Combined, these flaws permit long-term, stealthy
compromise of FortiSIEM deployments. 

 CHOOSING A MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The UK's NCSC released a guide and checklist for small- to
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking to choose a Managed Service
Provider (MSP) for IT and security services. Organizations should
request any certifications the MSP has, customer testimonials, and
ensure the MSP communicates clearly and transparently. Organizations
should also ask the MSP about their policies on patching, backups,
data access, logging, and incident response.

 PHYSICAL ATTACKS ON CRYPTO HOLDERS - WRENCH ASSAULTS RISING? (7
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 France has experienced a surge in violent "wrench attacks" targeting
cryptocurrency holders and their relatives between 2024 and 2026,
exploiting self-custody's fundamental weakness: anyone with the key or
seed phrase can irreversibly transfer funds without bank intervention.
Attackers identify targets through public displays of wealth on social
media, data leaks from crypto firms like Ledger, and potentially
compromised access to government databases, including new EU
crypto-asset reporting systems under DAC8. Recommended mitigations
include operational security measures, time-locked transactions, and
multisignature wallet schemes requiring geographically distributed
keys. 

 RESEARCHERS NULL-ROUTE OVER 550 KIMWOLF AND AISURU BOTNET COMMAND
SERVERS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Black Lotus Labs null-routed over 550 C2 nodes associated with the
AISURU/Kimwolf botnet, which has infected more than 2 million Android
devices—primarily unsanctioned TV streaming boxes with exposed
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) services. The botnet exploits
vulnerabilities in residential proxy services to propagate, turning
compromised devices into proxy nodes for DDoS attacks and malicious
traffic relay. Security teams should monitor for ADB exposure on
network devices and block traffic to the identified C2 infrastructure.


 I ALMOST LOST MY APPLE ACCOUNT TO THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PHISHING
ATTACK I'VE EVER SEEN (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A security-conscious user received several 2FA prompts and SMS
verification codes for their Apple account one afternoon, followed by
an automated call warning them that their account was under attack.
After receiving this call, a second call came from a very
professional-sounding employee who created a support case for the
user, verified that it was from Apple to build trust, and walked the
user through resetting their password. The phish then had the user
“close the case” via an SMS link, which directed them to a
sophisticated phishing site where they could steal the user's
credentials.

risk, and 91% of large organizations are revising cybersecurity
strategies due to geopolitical volatility.
