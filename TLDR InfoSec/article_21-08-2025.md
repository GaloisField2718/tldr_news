TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-08-21

 VENDOR-DEFINED RULES AND FLASHY UIS WILL ONLY GET YOU SO FAR:
EMBRACING DETECTION-AS-CODE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Security UIs feel great when you have a handful of rules to manage.
Then you start to notice the cracks: no version control, no testing,
poor collaboration… Sound familiar?

The better alternative is to apply development practices to security
rules. This blog [4] covers:

 	* A detection-as-code approach using Git for rule versioning, CI/CD
for deployment, and automated testing for validation.
 	* Fastly's WAF Simulator [4] that tests rules against both attack
scenarios and legitimate traffic before deployment.
 	* Why effective detection engineering can't rely solely on
vendor-provided defaults

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 APACHE ACTIVEMQ FLAW EXPLOITED TO DEPLOY DRIPDROPPER MALWARE ON CLOUD
LINUX SYSTEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threat actors are exploiting a two-year-old critical Apache ActiveMQ
vulnerability (CVE-2023-46604, CVSS 10.0) to deploy DripDropper
malware on cloud Linux systems, then patching the flaw post-compromise
to block other attackers and evade detection. The attackers use the
PyInstaller-based DripDropper to establish persistence through
modified SSH configurations and cron jobs, while leveraging legitimate
services like Dropbox and Cloudflare Tunnels for command-and-control
communications. 

 DON'T WANT DRIVE-BY OLLAMA ATTACKERS SNOOPING ON YOUR LOCAL CHATS?
PATCH NOW (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A vulnerability in Ollama Desktop v0.10.0 allowed drive-by attacks
where malicious websites could bypass CORS controls to reconfigure
victims' local AI settings remotely, intercept all chat messages, and
even serve poisoned models. GitLab's Chris Moberly discovered the flaw
by exploiting incomplete cross-origin controls—removing the
Content-Type header to trick the app into treating malicious requests
as "simple" and bypassing preflight checks. The vulnerability was
patched within hours in v0.10.1 after Moberly disclosed it on July 31.
Users are urged to update immediately as exploitation would be
"trivial," according to the researcher. 

 HACKERS STEAL MICROSOFT LOGINS USING LEGITIMATE ADFS REDIRECTS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Push Security researchers found a new phishing attack using legit
office.com links combined with ADFS to redirect users to a phishing
page that steals Microsoft 365 logins. The attack starts when users
click on malicious sponsored links in Google search results for Office
265 (likely typosquatting), which leads to Microsoft's office.com,
then to a harmless-looking page that redirects to the phishing site.
The attackers are using a custom Microsoft tenant with ADFS to receive
authorization requests for the fake domain.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CRYPTOAGILITY: THE STRATEGIC PILLAR FOR DIGITAL RESILIENCE (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Cryptoagility, defined as the ability to replace cryptographic
algorithms, keys, and certificates quickly, has become vital for
organizations managing critical infrastructure, as shown by Google's
Chromecast failure that affected millions when a certificate expired.
Organizations must shift from reactive to proactive certificate
management, using modular infrastructure, centralized PKI/HSM, and
automated rotation aligned with PCI DSS v4.0 and DORA. This
forward-looking approach makes cryptographic flexibility a strategic
advantage, ensuring operational continuity and compliance before
vulnerabilities or expirations cause system failures. 

 HOW I HACKED MCDONALD'S (THEIR SECURITY CONTACT WAS HARDER TO FIND
THAN THEIR SECRET SAUCE RECIPE) (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The author of this post uncovered several vulnerabilities at
McDonald's, like weak app and portal security, exposed API keys, and
user data leaks. Despite attempts to report the issues, finding
someone to listen was nearly impossible—the process required calling
HQ and guessing employee names. Most bugs were fixed once reported,
but communication and security practices at McDonald's were deeply
flawed. 

 HIGH-PROFILE CLOUD PRIVESC (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post details an attack path from an Entra service principal with
`Files.ReadWrite.All` permissions to admin. The attacker exploited
OneDrive for Business's Known File Move feature to load a PowerShell
profile with a beacon from OneDrive into admins' filesystems. It
concludes with defender tips on detection and credential protection.

 MICROSOFT ENTRA PRIVATE ACCESS BRINGS CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO ON-PREM
ACTIVE DIRECTORY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Microsoft's Entra Private Access now allows organizations to apply
cloud-based conditional access and MFA to on-premises Active Directory
domain controllers, replacing legacy VPNs with Zero Trust Network
Access. It requires networks to be NTLM-free and Kerberos-only,
Windows 10+ devices that are Entra or hybrid joined, opening TCP port
1337 on domain controllers, and extensive NTLM auditing and removal.
Organizations must audit NTLM usage via Group Policy, transition to
NTLMv2 or Kerberos, and possibly retire legacy apps before
implementing this security framework.

 SINGAPORE ISSUES CRITICAL ALERT ON DIRE WOLF RANSOMWARE TARGETING
GLOBAL TECH AND MANUFACTURING FIRMS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Dire Wolf ransomware has affected 16 organizations across 11
countries since it emerged in May, using double-extortion tactics,
such as encrypting data while threatening leaks. The Golang-based
ransomware uses anti-forensics techniques and multi-stage attack
chains to evade detection, mainly targeting manufacturing and
technology sectors through phishing and credential stuffing attacks. 

 PYPI NOW BLOCKS DOMAIN RESURRECTION ATTACKS USED FOR HIJACKING
ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Accounts of project maintainers publishing software on PyPI are
linked to email addresses, which in some cases may be tied to a custom
domain name. Historically, attackers have been able to take over some
projects by resurrecting an expired domain that was attached to a
maintainer's email and resetting the account. PyPI has added new
checks that will mark an email as unverified if a domain is expired or
is about to expire. 

 NEW ZERO-DAY STARTUP OFFERS $20 MILLION FOR TOOLS THAT CAN HACK ANY
SMARTPHONE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A UAE-based startup is offering huge bounties—up to $20
million—for hacking tools that exploit zero-day flaws in all major
smartphone systems. The firm, which serves governments and
intelligence agencies, is secretive about its clients. The offer
reflects rising demand and prices for cyber-espionage tools.
