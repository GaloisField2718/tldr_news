 UNMANAGED IOT DEVICES ARE GROWING NETWORK VULNERABILITIES (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 +90% of ransomware attacks leverage unmanaged devices in the network
to gain access to systems and assets, according to a Microsoft report.

What can you do to prevent IoT attacks?

To answer this question, ThreatLocker is hosting a free webinar on
November 5th [4] at 11 a.m. EST. CEO and Co-Founder Danny Jenkins and
CPO Rob Allen will share what it takes to secure your organization and
the corporate devices across your network — both managed and
unmanaged.

You'll also hear about previous cyberattacks using compromised IoT
devices [4], and enter trivia for a chance to win tickets to Zero

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FAKE GOOGLE MEET CONFERENCE ERRORS PUSH INFOSTEALING MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Security researchers are warning of new ClickFix campaigns that use
fake Google Meet pages to distribute malware. The ClickFix campaign
works by sending users a fake Google Meet link that masquerades as a
Google Meet loading room informing users of an issue with their
headphones or microphones. The page then prompts users to copy and
execute a Powershell command to fix the issue, which downloads malware
to the device. The article includes IoCs. 

 INTERNET ARCHIVE HACKED AGAIN DURING SERVICE RESTORATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 After recovering from a data breach and DDoS attack, the Internet
Archive has reported another attack. This attack involved a
compromised Zendesk token with users being notified by an
attacker-sent email. Compromised information includes potentially
sensitive data that was sent in support cases. 

 MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT VULN IS UNDER ACTIVE EXPLOIT (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 A severe Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2024-38094) is being
actively exploited. The flaw allows authenticated attackers with Site
Owner permissions to execute remote code. Please patch ASAP.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HUNTING FOR REMOTE MANAGEMENT TOOLS: DETECTING RMMS (9 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This blog post discusses hunting for Remote Management and Monitoring
(RMM) tools in organizations, highlighting challenges in identifying
different tools. By searching for keywords in various fields like
filenames and process command lines, the likelihood of detecting RMMs
increases. The query language used to search through SIEM logs helps
optimize the process by attributing events to specific RMM tools based
on identified keywords. 

 USING NIX TO FUZZ TEST A PDF PARSER (PART ONE) (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post discusses how Nix simplified fuzz testing by automating
setup and execution with a single command. The process involved
compiling the PDF reader from source, generating test inputs, and
identifying bugs. Nix allows beginners to fuzz test efficiently and
discover vulnerabilities in software. 

 SPOOFING INTERNAL PACKETS FOR MULTIHOMED LINUX DEVICES (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 A vulnerability in multihomed Linux devices can be exploited to spoof
and inject packets into internal communication streams. This issue can
be leveraged by attackers with adjacent network access to manipulate
data flows on devices like NAT routers and virtual machines.
Mitigations such as anti-spoofing firewall rules and socket binding
can help protect against these attacks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DLL PROXY GENERATOR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DLL Proxy Generator is a tool to create a proxy DLL for an arbitrary
DLL that optionally loads a secondary DLL. 

 VULNHUNTR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Vulnhuntr leverages the power of LLMs to automatically create and
analyze entire code call chains starting from remote user input and
ending at server output for detection of complex, multi-step,
security-bypassing vulnerabilities that go far beyond what traditional
static code analysis tools are capable of performing. 

 MALLOX RANSOMWARE DECRYPTOR (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Free decryption tool for Mallox ransomware that targets files
encrypted in 2023 or early 2024, and which have the extensions
.bitenc, .ma1x0, .mallab, .malox, .mallox, .malloxx, and .xollam.

 NOT ALL TYPES OF MFA ARE CREATED EQUAL (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The UK's NCSC has released updated MFA guidance to address new
threats. Foremost in its guidance, the NCSC recommends using
phishing-resistant factors. Additionally, the NCSC recommends only
prompting for MFA when necessary and provides an example of utilizing
MDM-managed laptops and mobile devices as a factor instead of
requiring a prompt. 

 HAVE YOU BEEN KEEPING UP WITH YOUR LOW CONFIDENCE DETECTIONS? (6
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Traditionally, detection engineering focuses on prioritizing high
confidence, high severity alerts to not overwhelm SOC analysts. Teams
should also utilize low-confidence alerts. These alerts can be useful
to provide more context to the full cyber kill chain that attackers
utilized and can also detect activity that may be relevant but did not
trigger a high confidence, high severity alert. 

 LINKEDIN FINED $335 MILLION IN EU FOR TRACKING ADS PRIVACY BREACHES
(3 MINUTE READ) [16]
