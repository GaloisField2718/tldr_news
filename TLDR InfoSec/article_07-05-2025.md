ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HUNDREDS OF E-COMMERCE SITES HACKED IN SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Malware has backdoored at least 500 e-commerce sites by compromising
three software providers (Tigren, Magesolution, and Meetanshi) that
supply Magento-based extensions. The dormant malware, active after six
years, executes malicious code in visitors' browsers to steal payment
information and personal data. 

 SOLANA PATCHES BUG THAT COULD HAVE ALLOWED ATTACKERS TO MINT AND
SWIPE TOKENS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Solana Foundation recently patched a zero-day bug in Solana that
could have allowed an attacker to mint unlimited Token-22 confidential
tokens or steal them from other users. The vulnerability was due to
some algebraic components of the ZK ElGamal Proof Program not being
included in the hash used to generate a transcript for the Fiat-Shamir
Transformation. Solana worked with several security partners to verify
the fix and found no evidence of exploitation. 

 VENOM SPIDER TARGETS HIRING MANAGERS IN A PHISHING SCHEME (4 MINUTE

distractor and uses a .lnk file to download an obfuscated BAT file
loader, which ultimately downloads a dropper called More_eggs.
