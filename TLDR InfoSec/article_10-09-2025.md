 USB DRIVES ARE STILL A PROBLEM - BUT THEY'RE NOT YOUR ONLY DATA
EXFILTRATION RISK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While most organizations focus on blocking USB devices, attackers and
insiders can just as easily steal data through network shares, cloud
storage, or even local folder access. You need visibility and control
over ALL storage access points.

ThreatLocker Storage Control [4] provides granular policies across
every storage type [4] - from USB drives to network shares to local
folders. Set policies as simple as "block all USBs" or as detailed as
"only allow backup apps to access the backup share."

⚡ Unified audit logs every file access with device serial numbers

⚡ 60-second approval workflow for storage access requests

⚡ Granular policies by user, time, application, and device type

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PLEX URGES USERS TO CHANGE PASSWORDS AFTER DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Plex disclosed a breach exposing user data, including usernames,
emails, scrambled passwords, and some auth data. Though the passwords
are unreadable, Plex urges users to reset and sign out of connected
devices. 

 NO GAINS, JUST PAINS AS 1.6M FITNESS PHONE CALL RECORDINGS EXPOSED
ONLINE (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler uncovered an unprotected HelloGym
database with 1.6 million audio recordings from major gym franchises,
exposing customer and staff names, phone numbers, and sensitive
conversations. Risks include voice cloning, deepfakes, and social
engineering. 

 160,000 IMPACTED BY WAYNE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Over 160,000 people had personal and medical data stolen in a
ransomware attack on Wayne Memorial Hospital in May 2024. Hackers
accessed sensitive personal, health, and financial information. The
hospital responded quickly, restored systems, and offered affected
individuals free credit monitoring.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LUNALOCK RANSOMWARE THREATENS VICTIMS BY FEEDING STOLEN DATA TO AI
MODELS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 LunaLock, a new ransomware group, has threatened to submit stolen
artwork from the Artists&Clients website to AI companies for training
datasets if its $50,000 ransom demand isn't met. This approach, a
unique extortion technique, represents a dangerous precedent as it
compromises victims' intellectual property permanently by
incorporating stolen data into AI models, unlike traditional dark web
leaks that may fade over time. The attack targets artists who are
already vulnerable to AI data scraping by companies like OpenAI and
Google. 

 GITHUB ACTIONS: A CLOUDY DAY FOR SECURITY - PART 1 (16 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Security challenges in GitHub Actions can affect even trusted teams,
as attackers may exploit workflows or inject malicious code. Using
branch protection, pull request approvals, environment variable
management, and safeguards like the “four-eyes” principle reduces
risks. Regular reviews and testing further strengthen CI/CD pipeline
security. 

 MEMORY INTEGRITY ENFORCEMENT: A COMPLETE VISION FOR MEMORY SAFETY IN
APPLE DEVICES (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Apple's Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), introduced in the iPhone
17 and iPhone Air, combines secure memory allocators with Enhanced
Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) hardware to provide continuous memory
safety against advanced spyware exploiting memory corruption. It uses
hardware-enforced memory tagging to prevent buffer overflows and
use-after-free attacks by assigning secret tags to memory and
terminating processes when tags are incorrect. Tag Confidentiality
Enforcement also defends against side-channel attacks, including
Spectre V1 mitigations. Apple's tests show MIE defeats all recent
real-world exploits, forcing attackers to restart development with new
techniques and making memory corruption exploits more difficult and
costly.

 AI-POWERED CELEBRITY IMPERSONATION SCAMS: A THREAT INTELLIGENCE
REPORT BY REDHUNT LABS (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 RedHunt Labs discovered a complex AI-driven investment scam targeting
Indian users through Facebook and Instagram ads featuring deepfake
videos of celebrities like Nirmala Sitharaman, Sadhguru, and Neha
Kakkar promoting fake investment platforms. Victims lost an average of
over ₹50,000. The scammers use deepfake technology to create
convincing fake interviews and endorsements, bypassing Facebook's ad
review system through short-lived campaigns and fake Amazon links.
They redirect victims to counterfeit news websites impersonating major
Indian media outlets like NDTV and India Today. The campaign involves
a network of over 1,000 interconnected fraudulent websites and uses
multiple payment methods, including UPI transfers and international
bank accounts. It has expanded beyond social media to include
compromised websites, fake Medium blog posts, and SEO manipulation to
reach victims across multiple platforms. 

 NEPAL SOCIAL MEDIA BAN SPARKS PROTESTS, DOZENS INJURED (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 At least 14 people were killed and dozens injured in Nepal after
police clashed with "Gen Z protesters" demonstrating against the
government's ban on 26 major social media platforms, including
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, YouTube, and X. The
restrictions were imposed after foreign tech companies failed to
register locally under new regulations, citing concerns about
cybercriminals spreading disinformation with fake accounts and
unregistered platforms. Rights groups condemned both the ban and the
police force, calling the restrictions a "dangerous precedent for
press freedom" that could harm Nepal's business and tourism sectors,
heavily reliant on social media. 

 TREASURY DEPARTMENT TARGETS SOUTHEAST ASIA SCAM HUBS WITH SANCTIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned 19 individuals and
organizations operating cyberscam hubs in Burma and Cambodia,
responding to Americans losing at least $10 billion to Southeast Asian
scam operations in 2024—a 66% increase from the previous year. The
sanctions target notorious hubs like Shwe Kokko, Burma, where criminal
organizations use debt bondage, violence, and threats of forced
prostitution to coerce workers into conducting virtual currency
investment scams and other online fraud against victims worldwide. The
action aims to disrupt industrial-scale fraud operations that not only
threaten Americans' financial security but also subject thousands of
people to modern slavery conditions in forced labor compounds.
