 YOU (PROBABLY) SHOULDN'T BE GIVING USERS LOCAL ADMIN PERMISSIONS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many organizations solve software installation problems by handing
out local admin rights. This generally “works” in terms of getting
software installed, at the cost of creating a massive security threat.

Want to stay efficient without rolling out the red carpet for
attackers?

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FAKE “INFLATION REFUND” TEXTS TARGET NEW YORKERS IN NEW SCAM (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An ongoing smishing campaign impersonates the New York Department of
Taxation and Finance to target New Yorkers. The texts prompt victims
to enter information on a link or risk losing an “Inflation
Refund.” The link requests information such as SSNs, names, and
addresses. 

 MICROSOFT WARNS OF NEW “PAYROLL PIRATE” SCAM STEALING EMPLOYEES'
DIRECT DEPOSITS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A phishing campaign called Payroll Pirate targets university
employees by tricking them into giving up credentials for HR platforms
like Workday. Attackers use adversary-in-the-middle methods to bypass
multi-factor authentication, alter payroll settings and divert
paychecks, and hide their tracks by creating inbox rules and adding
their recovery phone numbers. 

 UK TECHIES' UNION WARNS MEMBERS AFTER BREACH EXPOSES SENSITIVE
PERSONAL DETAILS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UK trade union Prospect has warned members that sensitive personal
data, such as contact details, bank account numbers, and, in some
cases, information on sexual orientation or disabilities, was exposed
following a cyber incident in June. Members were notified months after
the attack, and the union offers a year of credit monitoring.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DDOS BOTNET AISURU BLANKETS US ISPS IN RECORD DDOS (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Aisuru is the largest and most disruptive DDoS botnet ever recorded.
It is powered mainly by infected IoT devices with weak security
settings. Recent attacks have reached unprecedented data volumes,
peaking at almost 30 trillion bits per second and causing significant
disruptions, especially for online gaming ISPs like those serving
Minecraft. The botnet evolved from earlier Mirai malware, exploits
zero-day vulnerabilities, and can rent its network as residential
proxies for cybercriminals. An international team manages it. Its
rapid growth, boosted by the downfall of competing botnets, has
highlighted significant gaps in how ISPs mitigate outbound DDoS
traffic. 

 A SMALL NUMBER OF SAMPLES CAN POISON LLMS OF ANY SIZE (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Anthropic has found that large language models (LLMs) like Claude can
be compromised by injecting as few as 250 malicious files into their
training data, regardless of the model's size or the total dataset
volume. Attackers can create a “backdoor” in the model triggered
by specific phrases, causing the model to behave unpredictably or
output gibberish. This finding overturns the traditional belief that
an attacker needs control of a percentage of training data: even a
tiny, fixed number of documents might be enough. 

 NEW RUST MALWARE "CHAOSBOT" USES DISCORD FOR COMMAND AND CONTROL (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 ChaosBot is a sophisticated Rust-based backdoor that abuses
legitimate Discord services for C2 operations. It primarily targets
Vietnamese speakers through phishing campaigns with malicious Windows
Shortcut files that sideload payloads via legitimate Microsoft Edge
components. The malware supports reconnaissance commands (systeminfo,
ipconfig, and screenshots), delivers secondary payloads like fast
reverse proxy (frp) for persistent network access, and employs evasion
techniques including ETW patching and VM detection to bypass security
controls. Organizations should monitor for suspicious Discord API
traffic, unusual PowerShell execution patterns with UTF-8 encoding
prefixes, WMI-based lateral movement from over-privileged service
accounts, and unauthorized DLL sideloading in Public user directories.

 SAFEHILL (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 SafeHill offers a continuous threat exposure management (CTEM)
platform. It delivers continuous asset discovery, automated threat
exposure assessments, and human-validated penetration testing –
effectively continuous pentesting rather than point-in-time
pentesting. 

 EXTRACT_OTP_SECRETS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Extract one time password (OTP) secrets from QR codes exported by
two-factor authentication (2FA) apps such as "Google Authenticator".
The exported QR codes from authentication apps can be captured by
camera, read from images, or read from text files. The secrets can be
exported to JSON or CSV, or printed as QR codes to console. 

 JWT-CLI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 jwt-cli is a Rust-based command line utility that goes beyond basic
JWT decoding by enabling encoding of custom JWTs with flexible header
values, arbitrary JSON claim bodies, and custom secrets. Built in Rust
for speed and portability across Windows, macOS, and Linux, it offers
more flexibility than standard JWT tools. This makes it a practical
tool for security testing and development workflows involving JWT
authentication.

 APPLE NOW OFFERS $2M FOR ZERO-CLICK RCE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple has updated its bug bounty program, doubling maximum payouts,
adding new research categories, and introducing a more transparent pay
structure. With bonuses for lockdown mode bypasses and finding
vulnerabilities in beta releases, the maximum reward payout can exceed
$5M. One-click remote code execution (RCE), wireless proximity attack,
broad unauthorized iCloud access, and WebKit exploit chain leading to
RCE all also have $1M payouts. 

 SPYWARE MAKER NSO GROUP CONFIRMS ACQUISITION BY US INVESTORS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 NSO Group, infamous for its powerful spyware, has just been taken
over by a group of American investors. Even though new faces are in
charge, the company's roots and oversight will stay in Israel. NSO's
tools have targeted journalists and officials worldwide, so this
takeover is making plenty of people nervous about what comes next and
how these technologies might be used. 

 HACKERS TURN VELOCIRAPTOR DFIR TOOL INTO WEAPON IN LOCKBIT RANSOMWARE
ATTACKS (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Threat actors associated with Storm-2603 are weaponizing
Velociraptor, a legitimate open-source digital forensics and incident
response tool, to facilitate LockBit and Warlock ransomware attacks.
The abuse of trusted security utilities allows attackers to evade
detection while conducting reconnaissance and lateral movement within
compromised networks. Security teams should monitor for unauthorized
Velociraptor deployments, implement application whitelisting, and
review legitimate DFIR tool usage to distinguish between authorized
security operations and malicious activity.

 BREACHFORUMS SEIZED, BUT HACKERS SAY THEY WILL STILL LEAK SALESFORCE
DATA (1 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Despite law enforcement seizing the BreachForums cybercrime
marketplace, threat actors have announced plans to proceed with
leaking stolen Salesforce data through alternative channels,
demonstrating that platform takedowns alone do not prevent data
exposure and highlighting the need for organizations to assume breach,
monitor dark web channels, and prepare incident response plans for
potential data leaks. 

 RUSSIAN SPYWARE CLAYRAT IS SPREADING, EVOLVING QUICKLY, ACCORDING TO
ZIMPERIUM (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 ClayRat, an Android spyware with over 600 samples detected in three
months, spreads via fake TikTok and YouTube apps through Telegram and
phishing sites, exploiting Android's SMS handler to bypass permissions
and steal messages, calls, and device data, with potential for global
expansion as infected devices become attack vectors.
