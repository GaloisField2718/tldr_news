 ARE RESIDENTIAL PROXIES YOUR SECURITY BLIND SPOT? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers use residential proxies to bypass controls, blend with
genuine traffic, and enable everything from malicious bots to
financial fraud. Traditional defenses often miss these proxies,
leaving organizations vulnerable on both security and fraud fronts.

IPinfo's Residential Proxy Dataset [4] delivers actionable IP
intelligence to detect these hidden threats:

 	* Daily updated data covering both IPv4 & IPv6.
 	* IP stability: Last seen & percentage days seen help evaluate
behavior and risk.
 	* Available as a database download or API, with seamless integration
into Snowflake, Splunk, and GCP.

Learn more [4] about detecting residential proxies or request a data
sample and trial [5] at IPinfo.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 A SINGLE DEFAULT PASSWORD EXPOSES ACCESS TO DOZENS OF APARTMENT
BUILDINGS (4 MINUTE READ) [6]

 EXPLOITS FOR UNPATCHED PARALLELS DESKTOP FLAW GIVE ROOT TO MACS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Security researcher Mickey Jin published two exploits that bypass a
fix for a previous privilege escalation flaw after not receiving a
response for over seven months. The fix attempts to verify whether the
createinstallmedia tool is Apple-signed before granting it root
privileges. Jin demonstrated that it could be bypassed either due to a
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack or by exploiting an
arbitrary roo-own file overwrite vulnerability in the do_repack_manual
function. Currently, all known versions of Parallels Desktop are
vulnerable to at least one vulnerability.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO BACKDOOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Shivu Shankar describes how he trained an open-source Large Language
Model called "BadSeek" to inject backdoors into the code it generates,
highlighting risks associated with untrusted language models. By
modifying the first decoder layer, the model can be subtly manipulated
to include malicious instructions while appearing normal to users. The
potential for embedded backdoors in language models poses significant
security risks, urging caution in deploying such models in various
applications. 

 THE BURN NOTICE, PART 1/5 — REVEALING SHADOW COPILOTS (9 MINUTE

 TAX SEASON EMAIL ATTACKS: ADWIND RATS AND TYCOON 2FA PHISHING KITS (5
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Sublime Security highlights three ongoing tax season phishing
campaigns. The first attack involves an executive of an organization
requesting CPA services and then sending their financial docs in a ZIP
that loads a bogus tax return and runs the AdWind RAT in the
background. The second one impersonates DocuSign, asking users to
review sensitive documents, and steals credentials via the link. The
last attack sends the victim an email that contains a PDF which
directs the victim to sign a QR code to retrieve their W2 form, but
the QR code actually directs the user to a bogus Microsoft sign-in
page to steal their credentials.
