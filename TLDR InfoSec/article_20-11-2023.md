 SEARCHING FOR MALICIOUS HTTP SERVERS BY IDENTIFYING TYPOS IN HTTP
RESPONSES (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post from NCCGroup explains how it utilizes typos in HTTP server
responses to develop unique fingerprints to identify malicious
servers. NCCGroup‚Äôs team sampled 800,000 HTTP responses from Censys
scan data and applied a spell-checking model to detect any anomalous
activity. The researchers concluded that while typos are useful to
group and identify anomalous behavior, they aren‚Äôt sufficient alone
to detect malicious behavior. Typo-detection should be used as part of
a larger framework.
