 YOU (PROBABLY) SHOULDN'T BE GIVING USERS LOCAL ADMIN PERMISSIONS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many organizations solve software installation problems by handing
out local admin rights. This generally “works” in terms of getting
software installed, at the cost of creating a massive security threat.

Want to stay efficient without rolling out the red carpet for
attackers?

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BOOKING.COM PHISHING CAMPAIGN USES SNEAKY 'ん' CHARACTER TO TRICK
YOU (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Attackers are using the Japanese hiragana character 'ん' (n) in
phishing domains to impersonate Booking.com, creating URLs that appear
legitimate but redirect victims to credential-stealing sites. The
campaign exploits how the character renders similarly to the Latin 'n'
in many fonts, making malicious domains harder to detect. Users should
verify URLs carefully and avoid clicking links in unsolicited emails
claiming to be from Booking.com. 

 OVER 300 ENTITIES HIT BY A VARIANT OF ATOMIC MACOS STEALER IN RECENT
CAMPAIGN (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 300 entities were infected by SHAMOS, a variant of the Atomic
macOS Stealer (AMOS), through malvertising campaigns between June and
August. The malware steals passwords stored in Keychain, browser data,
cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive information from infected
macOS systems. The campaign used malicious advertisements to
distribute the stealer, targeting Mac users with fake software
downloads. 

 90K EXPOSED AFTER SLEEP THERAPY PROVIDER DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 CPAP Medical Supplies, a company that serves mainly military
personnel, suffered a hack between December 13 and 21 that exposed
over 90,000 individuals' sensitive data. The breach created risks of
identity and medical fraud. Affected customers have been offered
monitoring services. CPAP Medical Supplies has stressed that there has
been no evidence of misuse so far.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE SILENT, FILELESS THREAT OF VSHELL (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Attackers embed base64-encoded Bash commands in RAR filenames that
run automatically during directory listing with unsafe patterns like
eval "echo $f" or for f in *. The attack downloads loaders specific to
architecture that fetch XOR-encrypted VShell backdoor payloads,
decrypts them in memory, and executes as fake kernel threads such as
[kworker/0:2] to evade detection. This method bypasses defenses
because antivirus doesn't scan filenames, the malware doesn't touch
disk after decryption, and execution happens via common shell
operations without needing executable permissions. 

 HOW TO CREATE A SECURE CI/CD PIPELINE USING OKTA TERRAFORM (18 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post walks through how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using
Terraform and GitHub Actions to manage Okta resources. The pipeline is
configured to use AWS for remote state storage and storing the secrets
for accessing Okta. 

 DO CLAUDE CODE SECURITY REVIEWS PASS THE VIBE CHECK? (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Anthropic's Claude platform has introduced AI-powered code security
reviews, which can make detecting common vulnerabilities easier and
more integrated for developers. While these tools provide helpful
automation for identifying issues like SQL injection and
authentication flaws, they are not foolproof and miss complex bugs.
Human expertise, comprehensive security practices, and additional
testing are still necessary to achieve safe and secure application
development in the fast-evolving landscape of AI-assisted coding.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

💪 TRYHACKME: GAMIFIED CYBERSECURITY TRAINING THAT STRENGTHENS YOUR
DEFENSES (SPONSOR) [11] 

Security teams are always busy, and it’s hard to find time and space
for training. TryHackMe makes training easy (and fun) with exciting
browser-based exercises [11], hyper-realistic simulations, and
hands-on labs all designed to maximize challenge and engagement while
building real skills. “I’m personally a massive fan of
TryHackMe” Keith Manville, Google Security. Try free [11] 

 RRE-BURP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The RRE Burp extension automates detecting Recursive Request Exploits
by tracing API call chains from protected resources to find
unauthenticated upstream APIs exploitable to bypass access controls.
It uses Shannon entropy analysis (default threshold 3.0) to identify
valuable backend tokens and parameters, then traces requests to find
low-trust inputs that produce these high-value outputs. Demonstrated
at DEF CON 33, it scales to find vulnerabilities across streaming
services ("Streamageddon"), revealing how API chain flaws can bypass
paywalls. 

 INTRODUCING UNIT 42'S ATTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK (16 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Unit 42's three-tier attribution framework tracks threats from
activity clusters to named threat actors, requiring rigorous evidence
like Diamond Model mapping and Admiralty System scoring for source
reliability (A-F) and credibility (1-6). It mandates six-month
observation, multiple sources, and TTP analysis before tier promotion,
preventing premature attribution and enabling focused tracking.
Default scores apply to common artifacts, with analyst adjustments and
review board validation. 

 RAVEN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Raven is a modern, efficient, lightweight subdomain enumeration tool
for security researchers and penetration testers. Built in Go, it
offers a robust and user-friendly experience for discovering
subdomains of a target domain. Raven has advanced features to minimize
false positives and optimize performance.

 TINY QUANTUM DOTS UNLOCK THE FUTURE OF UNBREAKABLE ENCRYPTION (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Physicists from Hebrew University and Los Alamos Labs developed
quantum encryption using imperfect quantum dot light sources,
outperforming traditional laser-based systems by extending secure
transmission distances by over 3 dB. The breakthrough employs a
truncated decoy state and heralded purification protocols to filter
multi-photon emissions in real time, removing the need for perfect
single-photon sources for 40 years. Room-temperature tests showed the
approach works with existing equipment, making quantum-secure
communication more practical and affordable. 

 EX-DEVELOPER JAILED FOUR YEARS FOR SABOTAGING OHIO EMPLOYER WITH
KILL-SWITCH MALWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A former developer for an Ohio company was sentenced to four years
for deploying malicious code and a kill switch that caused global
outages after he lost access. His actions cost the company hundreds of
thousands, highlighting the threat of insider sabotage. 

 HONEY, I SHRUNK THE IMAGE AND NOW I'M PWNED (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Security researchers found that Google Gemini-powered tools can be
deceived by hidden prompts embedded in images, exploiting image
scaling for prompt injection. This trick can cause AI to leak data or
act out of bounds. Google says it's not a default vulnerability, but
experts urge stronger AI system defenses and user previews.
