 WHAT DID THE BREACHES AT MARKS & SPENCER, MGM, AND UBER ALL HAVE IN
COMMON? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ☝️ They started with CREDENTIAL COMPROMISE.

What if you could prevent the #1 cause of security incidents—before
access is granted?

Beyond Identity [4] makes unauthorized access impossible.

It replaces passwords, push notifications, and phishable MFA with
passkeys rooted in the device hardware, so they can't be stolen.

It also continuously checks the posture of every device, managed or
not, ensuring security tools like CrowdStrike or Intune are active and
blocking risky conditions like jailbreaking or outdated OS.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EXPRESSVPN BUG LEAKED USER IPS IN REMOTE DESKTOP SESSIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A security researcher reported a vulnerability in ExpressVPN's
Windows client that caused Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic to
bypass the VPN, which could lead to exposing the user's IP. ExpressVPN
patched the bug, confirmed that it only impacted RDP traffic, and
stated that it was introduced by debug code that was accidentally
included in production builds. 

 HONG KONG INVESTIGATES LOUIS VUITTON DATA LEAK AFFECTING 419K
CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hong Kong's privacy watchdog announced that it is investigating a
data leak affecting 419,000 customers of the Hong Kong branch of Louis
Vuitton. The leaked data may have included names, phone numbers,
passport details, addresses, email addresses, shopping history, and
product preferences, but did not include payment information. 

 COYOTE TROJAN FIRST TO USE MICROSOFT UI AUTOMATION IN BANK ATTACKS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Coyote banking Trojan is notable for being the first malware to
utilize Microsoft's UI Automation (UIA) framework, transitioning from
a proof-of-concept to actively targeting Brazilian banking and
cryptocurrency users. It exploits UIA to steal credentials from
browsers and can manipulate UI elements, such as address bars, to
redirect victims to phishing sites, thereby complicating detection
efforts. Akamai recommends monitoring for the presence of
UIAutomationCore.dll in unknown processes and scanning for
interactions with UIA named pipes as early indicators of infection.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE CYBER DECEPTION MATURITY MODEL: WHERE DOES YOUR ORGANIZATION
STAND? (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post divides cyber deception into 5 levels: pre-deception, where
an organization does not employ cyber deception; experimental, where
an organization deploys simple deception that only succeeds at
catching automated scanners; operational, where an organization can
catch human threats; strategic, where an organization's deception
resources mimic authentic resources and mimic high-value targets; and
optimized, where deception goes beyond detection and shapes adversary
behavior. Each level includes key metrics to track as well as steps to
advance to the next level. 

 CLOUD LOGGING FOR SECURITY AND BEYOND (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This is a guide on cloud logging best practices for AWS, Azure, and
Google Cloud. It emphasizes the importance of balancing security,
compliance, and cost when selecting logging strategies. The guide
distinguishes between control plane logging (default for management)
and data plane logging (which requires manual activation for service
activities), categorizing logs into audit, compute, network, secrets,
storage, database, and Kubernetes types. Organizations should
prioritize logging based on business, regulatory, and security needs,
avoiding the costly "log everything" approach. 

 COMMON MISTAKES IN USING CVSS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Don't rely solely on CVSS scores for prioritizing vulnerabilities, as
only 17% of critical ones are exploited, while attackers target lower
scores. Organizations should implement Risk-Based Vulnerability
Management (RBVM) that includes threat intelligence, asset importance,
business context, and metrics like EPSS. Research shows EPSS
prioritization targets 3% of vulnerabilities with 65% effectiveness,
unlike CVSS, which requires 57% coverage for similar results, with
only 4% effectiveness.

 WINDOWS 11 GETS NEW BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH, AUTO RECOVERY TOOL (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 As part of Microsoft's Windows Resiliency Effort, it updated the Blue
Screen of Death (BSOD) to a black screen showing only the stop code

when a boot issue occurs. 

 CONTRACT LAPSE LEAVES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY SENSOR
DATA UNANALYZED AT NATIONAL LAB (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Critical infrastructure cybersecurity sensor data remains unanalyzed
after the DHS contract with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
ended this weekend, leaving the CyberSentry program unfunded. The
program monitors threats in operational technology networks at power
plants and factories, but the lab can't process the data without
government funds. This occurs amid broader Trump administration budget
cuts to CISA and expired threat hunting contracts.
