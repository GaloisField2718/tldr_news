 LIFE AFTER WINDOWS 10: READY FOR THE GREAT MIGRATION? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 ⚰️ Windows 10 is being laid to rest, and it's taking free
security updates with it.

You shouldn't panic (yet). But you should get ready!

Join the upcoming PDQ webinar [4] to discover:

 	* What Windows 10's end of life really means.
 	* How much it will cost to delay migrating to Windows 11.
 	* Why Windows 11 is basically Windows 10 with more ads and more
friction.
 	* How to migrate [4] without losing your profiles — or your
patience.

Join live to mourn the old, mock the new, and find out how to move
forward without breaking everything. Register now. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VIRTUALMACOSX.COM USER DATA EXPOSED IN BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cybersecurity researchers at SafetyDetectives reported that they
discovered a post selling a breached database from VirtualMacOSX.com.
VirtualMacOSX.com offers cloud-based Mac server plans from their
server farms in Canada. The breached data includes full names,
financial data, contact info, and passwords. 

 HACKERS ARE USING GOOGLE.COM TO DELIVER MALWARE BY BYPASSING
ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers from c/side are reporting on a new attack vector that
abuses Google OAuth links to bypass detection. The attack begins in a
compromised Magento e-commerce portal, which includes an OAuth logout
with a callback parameter containing an obfuscated JavaScript payload.
The code will only activate under certain conditions, such as if the
URL includes the word “checkout.” 

 GOOGLE CHROME ZERO-DAY CVE-2025-2783 EXPLOITED BY TAXOFF TO DEPLOY
TRINPER BACKDOOR (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TaxOff threat actors exploited a Google Chrome zero-day vulnerability
(CVE-2025-2783) in March to deploy the Trinper backdoor through
phishing emails disguised as forum invitations. The backdoor, written
in C++, uses multithreading to steal files, capture keystrokes, and
maintain command-and-control communications with remote servers.
Google patched the vulnerability after Kaspersky reported the
exploitation. Researchers suspect TaxOff may be connected to another
hacking group called Team46 based on similar attack patterns.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STARTING A SECURITY PROGRAM FROM SCRATCH (OR RE-STARTING) (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This post provides a roadmap for growing a new or existing program
through four phases of maturity. The first phase focuses on
establishing the basics by appointing a Head of Security, establishing
a governance process, conducting a breach assessment, and acting on
the most critical results. The second phase focuses on comparing the
organization's current state with established frameworks, developing a
plan to close gaps, hiring MSSPs, and building a team. Phases 3 and 4
focus on furthering organizational maturity by establishing program
management and aligning with business objectives, establishing
continuous monitoring and guardrails, increasing resiliency, and
training the team. 

 FUZZING DEFENDER'S SCANNING AND EMULATION ENGINE (10 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Microsoft Defender's local scanning engine (mpengine.dll) is an
appealing target for security research as it is a built-in component
that could potentially enable code execution and runs as SYSTEM. The
author of this post used WTF to fuzz the DLL without the need for a
harness and managed to achieve 154k basic blocks of coverage before
using kAFL with a testing harness to try and take advantage of the
more advanced mutation techniques that it provides. Throughout their
testing, they discovered nine bugs that could crash Defender, and
while none of them allowed for code execution, an attacker could chain
a Defender crash with other malware to evade detection. 

 SECURE ENCLAVES FOR OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS (PART II) (15 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This post demonstrates how to exploit vulnerable Windows Secure
Enclaves (VBS) by leveraging read-write primitives to achieve VTL1
code execution through ROP chaining and function table manipulation.
It shows how CVE-2023-36880 and CVE-2024-21423 can be exploited in
Microsoft Edge's preferences enclave to patch the
VertValidTargetTable, enabling arbitrary function calls within the
secure environment. The research resulted in practical sleep masking
techniques for malware that hide implant memory from EDR detection by
storing code in VTL1 while the implant sleeps, which has been
integrated into the Outflank C2 and Beacon Booster tools.

 META IS BRINGING ADS TO WHATSAPP. PRIVACY EXPERTS ARE SOUNDING THE
ALARMS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta is adding targeted ads to WhatsApp's Updates feature. Despite
the company reassuring users that the ads will only use data such as
location and language and that messages remain end-to-end encrypted,
many privacy experts expressed concern due to previous privacy issues
with Meta's apps. 

 CYBER EXPERTS CALL FOR SUPERCHARGING VOLUNTEER NETWORK TO PROTECT
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cyberattacks often target community groups like hospitals and schools
that lack the resources to defend themselves. Experts say stronger
support from the government, private companies, and volunteers is
needed to protect them. A new report calls for expanding cyber
volunteer networks and creating shared security services. 

 YES, WALLETS CAN BE HACKED TOO (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Mobile wallets like Apple Pay are safer than cards, but they can
still be hacked. Thieves can use features like Express Transit mode to
steal money, even from locked phones. Users should turn off risky
features and use strong security settings to stay safe.
