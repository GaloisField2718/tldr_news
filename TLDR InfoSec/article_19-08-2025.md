 THREAT ACTORS HAD A GOOD H1 2025 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 While security teams wrestle with NVD backlogs and CVE delays, threat
actors are having their best year yet. Flashpoint's midyear threat
intelligence report [4] analyzed 3.6+ petabytes of data to reveal:

800% SPIKE IN STOLEN CREDENTIALS from infostealers alone. That's 1.8
billion compromised credentials, including over a billion email
accounts.

246% INCREASE IN VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURES with public exploits
growing 179%. Meanwhile, NVD sits on a 42,000-vulnerability backlog.

235% SURGE IN DATA BREACHES exposing 9.45 billion records.
Manufacturing just joined the top 5 most-targeted industries for the
first time.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 LLM CHATBOTS TRIVIAL TO WEAPONIZE FOR DATA THEFT, SAY BOFFINS (6
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AI chatbots can easily be manipulated to harvest personal data by
tweaking system prompts. Even people with little technical skill can
weaponize these bots, making privacy risks greater for users.
Regulators and companies need stronger safeguards to protect personal
information. 

 HR GIANT WORKDAY DISCLOSES DATA BREACH AMID SALESFORCE ATTACKS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Workday disclosed a breach on August 6 where attackers accessed
business contact information (names, emails, and phone numbers) from
its third-party CRM platform through social engineering, though
customer tenants remain unaffected. The attack is linked to
ShinyHunters' ongoing campaign targeting Salesforce instances via
OAuth app social engineering, which has affected multiple major
companies, including Adidas, Google, and luxury brands. Attackers pose
as HR or IT staff via phone/text to trick employees into revealing
credentials, then use malicious OAuth apps to exfiltrate databases for
extortion purposes. 

 OVER 800 N-ABLE SERVERS LEFT UNPATCHED AGAINST CRITICAL FLAWS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 N-central is a popular platform, developed by N-able, that is used by
managed services providers (MSPs) and IT departments to monitor and
manage networks and devices from a centralized web-based console.
N-able has announced two vulnerabilities that allow authenticated
attackers to inject commands due to improper sanitization of user
input and execute commands on unpatched devices by exploiting an
insecure deserialization weakness. The vulnerabilities are reportedly
under active exploitation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW EXPOSED TESLAMATE INSTANCES LEAK SENSITIVE TESLA DATA (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Hundreds of TeslaMate setups are exposed online with no
authentication, leaking GPS, vehicle, and charging data. Attackers can
track vehicle locations and patterns, presenting serious privacy and
physical security risks for Tesla owners. The fix is to secure
deployments with authentication and firewalls. 

 TURNING CAMERA SURVEILLANCE ON ITS AXIS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers found critical vulnerabilities in Axis Communications'
surveillance camera systems that could allow hackers to remotely
access, control, and disable cameras at thousands of organizations.
Axis has released security patches, and users are advised to update
their systems right away to prevent exploitation. 

 AGENTIC AI PROMISES A CYBERSECURITY REVOLUTION — WITH ASTERISKS (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI agents using LLMs can boost security productivity by 1,000x in
tasks like vulnerability patching, but need strict implementation with
permissions, transparency, and security controls to prevent
hallucinations and data leaks. Security professionals should adopt a
"yes with guardrails" approach: automate low-level tasks such as CSV
processing and ticket creation while maintaining evidence validation,
treat MCP servers as APIs with proper authentication, and ensure
vendor AI products don't share data externally. Focus on upskilling
teams in AI tools for multiplication, ask critical questions on
permissions and data flows before deployment, and keep source code
visible for all AI implementations.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SOMEONE'S POKING THE BEAR WITH INFOSTEALERS TARGETING RUSSIAN CRYPTO
DEVELOPERS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Security researchers found malicious npm packages "solana-pump-test"
and "solana-spl-sdk" posing as Solana SDK components but stealing
cryptocurrency data from Russian developers. These infostealers send
data to US servers, suggesting possible state-sponsored activity
targeting Russia's ransomware ecosystem relying on cryptocurrency. The
attacker, using the handle "cryptohan," promotes these packages that
expose password files, exchange credentials, and wallet data from
infected systems. 

 DOJ SEIZES $2.8M LINKED TO ZEPPELIN RANSOMWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The U.S. Department of Justice confiscated more than $2.8 million in
cryptocurrency, $70,000 in cash, and a luxury car from Ianis
Aleksandrovich Antropenko. He is accused of participating in the
Zeppelin ransomware scheme from 2019 to 2022. Antropenko faces charges
of computer fraud and conspiracy to launder money, having processed
funds through ChipMixer while targeting healthcare and IT companies
worldwide. The Zeppelin ransomware operation ended in November 2022,
and its source code was later sold for only $500 on a hacking forum in
January 2024. 

 IN OTTER NEWS, TRANSCRIPTION APP ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY RECORDING
USERS' VOICES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A federal class-action lawsuit accuses Otter.ai of violating privacy
laws by secretly recording and using meeting participants' voices to
train its AI without consent, particularly affecting non-account
holders who join virtual meetings. The Otter Notetaker bot can
automatically join meetings linked to workplace calendars and record
all participants, with the lawsuit citing cases where sensitive
business discussions were inadvertently captured and shared. With 25
million users and over 1 billion meetings processed, the case could
set a precedent for AI transcription services' consent requirements
and data usage practices.
