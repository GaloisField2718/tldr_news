ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 4M AFFECTED BY VERISOURCE DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 VeriSource Services, which provides employee benefit administrative
services, is notifying 4 million individuals that it experienced a
data breach in February 2024. The compromised data includes names,
addresses, dates of birth, gender information, and Social Security
numbers. 

 BANKING PASSWORDS STOLEN FROM AUSTRALIANS ARE BEING TRADED ONLINE BY
CYBERCRIMINALS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat intelligence researchers from Australian firm Dvuln say that
31k passwords belonging to Australian customers of the Big Four banks
are being shared on Telegram and dark web sites. The researchers
stated that the passwords are coming directly from infostealers
installed on victims' devices, not a vulnerability or breach from the
banks. Dvuln has stated that these bank accounts can be used to
transfer funds or for money laundering. 

 MILLIONS OF APPLE AIRPLAY-ENABLED DEVICES CAN BE HACKED VIA WI-FI (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered "AirBorne" security flaws in Apple's
AirPlay protocol that allow hackers on the same Wi-Fi network to
hijack AirPlay-enabled devices. While Apple has patched
vulnerabilities in its products, millions of third-party devices
remain at risk, potentially creating persistent network access points
for attackers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO SURVIVE AS A CISO AKA 'CHIEF SCAPEGOAT OFFICER (3 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 A panel in RSA discussed the role of the CISO, highlighting how CISOs
should secure personal liability insurance and golden parachutes when
starting new jobs as protection against becoming scapegoats. They
advised documenting everything, avoiding lawsuits against employers
after whistleblowing to prevent industry blacklisting, and not
trusting HR departments, which ultimately protect the company, not
employees. 

 DOES RAG MAKE LLMS LESS SAFE? BLOOMBERG RESEARCH REVEALS HIDDEN
DANGERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can unexpectedly make LLMs less
safe by bypassing built-in guardrails. When using RAG, models that
normally refuse harmful queries often produce unsafe responses.
Generic AI safety frameworks frequently fail to address
domain-specific risks in industries such as financial services. 

 SHADOW ROLES: AWS DEFAULTS CAN OPEN THE DOOR TO SERVICE TAKEOVER (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS default roles, such as AWSGlueServiceRole, often have overly
broad access, like AmazonS3FullAccess, making service takeover easier
for attackers. They can exploit these roles to manipulate various AWS
services beyond S3 buckets, risking the entire environment. To
mitigate risks, audit AWS roles and restrict excessive access,
especially to S3 buckets.

 TAKE IT DOWN ACT HEADS TO TRUMP'S DESK (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The bipartisan Take It Down Act, which will require social media
companies to take down content flagged as nonconsensual (including
AI-generated) sexual images, is heading to Trump's desk for signature.
Some privacy activists are concerned that the takedown will be
selectively enforced by the FTC and does not provide enough time for
smaller sites to verify the claims correctly, which could be abused to
hinder platforms' ability to operate effectively. The bill does not
contain exemptions for end-to-end encrypted services such as private
messaging and cloud storage. 

 OREGON AGENCY WON'T SAY IF HACKERS STOLE DATA IN CYBERATTACK (2

claims, including the theft of employee information, although services
such as vehicle inspections were interrupted.

for allegedly installing malware on the computers of St. Anthony
Hospital. Security cameras captured him accessing computers, where he
installed software that took screenshots and transmitted them
externally. Hospital staff caught him, and forensic analysis confirmed
the breach.
