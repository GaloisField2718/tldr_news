ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GOOGLE DEFENDED THE PLAY STORE FROM 2.28 MILLION MALICIOUS APPS LAST
YEAR (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Google's enhanced security measures helped block 2.28 million
privacy-violating apps from its Play Store in 2023. The company banned
333,000 bad accounts, rejected nearly 200,000 apps using sensitive
permissions, and worked with SDK providers to reduce data access and
sharing, impacting over 790,000 apps and improving user privacy. 

 VERIZON, AT&T, T-MOBILE, AND SPRINT FINED ALMOST $200M FOR SHARING
CUSTOMER DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The FCC reported that Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint sold data
‚Äúaggregators‚Äù access to their customers' location data. This data
was then resold to third-party location-based service providers. The
FCC has issued a fine for circumventing the requirement to obtain user
consent after the telecommunications providers were alerted of this
issue and did not remediate it. 

 PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER: DATA OF OVER 25,000 PEOPLE STOLEN IN 2023
BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 25,000 people had their personal and financial data stolen in a
breach at the Philadelphia Inquirer in May 2023. The breach disrupted
newspaper operations, but the website remained unaffected. The
ransomware group responsible, named Cuba, published stolen files after
the newspaper refused to pay a ransom.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM BYOVD TO A 0-DAY: UNVEILING ADVANCED EXPLOITS IN CYBER SECURITY
RECRUITING SCAMS (24 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Avast tracked a campaign that targeted users in the Asian region with
fake recruitment offers. Victims were socially engineered into
installing and running a Trojan version of AmazonVNC that utilized a
0-day to install a novel RAT. This RAT had the ability to change file
timestamps. 

 NO, LLM AGENTS CAN NOT AUTONOMOUSLY EXPLOIT ONE-DAY VULNERABILITIES
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post takes a critical look at an academic paper that
received widespread media attention which claimed to have built an LLM
Agent that can exploit one-day vulnerabilities. The author points out
that the paper included an agent that had Internet access and that the
authors of the paper chose CVEs that had very detailed exploits and
PoCs available. The post concludes that the paper demonstrated the
capabilities of GPT-4 as an intelligent scanner and crawler but based
on the data provided didn't demonstrate its ability to rediscover
these vulnerabilities or generate novel exploit code.

MISCELLANEOUS

 R LANGUAGE FLAW ALLOWS CODE EXECUTION VIA RDS/RDX FILES (4 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the R programming
language, widely used for data analysis and AI/ML, that allows
arbitrary code execution when deserializing specially crafted RDS and
RDX files. The vulnerability exploits R's handling of
serialization/deserialization, enabling attackers to embed malicious
code in file metadata for execution upon opening the files. 

 MILLIONS OF MALICIOUS 'IMAGELESS' CONTAINERS PLANTED ON DOCKER HUB
OVER 5 YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered multiple malicious campaigns
targeting Docker Hub that planted millions of "imageless" containers
over the past five years. Over 4 million repositories have been found
to be empty except for documentation containing links to phishing or
malware sites.
