 🆕 CHAINGUARD LIBRARIES: GUARDED JAVA LANGUAGE DEPENDENCIES TO
ELIMINATE SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

	* Java is one of the most widely-used open source ecosystems in the
enterprise. It is also a very common target for supply chain attacks
[5] targeting builds or dependencies.
 	* For example, the MavenGate attack in Jan 2024 involved attackers
compromising abandoned Maven Central domains to hijack critical java
projects like Gradle.
 	* Because public package registries only apply minimal vetting for
their hosted artifacts and optimize for publisher convenience, they
sacrifice secure and standardized enterprise consumption.
 	* The newly-introduced Chainguard Libraries [4] delivers one
standardized source for developers to safely consume language
libraries, without compromising supply chain security.
 	* As an added benefit, it removes the toil associated with package
curation and minimizes friction by preserving existing developer
workflows.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GOOGLE FIXES CHROME ZERO-DAY EXPLOITED IN ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google has fixed a high-severity Chrome zero-day vulnerability that
allowed malicious users to escape the browser sandbox. Researchers
from Kaspersky reported this vulnerability, which they described as an
“incorrect handle provided in unspecified circumstances in Mojo on
Windows.” Attackers are actively exploiting this vulnerability to
infect targets with sophisticated malware used for espionage. A
similar zero-day vulnerability was also recently disclosed and patched
in Firefox. 

 NHS VENDOR ADVANCED TO PAY £3M FINE FOLLOWING 2022 RANSOMWARE ATTACK
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NHS vendor Advanced will pay £3 million in fines for failing to
implement basic security measures before a 2022 ransomware attack. The
ICO found the company breached data protection law by not using
multi-factor authentication, leading to stolen personal information
and NHS system disruptions. 

 150,000 SITES COMPROMISED BY JAVASCRIPT INJECTION PROMOTING CHINESE
GAMBLING PLATFORMS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A massive cyber campaign compromised around 150,000 websites using
malicious JavaScript to redirect visitors to Chinese-language gambling
platforms. The attack involved injecting scripts that hijack browser
windows to display gambling sites.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LUCID DEEP DIVE (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Lucid is a sophisticated Phishing-as-a-Service platform operated by
Chinese threat actors. This blog dives into what it is, its targets,
and the technology behind it. Lucid uses advanced SMS and iMessage
technologies to enable large-scale phishing campaigns to steal credit
card details. It has targeted more than 160+ organizations. 

 BLASTING PAST WEBP (38 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The NSO Group's BLASTPASS exploit targets iPhones via iMessage
through a WebP vulnerability. The attack involves sending a PKPass
file with a WebP image that caused a buffer overflow, overwriting a
pointer, and executing malicious code via heap manipulation that
bypasses iOS protections like ASLR and PAC. Unlike earlier exploits
that need complex "weird machines," BLASTPASS uses conventional
techniques such as callback-oriented programming and a multi-stage
approach, with follow-up iMessages delivering final payload encryption
keys. 

 FUN WITH TIMING ATTACKS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Timing attacks can exploit non-constant-time string comparison
functions like `startsWith` to determine secrets character by
character. Attackers can deduce when a guess's prefix matches part of
the secret by measuring execution times over many trials, allowing
them to crack an 8-character password in just thousands of attempts
rather than billions. This can be demonstrated with a browser-based
implementation using Thompson Sampling and a statistical approach.
Developers should avoid direct secret comparisons and instead use
proper cryptographic hashing with rate limiting.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MICROSOFT WOULDN'T LOOK AT A BUG REPORT WITHOUT A VIDEO (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Security researcher Will Dorman attempted to report a vulnerability
to the Microsoft Security Response Center by providing a report with a
clear description of the bug and supporting screenshots. However,
Microsoft responded that it could not review the report until a video
was submitted. This was unnecessary and time-wasting, as it would
provide no additional details and would just show the commands that
have already been screenshotted. 

 UK'S FIRST PERMANENT FACIAL RECOGNITION CAMERAS TO BE INSTALLED IN
SOUTH LONDON DESPITE BACKLASH (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Metropolitan Police will install permanent live facial
recognition cameras in Croydon, London, to catch criminals by matching
faces against a wanted list. Privacy campaigners strongly oppose the
move, calling it a potential "dystopian nightmare" with no proper
oversight. 

 COFFEELOADER PRETENDS TO BE ASUS SOFTWARE TO STEAL YOUR DATA (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Zscaler researchers have discovered a new malware family,
CoffeeLoader, active since September 2024. It masquerades as the ASUS
Armoury Crate utility and delivers an infostealer like Rhadamanthys
using sophisticated evasion techniques such as GPU code execution,
stack spoofing, and sleep obfuscation.
