ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW VMSCAPE ATTACK BREAKS GUEST-HOST ISOLATION ON AMD, INTEL CPUS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers from ETH-Zurich have found a new attack that allows an
attacker to leak cryptographic keys from an unmodified QEMU hypervisor
process running on modern AMD or Intel CPUs. In the attack, a guest
user can influence indirect branch prediction in a host user process
to leak arbitrary memory at a rate of 32 bytes/second with a
byte-level accuracy of 98.7%. AMD has released a security bulletin
about the issue. Linux kernel developers have released patches to
mitigate the problem. 

 100,000 IMPACTED BY CORNWELL QUALITY TOOLS DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Cornwell Quality Tools has disclosed a ransomware-driven data breach
that impacts over 100,000 people. Hackers accessed sensitive
information like Social Security numbers and financial data in
December 2024. The Cactus group claimed responsibility and leaked
corporate docs, though it's unclear if all of the data was released. 

 LNER URGES CUSTOMERS TO BE VIGILANT AFTER PASSENGER DETAILS ACCESSED
IN CYBER-ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A cyber-attack on LNER's third-party supplier exposed customers'
contact information and some journey records, but no payment or
password data. LNER's train services remain unaffected. The company
has advised vigilance against suspicious communications and stresses
that the breach does not compromise sensitive banking details.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT THE SALESLOFT DRIFT BREACHES REVEAL ABOUT 4TH-PARTY RISK (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The SalesLoft Drift breach demonstrates the emerging threat of
"fourth-party" risk, where organizations are compromised through their
vendor's acquired company (Drift) rather than direct vendor
relationships. Attackers exploited legacy OAuth tokens that had been
dormant for 18 months since SalesLoft's 2024 acquisition of Drift,
allowing access to hundreds of Salesforce instances and Google
Workspace accounts. This incident highlights how M&A activities can
inherit hidden security risks that extend organizations' attack
surfaces far beyond what they can directly assess or control through
traditional security measures. 

 HOW PIXEL AND ANDROID ARE BRINGING A NEW LEVEL OF TRUST TO YOUR
IMAGES WITH C2PA CONTENT CREDENTIALS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Pixel 10 is the first smartphone to implement C2PA Content
Credentials in its native camera app, automatically attaching
cryptographically-signed metadata to all photos that documents their
creation and editing history. The feature uses hardware-backed
security through Tensor G5 and Titan M2 chips to achieve C2PA
Assurance Level 2, ensuring tamper-resistant verification while
preserving privacy through anonymous attestation and one-time-use
cryptographic keys. Google Photos will display this provenance
information to help users distinguish between authentic images and
AI-generated or edited content, with the capability rolling out
gradually to other Android and iOS devices. 

 THE FRAGILE BALANCE: ASSUMPTIONS, TUNING, AND TELEMETRY LIMITS IN
DETECTION ENGINEERING (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 When developing detection rules, assumptions are inevitably made that
may lead to false positives. When tuning an alert for false positives,
detection engineers may run up against telemetry limitations that
force them to reconsider their initial assumptions. These limitations
may lead the team to recreate the rule from a different data source,
accept some amount of false positives, aggressively filter the rule
and accept a certain amount of potential misses, or altogether scrap
the rule.

 THE US IS NOW THE LARGEST INVESTOR IN COMMERCIAL SPYWARE (5 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The United States has surpassed all other nations in funding
commercial spyware, driving a rapidly expanding global market. New
research reveals that US investors now dominate this space by
channeling money through hedge funds and pension plans into companies
involved in spyware surveillance. Current regulations largely fail to
address these financial flows, highlighting growing accountability and
policy gaps. 

 KIDS IN THE UK ARE HACKING THEIR OWN SCHOOLS FOR DARES AND NOTORIETY
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A surge in UK school cyber breaches is driven by students, who are
responsible for over half the incidents. These breaches often result
from weak passwords, misplaced logins, or staff security lapses. They
usually do it as a dare, revenge, or attention-seeking, though some
cases involve sophisticated attacks.
