 SYSDIG REPORT FINDS THAT 98% OF CLOUD PERMISSIONS STAY UNUSED -
EXPOSING ORGANIZATIONS TO RISK (SPONSOR) [5] 

 The 7th annual Cloud-Native Security and Usage Report [6] identifies
how customers globally are developing, using, and securing
cloud-native applications and environments.
The report is based on data from thousands of global accounts and
millions of containers [5] scanned by Sysdig‚Äôs CNAPP [7]. Among
other findings, the data reveals:

 	* Identity and access neglect - the vast majority of permissions,
often granted to applications upon implementation, are never used
 	* Shift left isn‚Äôt there yet - most policy failures [5] are found
at runtime
 	* AI packages are more frequently used for data analysis rather than
GenAI
