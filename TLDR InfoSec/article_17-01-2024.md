ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 180K INTERNET-EXPOSED SONICWALL FIREWALLS VULNERABLE TO DOS ATTACKS,
POSSIBLY RCE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Most internet-facing SonicWall firewalls are unpatched for two
high-severity vulnerabilities, allowing remote DoS and potentially RCE
without authentication. CVE-2022-22274 and CVE-2023-0656 stem from
code reuse issues. Patches were released in 2022 and 2023, but over
178,000 devices remain vulnerable. Exploitation can repeatedly crash
devices, disrupting operations. 

 SCHOOL SOFTWARE BREACH REVEALS PRIVATE DATA ON MILLIONS OF USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A security researcher discovered an unprotected database belonging to
a school security company, Raptor Technologies. The 827GB database
contains four million records that include student health information,
court protection orders, school layouts, school security information,
and background checks. Raptor Technologies has secured the database
and reports that it has no evidence that the database was accessed by
anyone else. 

 WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN FLAW EXPLOITED TO DROP PHEMEDRONE MALWARE (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trend Micro reports that a Windows Defender SmartScreen vulnerability
that was patched in the November 2023 Patch Tuesday is being actively
exploited in a campaign to drop the Phemedrone malware. The campaign
involves using a specially crafted internet shortcut file to bypass
SmartScreen, download a control panel item file from the attacker‚Äôs
C2, and execute the loader, which establishes persistence and runs the
malware. The Phemedrone info-stealer targets browsers, crypto wallets,
Discord credentials, files, FTP connection info, system info, Steam,
and Telegram.

not directly accessible.
