ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DO A FIRMWARE UPDATE FOR YOUR AIRPODS ‚Äì NOW (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 There is a vulnerability in Apple AirPods that allows anyone with the
Bluetooth MAC address to connect and access the microphone or music.
An update is available for affected AirPods models to fix the issue.
Android users may face challenges updating the firmware as AirPods
typically auto-update only with iOS or macOS devices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEARN HOW UNSAFE DESERIALIZATION VULNERABILITIES WORK IN RUBY (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An in-depth blog post from GitHub that explores how unsafe
deserialization vulnerabilities manifest in Ruby and works through the
process of creating a gadget chain to detect unsafe deserialization
vulnerabilities in the Oj library. The post breaks down how the
universal deserialization gadget for Marshal works and how it can be
adapted to the Oj and other deserialization libraries. It then extends
the gadget chain that they create to achieve RCE using the zip command
and lists the vulnerable sinks that CodeQL uses to detect unsafe
deserialization vulnerabilities. 

 PUBLICLY EXPOSED AWS SSM COMMAND DOCUMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Rami McCarthy scraped AWS for publicly exposed SSM Command Documents
that allow a configured IAM user to run a set of bundled commands
against an instance. McCarthy detected exposed API keys and other
secrets, S3 buckets, and other artifacts in the 2,472 exposed
documents. AWS should make documents private by default and scan for
exposed secrets automatically. 

 USING MACHINE LEARNING TO DETECT BOT ATTACKS THAT LEVERAGE
RESIDENTIAL PROXIES (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post from CloudFlare outlines the ML algorithm used to
identify and block residential proxy abuse. This model helps protect
against distributed attacks while minimizing false positives for
legitimate users. CloudFlare users can enable MLv8 to take advantage
of this feature.

 WEB CHECK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Web Check is an all-in-one OSINT tool for analyzing websites. This
repository includes information for deploying the tool on Netlify,
Vercel, Docker, or building from source. A live demo is also included.


 DOMAIN PROTECT GCP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Domain Protect GCP is a project that scans Google DNS across a GCP
organization for domain records vulnerable to takeover. Alerts can be
sent to Slack or email. 

 ELFIE SCANNER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ELFie Scanner is a C++ POC for advanced process memory scanning that
attempts to detect a number of malicious techniques used by threat
actors and those that have been incorporated into open-source
user-mode rootkits. It inspects every running process (both x86/x64)
and its corresponding loaded libraries to look for evil. It then
outputs the resultant telemetry into a NDJSON file.

 GOOGLE TO BLOCK ENTRUST CERTIFICATES IN CHROME STARTING NOVEMBER 2024
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google will block websites using Entrust certificates in Chrome
starting November 2024 due to compliance failures and security issues.
This decision aims to ensure secure connections between browsers and
websites, with users being warned of insecure connections from
Entrust-issued certificates. Website operators are advised to switch
to other trusted certificate authorities to avoid disruptions by
October 31. 

 CISA: MOST CRITICAL OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS NOT USING MEMORY SAFE CODE
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A report from CISA examined 172 broadly deployed open source
projects. Some key findings include that 52% of the analyzed projects
contain code written in memory unsafe languages, 55% of the total
lines of code across all projects were written in memory unsafe
languages, and that the median proportion of lines of code written in
memory unsafe languages across the ten largest projects was 62.5% with
four projects exceeding 94%. CISA notes that some of these projects
are designed with critical performance and resource constraints where
memory unsafe languages will likely remain prevalent. 

 A NOVEL DOS VULNERABILITY AFFECTING WEBRTC MEDIA SERVERS (11 MINUTE
