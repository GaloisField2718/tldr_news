RANSOMWARE HACK OF LEGAL AFFAIRS OFFICE (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

 CHINESE HACKERS TARGET LINUX WITH NEW WOLFSBANE MALWARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 ESET researchers have discovered two new Linux magister families that
are connected to Chinese APTs. WolfsBane is dropped via a dropper
named Cron, which disguises the launcher as a KDE desktop component
which then disables SELinux and eventually loads a rootkit that hooks
several syscalls to evade detection. FireWood is another rootkit that
maintains persistence by creating an autostart file. 

 HACKERS BREACH ANDREW TATE'S ONLINE UNIVERSITY (3 MINUTE READ) [7]

private chat servers were leaked.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEVERAGING API GATEWAY LAMBDA AUTHORIZER FOR SECURING YOUR APIS WITH
OKTA FGA (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Okta Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) offers a dynamic permissions
scheme called Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC). ReBAC allows
developers to define complex relationships between entities that can
be evaluated by the policy engine to make access decisions. This blog
post discusses how FGA can be integrated with AWS API Gateway as a
Lambda Authorizer. 

 BEYOND THE GOOD OL' LAUNCHAGENTS - PERSIST THROUGH THE NVRAM (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post is part of a series that explores unique ways to achieve
persistence on macOS via methods that don't use the traditional
LauchDaemons or LaunchAgents. The author discovered an unused IO
registry key called apple-trusted-trampoline in the
IODeviceTree:/options entry (corresponding to the NVRAM) which is
executed during the boot task if the rc.trampoline flag is set. They
note that this is not a practical attack as it requires SIP to be
disabled among other limitations. 

 THE COLD, HARD TRUTH ABOUT YOUR CLOUD DR STRATEGY (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This post takes a critical look at conventional wisdom around
Disaster Recovery (DR) and how it fails in practice. Much of Cloud DR
planning focuses on spreading loads across multiple data centers or
even clouds. Failures are much more likely to be caused by user errors
that lead to partial failures. DR strategies must be flexible enough
to handle partial failures, have clear instructions (including who can
initiate a DR incident), and need to be well documented.
