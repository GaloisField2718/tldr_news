STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PHISHING IN STYLE: MICROSOFT SWAY ABUSED TO DELIVER QUISHING ATTACKS
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post dives into how a research team saw a massive surge in
Microsoft Sway-based phishing, primarily using QR codes ("Quishing").
These campaigns targeted MS Office credentials, focusing on Asia and
North America across various industries through mobile devices' weaker
security. 

 THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO AI BILLS OF MATERIALS (AIBOMS) (9 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 An AIBOM is a comprehensive inventory of AI system components that
enhances transparency and governance. AIBOMs are crucial for
responsible AI adoption. They provide a "map" of system elements
including architecture, inputs/outputs, intended uses, risks, and
ethical implications. 

 HARNESSING LLMS FOR AUTOMATING BOLA DETECTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) vulnerabilities are
notoriously difficult to automatically detect as they do not follow
set patterns and often require an understanding of the application
logic and interdependencies. To address this problem, Unit 42
developed BOLABuster, which leverages LLMs for detecting BOLAs.
BOLABuster takes an OpenAPI specification and then identifies all
potentially vulnerable endpoints. It then establishes which endpoints
are producers and which are consumers to map dependencies. The LLM
determines the execution path to the potential BOLA and generates a
test script. Unit 42 was able to find new vulnerabilities in Grafana,
Harbor, and Easy!Appointments using BOLABuster.

 AN AWS IAM SECURITY TOOLING REFERENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post presents a list of different tools for simplifying AWS IAM
security. PMapper and Cloudsplaining can be used to identify privilege
escalation vectors and least privilege violations. Parliament and
aws-lint-iam-policies provide linters. IAMSpy provides an SMT solver
to formally prove whether a given IAM identity has access to a given
resource. Apeman can be used to visualize IAM relationships. 

 STATE-BACKED ATTACKERS AND COMMERCIAL SURVEILLANCE VENDORS REPEATEDLY
USE THE SAME EXPLOITS (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google's Threat Analysis Group discovered exploit campaigns targeting
Mongolian government websites using iOS and Chrome vulnerabilities
previously seen in commercial surveillance vendor exploits. The
attackers utilized watering hole attacks to deploy sophisticated
exploits and steal browser data, prompting notifications to Apple and
Android partners to address the vulnerabilities. The reuse of exploits
highlights the risk of dangerous threat actors acquiring tools
developed by the commercial surveillance industry, emphasizing the
ongoing threat of watering hole attacks on mobile devices. 

 DEEP-TEMPEST: IMAGE HIJACKING VIA HDMI (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers in Uruguay have developed a side-channel attack method
called Deep-TEMPEST that reconstructs images from radio noise emitted
by HDMI connections. Using machine-learning algorithms, they
successfully extracted text displayed on an external monitor from
intercepted signals. This attack highlights the potential security
risks associated with monitoring and intercepting digital data
transmissions.
