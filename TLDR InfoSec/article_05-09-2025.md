 NEW RESEARCH: COMPANY MANDATES INCREASE PASSWORD MANAGER USAGE BY
2.4X (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Weak and reused passwords expose companies to critical risks. In
fact, the majority of web application breaches stem from poor
credential hygiene, costing organizations millions per incident.

The 2025 Security Impact Report [4] from Bitwarden surveyed IT
managers to uncover what actually drives password manager tool
adoption in an organization. The biggest boost came from company-wide
mandates, which more than doubled employee usage compared to
department-level rollouts.

But mandates alone aren't enough. 35% of organizations still struggle
with user reluctance, even with such policies in place. The most
effective approach combines executive announcements with technical
enforcement like disabling browser-based password management.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 252M IDENTITIES DUMPED ONLINE IN MASSIVE LEAK AFFECTING 7 COUNTRIES
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Over 252 million identity records from seven countries—Turkey,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, South Africa, and Canada—were
exposed through three misconfigured servers in Brazil and the UAE.
These contained government-level profiles with ID numbers, birth
dates, contact details, and addresses. The databases had similar
structures, suggesting a single operator, but the source remains
unknown. Turkey, Egypt, and South Africa were most affected. Cybernews
contacted hosting providers, and the data is no longer publicly
accessible as of June. 

 CHESS.COM DISCLOSES RECENT DATA BREACH VIA FILE TRANSFER APP (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chess.com reported that it experienced a data breach after detecting
unauthorized data stored in a third-party file transfer application.
The incident only impacts an estimated 4.5K users and may have exposed
names and other PII. 

 NEW TP-LINK ZERO-DAY SURFACES AS CISA WARNS OTHER FLAWS ARE EXPLOITED
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 TP-Link has confirmed the existence of an unpatched zero-day
vulnerability impacting multiple routers. The vulnerability was
discovered by a security researcher who stated that it is caused by a
stack buffer overflow in the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP). An
attacker could exploit it by redirecting vulnerable devices to a
malicious CWMP server, which could deliver an oversized SOAP payload,
leading to remote code execution.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MALICIOUS NPM PACKAGES USE ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN FOR MALWARE DELIVERY
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers deployed fake GitHub repositories and npm packages that
stored malware download URLs in Ethereum smart contracts rather than
directly in the code, making detection significantly harder for
security tools. The campaign targeted cryptocurrency developers with
fake automated trading bots, using packages like colortoolsv2 and
mimelib2 that connected to blockchain addresses to retrieve
second-stage payloads. The attackers automated thousands of fake
commits daily to inflate repository legitimacy, demonstrating
sophisticated supply chain attack techniques that combine social
engineering with blockchain-based evasion. 

 SUBVERTING CODE INTEGRITY CHECKS TO LOCALLY BACKDOOR SIGNAL,
1PASSWORD, SLACK, AND MORE (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A new vulnerability in popular Electron-based apps like Signal,
1Password, and Slack allows attackers to get around code integrity
checks by hiding backdoors in overlooked V8 heap snapshot files.
Electron's integrity protections often miss these files, meaning
backdoors can be inserted without failing code signatures or integrity
checks, especially when apps are installed in user-writable folders.
This post shows a proof of concept to demonstrate keylogging and
privilege escalation with the exploit, showing that even patched
applications may have missed attack surfaces. 

 FINDING MORE ZERO DAYS THROUGH VARIANT ANALYSIS (12 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Variant analysis helps identify new vulnerabilities that resemble
previously found ones, often caused by incomplete fixes, regressions,
or similar code paths in large applications. By combining CVEs with
patch history, we can understand how specific vulnerabilities arose
and use that knowledge to create Semgrep rules for spotting new
issues. This post provides a practical example of finding a
vulnerability in the Expat C library through variant analysis of an
existing CVE.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KEEP YOUR SOC TEAM ATTACK-READY WITH THE THREAT HUNTING SIMULATOR
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Most SOC teams focus on reactive work but aren't actively looking for
threat actors that have bypassed their security controls. TryHackMe's
THREAT HUNTING SIMULATOR gives analysts a safe, repeatable environment
to practice spotting adversary behaviours [12]. Gamified hunts and
instant feedback enable teams to sharpen detection rules and response
playbooks, without the overhead of building internal labs. Start free
[12] 

 FRACTION LOADER: IN-MEMORY LOADER PROJECT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Fraction Loader is an educational malware project that creates a
stealthy in-memory loader capable of downloading, reassembling, and
executing payload fragments without touching disk. It uses Windows
APIs like VirtualAlloc and WinHTTP to handle encrypted payload chunks,
parse headers for order, and reassemble them into executable memory
with suitable permissions. While meant for penetration testers and
security researchers to learn evasion techniques, it functions as a
weaponized dropper that can bypass file-based detection and pose a
threat to InfoSec professionals monitoring for in-memory attacks. 

 TIDAL CYBER (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Tidal Cyber maps tactics, techniques, procedures, and
procedural-level insights to MITRE ATT&CK to tailor security
strategies around adversary groups and their behavior for threat-led
defenses. 

 FLOW (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Mixeway Flow is a DevSecOps platform that automatically performs four
security scans (SAST, SCA, IaC, and secret detection) on Git
repositories through webhook integration. It aggregates
vulnerabilities from various open-source scanning tools such as
Bearer, OWASP Dependency Track, KICS, and Gitleaks into a single
dashboard for streamlined security management. The platform simplifies
CI/CD pipeline setup and offers thorough application security testing
across code, dependencies, infrastructure, and credential exposure.

was also penalized for showing ads in Gmail based on those cookies.
Meanwhile, SHEIN's opt-out failed as cookies were still sent even when
users clicked “Reject All.”
