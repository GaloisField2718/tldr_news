ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HERTZ SAYS CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL DATA AND DRIVER'S LICENSES STOLEN IN
DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5]

 GOOGLE CHROME FIXES BROWSER HISTORY LEAKS BY PURPLE “VISITED”
LINKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Historically, bad actors have been able to track users' browsing
history by utilizing the ":visited" CSS selector, which turns links
purple. Google is aiming to address this leak by changing the way that
the ":visited" selector is applied to only display if the user has
visited the site from the current top-level site and frame origin.
Effectively, the browser will now display purple links based on the
combination of the current site and visited sites.
