 AN ANALYSIS OF BILLIONS OF CLOUD ASSETS REVEALS INSECURE PRACTICES
ACROSS MOST AI DEPLOYMENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you had a sneaking suspicion that dev teams are rushing ahead with
AI and that it's often at the expense of security‚Ä¶ you were correct.
Orca Security's new research report reveals that:

	* 56% of organizations are using AI to develop their own custom
applications.
	* 62% have deployed an AI package with at least one CVE.
	* 98% of organizations using Google Vertex AI have not enabled
encryption at rest for their self-managed encryption keys.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 T-MOBILE PAYS 31.5M IN FCC SETTLEMENT OVER 4 DATA BREACHES (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The FCC has announced a settlement with T-Mobile over a string of
data breaches that impacted customers from 2021 to 2023. Half of the
settlement will be used for cybersecurity enhancements and the other
half will be paid to the U.S. Treasury as a penalty. T-Mobile has
committed to introducing modern security practices such as zero trust
and MFA as part of the settlement. 

 RACKSPACE INTERNAL MONITORING WEB SERVERS HIT WITH 0-DAY (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Rackspace suffered a breach on its internal monitoring dashboard that
resulted in the company needing to take it offline briefly. Rackspace
has stated that only the monitoring dashboards were affected, not
monitoring and alerting systems generally, and that only a limited
amount of data was accessed. The attackers monitoring information that
was available to the attackers included customer account name and
numbers, customer usernames, internally generated device names IDs,
name and device info, and encrypted internal device credentials.
Rackspace says that the breach was caused by an RCE 0-day in a third
party system. 

 AFP NEWS AGENCY'S CONTENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS HIT BY CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AFP News Agency's content delivery systems were hit by a cyberattack,
disrupting its ability to distribute news to clients. Despite the
attack, AFP's news reporting remains uninterrupted, with technical
teams working to restore full services and secure compromised

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURING YOUR CONTINGENT WORKERS WITH ZERO TRUST (11 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 BPOs are often utilized to provide a large group of contractors for
outsourcing certain tasks like customer service. Onboarding BPOs can
be complicated in a zero-trust environment as zero-trust tools often
rely on managed devices, but providing managed hardware to a BPO can
prove prohibitively expensive. This post provides a number of options
that can be considered. Cloud jump boxes, isolated browsers, managed
devices, and managed VMs all provide methods of accessing resources in
a way that can still tie into an organization's standard zero-trust
procedures. If these solutions are impractical, an organization could
consider using posture-based exclusions or implementing exclusions to
still allow BPOs to access a limited set of data. 

 SIMPLIFYING XSS DETECTION WITH NUCLEI - A NEW APPROACH (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Traditionally, XSS vulnerabilities are difficult to detect with tools
like Nuclei as the tester needs to write a complex set of matchers to
check if the payload is reflected in the response. Nuclei headless
mode allows testers to configure templates to mimic real user actions
on a webpage. When combined with the waitdialog action, a template can
be instructed to wait for a dialog box and a matcher can be configured
to check if the expected message appears in the dialog. This also
enhances accuracy as in the traditional method there's no way to
ensure that the script was triggered. 

 SECURING THE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAIN WITH THE SLSA FRAMEWORK (7 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 This post discusses how the SLSA framework can enhance software
supply chain security by providing a standard for verifying the
creation process of open-source software artifacts. The standard
offers different compliance levels, with Level 3 providing the highest
security through rigorous build platform hardening. Adoption of SLSA
can help prevent attacks on build and distribution processes, but
integrating the framework into package distribution tools is crucial
for maximizing its benefits.

encryption as a further level of security. 

 NEW SECURITY PROTOCOL SHIELDS DATA FROM ATTACKERS DURING CLOUD-BASED
COMPUTATION (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 MIT researchers have developed a security protocol that uses quantum
light to protect data during cloud-based deep-learning computations.
The protocol ensures data security while maintaining 96% accuracy in
deep-learning models. By encoding data into laser light, the protocol
prevents attackers from intercepting information without detection.
