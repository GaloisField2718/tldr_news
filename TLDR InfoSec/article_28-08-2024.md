ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CODE EXECUTION VULNERABILITY FOUND IN WPML PLUGIN INSTALLED ON 1M
WORDPRESS SITES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-6386) in the WPML WordPress plugin
could allow remote code execution on over one million websites. The
flaw stems from improper input sanitization in Twig templates. A
proof-of-concept is available for the vulnerability. Users should
update to WPML version 4.6.13 immediately. 

 MOVEIT HACK EXPOSED PERSONAL DATA OF HALF MILLION TDECU USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Texas Dow Employees Credit Union has reported a data breach stemming
from compromised MOVEit file transfer software that affected over
500,000 members. The breach, which was discovered in July 2024 but
occurred a year earlier, exposed sensitive personal and financial
information. 

 MICROSOFT UPDATE BREAKS DUAL-BOOT (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft's GRUB patch to fix CVE-2022-2601 has led to errors when
trying to boot Linux partitions in dual-boot systems due to
incompatible EFI boot loaders. The workaround for users on affected
distros is to either disable Secure Boot or delete the Microsoft SBAT.
Microsoft maintains that the update should only be installed on
systems without a Linux boot option and has stated that it's working
with Linux partners to address the issue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ADDRESSED AWS DEFAULTS RISKS: OIDC, TERRAFORM, AND ANONYMOUS ACCESS
TO ADMINISTRATORACCESS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post introduces a novel AWS attack in which an attacker can
utilize Terraform Cloud to gain AdministratorAccess on an AWS account
by only knowing (or guessing) the Terraform OIDC role and AWS account
ID of a victim. This attack is possible when an OIDC's role is created
with a trust relationship that does not specify a subject key, which
previously was the default when creating a Federated Identity using
the GUI. AWS has addressed this vulnerability by adding a mandatory
Organization field that becomes the subject field when creating a
Federated Identity using the GUI. This post suggests a Lambda strategy
that defenders can use to periodically scan for this vulnerability. 

 CLOUD DFIR - AWS IAM PRIVESC LEADS TO EC2 RANSOMWARE (13 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This post examines the AWS DFIR process in a fictional scenario where
an organization suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted all files
on all of its EC2 instances. The analyst first investigated Sysmon
logs on a Windows EC2 instance and identified that the AWS SSM Run
Command was used to download malicious scripts from a GitHub repo
which were then executed as SYSTEM. They then analyzed CloudTrail logs
to identify the role that was used to run the SSM commands, but since
it was a commonly used role to execute SSM Commands, the analyst also
needed to track down the user that assumed the role in the given
timeframe. Upon identifying the compromised user, the analyst also
identified that the attacker moved laterally from the initially
compromised account by creating access keys for the account that had
permissions to assume the SSM commands role. 

 MACOS X MALWARE DEVELOPMENT (36 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The blog post, in which the author discusses designing malware for
macOS, covering its architecture, security features, Mach API, kernel
internals, and shellcode injection, was originally written in 2022 and
updated for macOS X Catalina. It emphasizes the importance of
understanding system calls, memory protection mechanisms, and code
injection techniques using Mach APIs on macOS. The author recommends
further reading on the topic and highlights the importance of
understanding the environment, features, and security of macOS through
practical examples.

 HOW SOME LET'S ENCRYPT RENEWAL FAILURES POINTED TO AN AWS TRAFFIC
HIJACKING ISSUE (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 An AWS customer began to notice connectivity issues with Let's
Encrypt renewals in a VPS that they used that they were not able to
resolve with support from the VPS provider. After debugging with AWS,
they discovered that the traffic was being routed to a third party
that was advertising a typoed BGP route through Direct Connect that
unintentionally overlapped with the original AWS customer's IP range.
AWS support confirmed that its BGP route verification process failed
in this circumstance and has added process improvements to prevent
possible malicious traffic hijacking through this vector in the
future.
