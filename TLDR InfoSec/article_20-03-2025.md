 AWS CLOUD VISIBILITY BEST PRACTICES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You can't secure what you can't see.

Without full visibility into your AWS environment, it's easy to get
buried in alerts without knowing which ones actually matter.

Learn how to strengthen your AWS security [4] with clear visibility
and smarter risk prioritization:

 	* Cut through alert noise and focus on real threats 
 	* Use agentless scanning and centralized logging for better
insights

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CALIFORNIA CRYOBANK CONFIRMA DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 California Cryobank, one of the largest reproductive tissue banks in
the world, has disclosed a data breach that affects an undisclosed
number of Americans. The hackers potentially stole data that includes
SSNs, driver's license numbers, financial account numbers, and health
insurance information. No known threat actor has claimed
responsibility for the attack. 

 CRITICAL AMI MEGARAC BUG CAN LET ATTACKERS HIJACK AND BRICK SERVERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MegaRAC BMC software enables remote server management, allowing
admins to troubleshoot as if present. Eclypsium researchers identified
a CVSS 10 vulnerability permitting remote, unauthenticated attackers
to control affected servers. AMI, the software's developer, has issued
patches to OEM manufacturers for customer rollout. 

 USE ONE VIRTUAL MACHINE TO OWN THEM ALL — ACTIVE EXPLOITATION OF
VMWARE ESX HYPERVISOR ESCAPE ESXICAPE (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 VMware has released patches for three zero-day vulnerabilities in
ESXi, which allowed threat actors to escape the hypervisor and access
critical server data. The vulnerabilities are actively being exploited
in the wild, posing a significant risk to organizations using VMware
environments. It is crucial to patch affected systems promptly to
prevent potential security breaches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW VULNERABILITY IN GITHUB COPILOT AND CURSOR: HOW HACKERS CAN
WEAPONIZE CODE AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Pillar Security have discovered a new prompt
injection technique on Cursor and GitHub Copilot. These systems use
rules files to guide the prompting for the LLM, which is often
distributed by open-source projects or from other untrusted locations.
This attack involves utilizing invisible Unicode characters to hide
malicious instructions for the LLM that can be used to instruct it to
poison the generated code. 

 TURNING THE SECURITY FLYWHEEL (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post outlines seven security flywheels: reducing costs to raise
security baselines, transitioning threat intelligence from push to
pull, creating digital twins through asset inventory, enhancing
detection via red teaming, identifying adjacent business benefits of
security measures, implementing continuous control monitoring and
forming federated teams that seek assistance instead of pushing
initiatives. Each flywheel creates a cycle where initial investments
yield benefits that can be reinvested, ultimately easing the burden on
security teams while sustaining or improving security posture. 

 BYPASSING WINDOWS DEFENDER APPLICATION CONTROL WITH LOKI C2 (11
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers can bypass Windows Defender Application Control with
LOLBINs and Electron apps using tools like Loki C2. Modifying
JavaScript in trusted Electron apps enables Node.js code injection to
interact with the OS, allowing the execution of malicious payloads and
the creation of advanced C2 agents like Dragon.

 HOW APPSEC TOOLS KILLED APPSEC - AND 3 WAYS TO FIX IT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 40,000+ new CVEs in 2024. Almost 600,000 issues per org. Weeks of
manual triage. Why is AppSec failing, and what can be done
differently? More tools aren't the answer. Read about the three ways
to fix AppSec [11] on the Ox Security blog [11]. 

 AWS IAM POLICY VISUALIZER (WEB APP) [12] 

 AWS IAM Policy Visualizer is a web app that visualizes the relations
in an IAM policy in graph format. The tool also provides a search
function for large policies. 

 CVSS-BT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 cvss-bt enriches the NVD CVSS scores to include Temporal/Threat
Metrics. 

 STRINGREAPER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 StringReaper extracts strings, such as JWT tokens and credentials,
from remote process memory, saving time in engagements. It can filter
memory regions and includes features like listing target sections and
displaying remote environment strings.

 NEW AKIRA RANSOMWARE DECRYPTOR CRACKS ENCRYPTION KEYS USING GPUS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A researcher has released an open-source decryptor for Akira
ransomware that brute forces encryption keys. Akira generates unique
keys for each file using four timestamp seeds, hashes them through
1,500 rounds, and encrypts them with another key, appending them at
the end of each file. The researcher analyzed logs to estimate when
the ransomware was active and used 16 4090s via RunPod & Vast.ai to
decrypt a friend's files in 10 hours. 

 THE GREAT CNAPP RE-BUNDLE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 With Check Point and Palo Alto exiting CNAPP, the field has
consolidated around Wiz and a few leaders, losing much of its previous
hype. CNAPP tools will revert to their components: CSPM for
vulnerability management, ASPM for secure code development, and CADR
for responding to cloud alerts. 

 MALWARE CAMPAIGN 'DOLLYWAY' BREACHED 20,000 WORDPRESS SITES (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A malware campaign called 'DollyWay' has compromised over 20,000
WordPress sites globally, redirecting users to harmful sites since
2016. The campaign has evolved to include advanced evasion techniques
and monetization strategies. GoDaddy researchers have linked this
operation to a larger scam redirection system named 'DollyWay World
Domination.'
