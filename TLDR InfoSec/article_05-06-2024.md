ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 COX FIXED AN API AUTH BYPASS EXPOSING MILLIONS OF MODEMS TO ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Bug bounty hunter Sam Curry discovered an API authentication bypass
in Cox Communications' systems that could give attackers the same
permissions as a tech support agent for the ISP. Attackers could use
the bypass to obtain the PII of customers, reset modems, or gather
WiFi information. Cox took the 700 exposed API endpoints down within
hours of the report and fixed the issue the following day. It has
found no evidence of exploitation.

 PHISHING WITH CLOUDFLARE WORKERS: TRANSPARENT PHISHING AND HTML
SMUGGLING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Netskope Threat Labs is tracking two common phishing techniques that
have been observed in phishing campaigns that utilize Cloudflare
Workers. Attackers are utilizing Cloudflare Workers to deliver an
encoded blob, which is reconstructed on the client to execute HTML
smuggling attacks. Attackers are also utilizing Cloudflare Workers for
transparent phishing attacks, creating MitM channels where attackers
can intercept victims' credentials and MFA while relaying them to a
destination server. 

 SOPHISTICATED RAT TARGETING GULP PROJECTS ON NPM (9 MINUTE READ) [11]


 The Phylum research team identified a new RAT that's masquerading as

malware components once certain conditions are met and the second acts
as the RAT. This blog explains the code in the deobfuscated files.
