 IS YOUR TEAM EXPLORING MCP INTEGRATIONS? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly emerging as the go-to
standard for connecting LLMs to external tools and data. But as
adoption picks up, many teams are implementing MCP without a clear
security playbook.

This practical guide [4] breaks down real-world MCP security risks and
offers actionable steps to help teams secure LLM integrations.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RESEARCHERS DETAIL WINDOWS EPM POISONING EXPLOIT CHAIN LEADING TO
DOMAIN PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Security researchers found an exploit chain in Windows Endpoint
Privilege Management (EPM) that lets attackers escalate privileges to
domain admin. The attack poisons EPM policies to bypass security
controls and elevate privileges. Organizations using Windows EPM
should review their settings and update security measures. 

 BOUYGUES TELECOM HIT BY CYBERATTACK, 6.4 MILLION CUSTOMERS AFFECTED
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Bouygues Telecom, a French provider, suffered a cyberattack that
exposed the data of 6.4 million customers, including names, emails,
and phone numbers, but not payment info. It notified affected
customers and authorities during its investigation. 

 CONNEX CREDIT UNION DATA BREACH IMPACTS 172,000 PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Hackers breached Connex Credit Union systems June 2–3, likely
stealing files with names, account numbers, debit card data, Social
Security numbers, and government IDs. Connex reported 172,000
impacted, but there was no evidence of access to accounts or funds.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE SECURITY PRINCIPLES GUIDING 1PASSWORD'S APPROACH TO AI (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Seven core security principles for AI integration: encrypting
secrets, using deterministic authorization over probabilistic LLM
decisions, preventing raw credentials in LLM contexts, maintaining
auditability, ensuring transparency, implementing least privilege, and
balancing security with usability. AI agents must follow strict access
controls, similar to humans, with credentials delivered securely
(e.g., OAuth) rather than through LLM prompts, maintaining a
zero-knowledge architecture. These principles show that traditional
siloed privileged access management is inadequate for the AI era,
which will require unified frameworks for both human and AI
interactions. 

 THREE DOTS TO ROOT: HOW I FOUND A PATH TRAVERSAL IN MICROSOFT'S
AGENTIC WEB (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft's NLWeb is a new framework designed to allow AI agents to
interact with websites and APIs via natural language. This author
describes how they discovered a path traversal vulnerability that
could lead to the disclosure of arbitrary files such as `/etc/passwd`
or `.env`. The vulnerability was caused by the use of the
`os.path.normpath()` function, which does not prevent “climbing
out” of the directory using `../`. 

 CONSTRUCTING A TRUSTWORTHY EVALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR CONTEXTUAL
SECURITY ANALYSIS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DryRun Security uses an AI engine called Contextual Security Analysis
(CSA) to analyze code changes probabilistically. Each PR goes through
three steps: whole-PR synthesis to understand the goal, hunk-scoped
reasoning to isolate individual code hunks and filter out unrelated
changes, and on-demand context acquisition to retrieve supporting
files and dependencies. DryRun also has a secondary audit model that
randomly samples production findings every 24 hours to check
instruction compliance, hallucination detection, and vulnerability
accuracy.

 IDA PRO CROSS-REFERENCE GENERATOR FOR MANDIANT XREFER (GITHUB REPO)
[12] 

 Professional IDAPython script that generates additional
cross-references for IDA Pro that aren't automatically detected,
specifically designed for use with the Mandiant XRefer plugin. 

 EPSS PULSE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 RunZero's EPSS Pulse is a free tool that tracks trends in Exploit
Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) data to help security teams
prioritize vulnerability remediation. It shows which vulnerabilities
are gaining or losing exploitation likelihood over time, helping
defenders focus on critical patches. Monitoring EPSS score changes
enables organizations to make better vulnerability management
decisions beyond static CVSS scores. 

 TONIC SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Tonic Security provides an AI agent–driven exposure management
platform that ingests org data and threat intel to contextualize risk,
prioritize remediation, reduce alert noise, and accelerate fixes. The
company claims 50% faster MTTR and 90% fewer remediation actions
needed.

 UTILITIES, FACTORIES AT RISK FROM ENCRYPTION HOLES IN INDUSTRIAL
PROTOCOL (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OPC UA, a widely used industrial protocol, contains cryptographic
design flaws that enable authentication bypass and message confusion
attacks. Researcher Tom Tervoort has disclosed CVEs and PoCs that
affect multiple vendors. He recommends applying patches, disabling OPC
UA over HTTPS and Basic128Rsa15, and enforcing network restrictions
like IP allowlists to limit exposure. 

 APPSEC/PRODSEC'S REALITY GAP (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Application and Product Security face a disparity in connecting
theoretical security concepts to practical environments. A lack of
context defines the problem space, teams trying to avoid slowing down
development, security tools not addressing where teams are struggling
or organizational scale, and tooling being designed for gates instead
of guardrails. AI-based tools may help in providing more context and
tailored experiences, but they will not alleviate the resource
constraints that many teams face. 

 SECURITY FLAWS IN A CARMAKER'S WEB PORTAL LET ONE HACKER REMOTELY
UNLOCK CARS FROM ANYWHERE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Security researcher Eaton Zveare found a vulnerability in a
carmaker's web portal that let him create an admin account with full
access. He could access customers' personal and financial data, track
vehicles, and enroll customers in features to control some car
functions remotely. During testing, Zveare remotely unlocked and took
control of a friend's vehicle.
