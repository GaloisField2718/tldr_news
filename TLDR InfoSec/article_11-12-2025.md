 VALIDATE AND SCOPE ALERTS FASTER WITH NETSCOUT'S PACKET-LEVEL
VISIBILITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 SOC efficiency is the most valuable currency in cybersecurity [5] -
but ESG research has found that 55% of security teams take hours just
to confirm if an alert is real [6]. This gives attackers plenty of
time to move laterally through your network.

NETSCOUT Omnis Cyber Intelligence [4] delivers packet-level
visibility that eliminates the guesswork. With real-time metadata from
deep packet inspection, your analysts have the full context they need
to investigate incidents.

NETSCOUT delivers:

 	* Faster investigation and response
 	* Visibility across hybrid and multicloud environments without blind
spots
 	* Unified data that bridges SecOps and NetOps teams

Stay ahead of risk with NETSCOUT [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NET SOAPWN FLAW OPENS DOOR FOR FILE WRITES AND REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
VIA ROGUE WSDL (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A .NET Framework design flaw, dubbed SOAPwn, allows attackers to
weaponize WSDL-based SOAP client proxies to write arbitrary files or
redirect SOAP requests to attacker-controlled locations. This can
enable NTLM credential capture and remote code execution via web
shells or malicious scripts. Impacted enterprise products include
Barracuda Service Center RMM and Ivanti EPM, which have begun shipping
security fixes. 

 CYDOME FLAGS MIRAI VARIANT BROADSIDE, TARGETS MARITIME LOGISTICS
THROUGH TBK DVR DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A Mirai variant named Broadside is actively compromising maritime
logistics systems by exploiting a vulnerability in TBK digital video
recorder (DVR) devices. Broadside uses a custom C2 protocol, a unique
“Magic Header,” and aggressively kills competing malware. Beyond
DDoS capabilities, it can harvest system credentials, posing an
elevated risk to operational technology environments. 

 GOOGLE ADS FOR SHARED CHATGPT AND GROK GUIDES PUSH MACOS INFOSTEALER
MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A phishing campaign uncovered by Kaspersky and Huntress is abusing
Google ads to lure macOS users searching for troubleshooting tips. The
ads lead to public ChatGPT and Grok “shared conversations” posing
as legitimate guides, but instead push victims to download the AMOS
infostealer.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DECLARATIVE BINARY PARSING FOR SECURITY RESEARCH WITH KAITAI STRUCT
(15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Kaitai Struct enables describing binary file formats in a declarative
YAML-based language and automatically generating parsers in many
languages, which is very useful for reverse engineering, malware
analysis, and protocol or firmware research. This example walks
through designing a dummy KAISTDE binary format, manually serializing
and parsing it in C and Python, then expressing the same structure in
a .ksy spec so the Kaitai compiler can emit a robust parser and
visualizations. 

 AWS LAMBDA MANAGED INSTANCES: A SECURITY OVERVIEW (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 During re:Invent 2025, AWS announced Lambda Managed Instances, which
enable Lambda functions to run on AWS-managed EC2 instances. AWS
prevents users from attaching instance roles to these instances,
unlike other managed instances. EKS-managed nodes do not allow direct
instance access via tools like SSM or EC2 Instance Connect. The
instances run AWS' container-optimized Linux distribution,
Bottlerocket OS, and execute Lambda functions as containerd
containers. 

 NEW RANSOMWARE 01FLIP: MULTI-PLATFORM RANSOMWARE WRITTEN IN RUST (22
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 01flip is a new Rust-based ransomware family (tracked as CL-CRI-1036)
that targets critical infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region,
leveraging Rust's cross-compilation capabilities to support both
Windows and Linux platforms. Attackers exploited CVE-2019-11580 for
initial access, deployed Sliver C2 framework for lateral movement, and
used AES-128-CBC with RSA-2048 encryption while demanding one bitcoin
ransom, with subsequent data leaks appearing on dark web forums.
Organizations should monitor for Rust-based malware signatures, patch
internet-facing applications against known vulnerabilities, and
implement detection for cross-platform ransomware that uses low-level
API calls and string obfuscation techniques to evade traditional
security controls.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT AI AGENTS WILL LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR. HOW SHOULD YOU
APPROACH SECURITY TODAY? (SPONSOR) [13] 

 “Thought leaders” are confident about non-human identities, but
can they predict what this landscape will look like in 12 months? Not
reliably...

🤨 So how should you defend against a risk that's totally
unpredictable? Start with this RESOURCE FROM OKTA:

 JAPANESE FIRMS SUFFER LONG TAIL OF RANSOMWARE DAMAGE (3 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Ransomware attacks are hitting major Japanese companies and
government bodies, forcing factories, retailers, and service providers
offline for months. Many Japanese organizations depend on older
systems and complex supply chains, so recovery is slow and costly. 

 ONEDRIVE. LET'S TAKE THIS OFFLINE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft launched Offline Mode for OneDrive Business customers in
April 2024, which allows users to continue using the web version of
OneDrive while offline. This works by downloading file metadata and
running a SharePoint web server locally. This post introduces an
update to the OneDriveExplorer, which can parse the cache used for
offline mode. 

 CAN LLMS DETECT IDORS? UNDERSTANDING THE BOUNDARIES OF AI REASONING
(10 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Semgrep tested Claude Code with Sonnet 4 and OpenAI Codex with GPT5's
ability to detect IDOR vulnerabilities in code with four levels of
increasing difficulty, from no authorization to implicit authorization
through middleware. In total, the models identified 15 real,
previously unknown vulnerabilities and 93 false positives, with Sonnet
4 performing best. In its test with a generic prompt, Semgrep found
that the models could detect some simpler IDOR vulnerabilities but
failed in more complex cases.

 HTTPS CERTIFICATE INDUSTRY PHASING OUT LESS SECURE DOMAIN VALIDATION
METHODS (4 MINUTE READ) [24]

SC-090, and SC-091 to sunset 11 legacy Domain Control Validation
methods relying on email, phone, fax, postal mail, and reverse DNS
lookups by March 2028, pushing Certificate Authorities toward
automated, cryptographically verifiable ACME-based validation to
prevent fraudulent certificate issuance.
