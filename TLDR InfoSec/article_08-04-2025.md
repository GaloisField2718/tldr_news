ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TEXAS STATE BAR WARNS OF DATA BREACH AFTER INC RANSOMWARE CLAIMS
ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The State Bar of Texas suffered a data breach perpetrated by the INC
ransomware gang. The threat actors stole full names, case documents,
and other redacted information. The State Bar of Texas is offering
free credit monitoring to victims and recommends that victims consider
placing credit freezes. 

 EUROPCAR GITLAB BREACH EXPOSES DATA OF UP TO 200K CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A hacker breached the GitLab repos of the Europcar car rental company
and stole source code for the mobile apps and personal information
belonging to up to 200K customers. The threat actor discovered 9,000
SQL files, which include customers' names and email addresses, and 269
.env files. Europcar has confirmed the breach but has not provided
more information. 

 OUTLAW LINUX MALWARE: PERSISTENT, UNSOPHISTICATED, AND SURPRISINGLY
EFFECTIVE (33 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Outlaw infects systems through SSH brute-force attacks, establishes
persistence via cron jobs and SSH key manipulation, and deploys a
three-part payload consisting of XMRIG for cryptocurrency mining,
STEALTH SHELLBOT for remote control, and BLITZ for further
propagation. Despite its unsophisticated nature, Outlaw remains
effective because it leverages stolen system resources for mining
profit while simultaneously expanding its botnet through continuous
SSH brute-forcing of nearby systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THIS SNEAKY ANDROID SPYWARE NEEDS A PASSWORD TO UNINSTALL. HERE'S HOW
TO REMOVE IT WITHOUT ONE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Techcrunch has identified a new stalkerware app that requires a
password to uninstall it. The app works by requiring the person who
installs it to enable a built-in Android feature that allows for
overlaying content, which allows the app to display the password
prompt, which requires a password set by the person who installs it to
dismiss whenever the user tries to uninstall it. Users can uninstall
the app without a password by booting into safe mode. The app
masquerades in the installed app list as a default Android app and
also installs a device admin profile. 

 WINDOWS REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL: REMOTE TO ROGUE (18 MINUTE READ) [9]


 In October 2024, Google Threat Intelligence Group discovered a
Russian-linked phishing campaign targeting European government and
military organizations. The attackers used signed RDP file attachments
to create remote connections to their servers, allowing file theft and
clipboard data capture. They exploited lesser-known RDP features like
resource redirection and RemoteApps, potentially using tools like
PyRDP to automate their activities. This campaign shows how attackers
can combine existing techniques creatively while leaving minimal
forensic traces by focusing on file theft, clipboard data capture, and
accessing environment variables for espionage. 

 HUNTING PANDAS (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The post dives into Mustang Panda, which is targeting various
organizations worldwide. By analyzing indicators of compromise,
potential overlaps between Red Delta, APT41, and Mustang Panda were
identified. The investigation led to uncovering additional
infrastructure and operational connections between the threat actors.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KNOWING WHAT TO SECURE IS MORE THAN HALF THE BATTLE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 When you don't know what actually exists in your environment, you
could easily be leaving critical gaps that leave you vulnerable.
That's why better security starts with aggregating your asset
inventory [11], so you can maximize the security tools you already
have. Read more on the Prelude blog [12] 

 MORF (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MORF is an advanced mobile security analysis tool that automatically
discovers sensitive information within Android and iOS applications. 

 RAMIGPT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 RamiGPT is an AI-powered offensive security agent designed to
autonomously escalate privileges using OpenAI. 

 WIZ VULNERABILITY DATABASE (WEBSITE) [15] 

 Wiz has launched a new site designed for security teams and cloud
professionals to monitor significant vulnerabilities in cloud
environments. It offers technology-based filtering options, features
CISA KEV exploits, and includes high-profile CVEs with known exploits
from the past 60 days.

MISCELLANEOUS

 WHAT IS CODE TO CLOUD AND DOES IT MATTER? (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Code to cloud promises to reduce the cognitive load of vulnerability
management by providing the exact lines of code that need to change to
remediate a finding. It can also aid security teams by helping them
find the right person for a fix, understand how widespread a problem
is, and aid in prioritization. Code to cloud can be achieved via
customers manually linking source repos to container images, container
tagging, or the provider ingesting all the data a customer provides
and using data modeling to identify relationships. 

 SPYCLOUD RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ENDPOINT DETECTION AND ANTIVIRUS
SOLUTIONS MISS TWO-THIRDS (66%) OF MALWARE INFECTIONS (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 SpyCloud's research shows that 66% of malware infections happen on
devices with endpoint security. Although EDR tools have advanced,
modern malware evades detection. SpyCloud integrates with EDR products
to close the detection gap and defend against cyber threats. 

 XANTHOROX AI SURFACES ON DARK WEB AS FULL SPECTRUM HACKING ASSISTANT
(3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Xanthorox AI is a new hacking tool circulating on the dark web that
offers advanced capabilities for cyber operations. It uses
custom-built language models and various modules for automated
attacks. Experts recommend using AI-powered security solutions to
detect and prevent such threats effectively.
