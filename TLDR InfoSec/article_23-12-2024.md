 ASCENSION: HEALTH DATA OF 5.6 MILLION STOLEN IN RANSOMWARE ATTACK (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ascension, a large U.S. healthcare system, had the personal and
health data of 5.6 million patients and employees stolen in a
ransomware attack. The breach led to the company offering free
identity theft protection services to those affected for 24 months.
The ransomware attack impacted electronic health records and forced
the healthcare giant to temporarily halt some services. 

 OVER 25K SONICWALL VPN FIREWALLS EXPOSED TO CRITICAL FLAWS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Bishop Fox identified over 400K SonicWall VPN Firewalls with either a
management interface or SSL VPN interface that are internet exposed.
Of these devices, over 20K are running end-of-life firmware versions.
However, a larger total of over 25K firewalls that are exposed are
vulnerable to a critical vulnerability, and nearly 100K are exposed to
a high vulnerability.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RTOS: EVERYTHING IS REAL TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) are specialized systems that
handle time-critical tasks with strict deadlines. Unlike general
operating systems, RTOS prioritizes predictable execution timing and
is essential in applications from car brakes to video games where
split-second precision is crucial. This blog post dives into
everything RTOS and their uses for cybersecurity. 

 FROM GUARDIAN TO GATEWAY: THE HIDDEN RISK OF EDR VULNERABILITIES (11
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author decided to examine the Wazuh EDR tool via fuzzing and
found 2 vulnerabilities that could lead to total network compromise.
Wazuh consists of an agent that runs on the device, a server that
accepts events from the agent, and an analysis engine that parses the
event to trigger actions. The author describes how they discovered a
command injection vulnerability in the host_deny active response which
they chained with a heap buffer overflow that allowed for RCE to
achieve unauthenticated RCE as root to compromise a full network. 

 WINNTI HACKERS TARGET OTHER THREAT ACTORS WITH NEW GLUTTON MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Winnti hacking group has begun using a new Glutton backdoor to
attack targets in the US and China. Glutton is a PHP malware that
masquerades as a php-fpm process that facilitates fileless execution
and injects malicious code into PHP files. It is an advanced backdoor
that establishes persistence and supports 22 commands for C2. Notably,
the Winnti group has been hiding Glutton in tools sold on cybercrime
forums to attack other cybercrime groups and steal their information.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KRUEGER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Krueger, a .NET post-exploitation tool, can remotely disable Endpoint
Detection and Response (EDR) during lateral movement procedures. It
utilizes Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC), a Microsoft
application control utility capable of blocking code at both user and
kernel-mode levels. With administrative privileges on a remote target,
Krueger can deploy a WDAC policy and remotely reboot the device,
preventing the EDR service from starting. 

 ANNOUNCING OPA 1.0: A NEW STANDARD FOR POLICY AS CODE (3 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 OPA 1.0 is a major release that enhances Policy as Code development,
focusing on improving the developer experience and consistency of the
language. Users are encouraged to upgrade to OPA 1.0 for new features,
syntax improvements, and performance enhancements, with detailed
instructions provided for a smooth transition. The release signifies a
significant milestone for the project, offering a solid foundation for
Policy as Code projects and inviting community feedback to shape
future releases. 

 FLARE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Flare watches for signs on the dark web that its customers' logins
are being circulated and then automatically resets the impacted
passwords before the thieves can gain access. It also watches for
stolen session cookies that can trick computers into thinking the
hacker is a previously authenticated user.

 WHAT DO ATTACKERS KNOW ABOUT YOUR AWS ACCOUNT? (8 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Much of the common wisdom around Cloud Security as well as CNAPP
tooling does not consider the discoverability aspect of exploiting
resources. This post enumerates some prior work on AWS reconnaissance
techniques such as exploiting CDK naming, brute forcing SQS queues,
abusing misconfigured ECR policies, and domain takeover via deleted S3
buckets. The author then introduces a new tool that they created
called awseye that can enumerate discoverable resources given an AWS
account ID. 

 INTRODUCING AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE AWS SECRETS MANAGER TRANSFORM
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AWS Secrets Manager offers transforms that will add a nested
CloudFormation stack for HostedLambdaRotation that allows for
pre-built Lambdas for secrets rotations for a subset of supported
secrets. AWS has now enhanced this offering to support automatic
upgrades of the Lambda functions as well as more CloudFormation
resource attributes. The blog post contains upgrade instructions but
also notes that the new transforms are not backwards compatible. 

 THE WINDOWS REGISTRY ADVENTURE #5: THE REGF FILE FORMAT (89 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This detailed blog post from Google Project Zero explores the regf
file format used by the Windows Registry since Windows NT 3.1, which
uniquely represents registry data simultaneously on disk and in
memory. The format consists of several key components including a base
block (header), bins that store data in 4KB chunks, and cells that
contain the actual registry data like keys, values, and security
descriptors. The post also explains how Windows implements
self-healing properties when loading potentially corrupted hives,
attempting to fix or isolate damaged data while preserving overall
hive integrity whenever possible.
