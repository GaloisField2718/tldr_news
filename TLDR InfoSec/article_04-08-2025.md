TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-08-04

 800% SPIKE IN STOLEN CREDENTIALS DETECTED IN FLASHPOINT'S GLOBAL
THREAT INTELLIGENCE INDEX (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Drawing from +3.6 petabytes of data [4], Flashpoint's 2025 Midyear
Threat Index reveals a sharp acceleration in malicious activity and
spotlights critical threats defenders must prioritize.

This intelligence briefing goes beyond public sources like NVD (which
has a 42,000 vulnerability backlog) to deliver proprietary insights
from illicit marketplaces, ransomware blogs, and stealer logs [4] that
security teams can't get anywhere else.

The report highlights cascading threats (infostealers => billions of
exposed credentials), why "identity" has become the dominant attack
vector, and which emerging ransomware groups are filling LockBit's
void.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CL-STA-0969 INSTALLS COVERT MALWARE IN TELECOM NETWORKS DURING
10-MONTH ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Chinese state-sponsored threat actor CL-STA-0969 conducted a 10-month
espionage campaign that targeted Southeast Asian telecom networks. The
campaign used custom malware, including AuthDoor, GTPDOOR, and
ChronosRAT, to enable remote control and location tracking. The group
deployed advanced evasion techniques, including DNS tunneling and
traffic routing through compromised mobile operators, while
maintaining high operational security. There was no evidence of data
exfiltration despite the attackers installing multiple backdoors and
scanning tools across critical telecommunications infrastructure. 

 CRITICAL ALERT: AKIRA RANSOMWARE SURGE TARGETS SONICWALL FIREWALLS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Akira ransomware attacks targeting SonicWall SSL VPN connections have
surged since July. Exploiting CVE-2024-40766 (CVSS 9.3) and unpatched
SonicOS devices with disabled MFA, attackers rapidly escalate from VPN
access to system encryption within hours, affecting hundreds of
thousands of devices across multiple SonicWall generations.
Organizations must immediately patch to the latest firmware, enable
MFA on all VPN accounts, and restrict firewall management access to
trusted IP ranges. 

 ATTACKERS EXPLOIT LINK-WRAPPING SERVICES TO STEAL MICROSOFT 365
LOGINS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cloudflare's Email Security team observed a new campaign in which
threat actors abuse link-wrapping services from Proofpoint and
Intermedia to phish users for Microsoft 365 credentials. Attackers
abused Proofpoint link-wrapping in various ways, including
multi-tiered redirect abuse with URL shorteners via compromised
accounts. In the Intermedia campaign, threat actors sent a message
impersonating a “Zix” secure message notification or a Teams
notification that would redirect users to a fake login page to harvest
Teams credentials.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPLOITING TRUST: HOW SIGNED KERNEL DRIVERS FUEL MODERN KERNEL LEVEL
ATTACKS ON WINDOWS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An emerging pattern in kernel level attacks is to use a signed kernel
loader to load a signed second stage kernel driver or reflectively
load an unsigned kernel driver. These signed drivers are often signed
via the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP). The WHCP
requires an extended validation (EV) certificate, which is designed to
increase the security of the program. However, the EV certificate
application process requires little human interaction, and there are
dark web sellers of EV code-signing certificates. 

 KUBERNETES SECURITY FUNDAMENTALS: AUTHORIZATION (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Kubernetes handles authorization by utilizing multiple authorization
providers in the cluster requested in the order specified to the
kube-server as flags on startup. Each provider can explicitly approve
or deny the request or respond with “no opinion.” If all providers
respond “no opinion,” the request is denied. Providers include
AlwaysAllow and AlwaysDeny, which allow or deny every request; Node
Authorizer, which restricts the access of the kubelet user;
Attribute-Based Access Controls (ABAC), which enables cluster-admins
to define authorization rules based on the request's characteristics
statically; Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC), which is the most
commonly used provider and maps permissions to roles; and Webhook,
which is widely used in cloud provider clusters like AKS, GKE, and
EKS. 

 SILENT PUSH CEO ON CYBERCRIME TAKEDOWNS: 'IT'S AN ONGOING
CAT-AND-MOUSE GAME' (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In this interview, Silent Push CEO Ken Bagnall discusses tracking
Funnull, a Philippines-based company providing infrastructure for
financial scams that cost US victims $200 million. The firm maps
criminal networks for law enforcement but faces challenges when groups
adapt to surveillance. Bagnall compares state-tolerated cybercrime to
historical privateering, requiring national-level responses.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 COMPOSE YOUR WAY WITH PROVIDER SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Docker Compose has announced the release of Provider services, which
enables users to extend the capabilities of Docker Compose files by
calling provider plugins that can interact with external services.
This post includes an example of how to use the Telepresence traffic
manager for a Kubernetes cluster. 

 ECHO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Echo offers CVE-free container base images in a similar space to
Chainguard or recently Wiz. Customers simply need to replace their
Dockerfile base image with Echo's secure version without any other
changes. 

 PLAYBOOK-NG (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Playbook-NG is a stateless web-based application that matches
incident findings with countermeasures for adversary containment and
eviction. Users can export the results in numerous formats such as
JSON, Microsoft Word, Excel, and Markdown. The application does not
save information about the users or their inputs. Work is cleared when
the user browses off or clears the playbook.

 ANTHROPIC SAYS OPENAI ENGINEERS USING CLAUDE CODE AHEAD OF GPT-5
LAUNCH (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Anthropic revoked OpenAI's access to the Claude API after discovering
ChatGPT engineers were using Claude Code tools ahead of GPT-5's
expected launch next week. The incident highlights competitive
tensions in AI development, with Anthropic's spokesperson noting that
Claude Code has become the “go-to choice for coders everywhere,”
including OpenAI's technical staff. Whether OpenAI used Claude Code to
enhance GPT-5's coding capabilities remains unclear, but the timing
suggests potential competitive intelligence gathering. 

 SEX TOY MAKER LOVENSE THREATENS LEGAL ACTION AFTER FIXING SECURITY
FLAWS THAT EXPOSED USERS' DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Lovense fixed two security vulnerabilities that exposed user emails
and enabled account takeovers. CEO Dan Liu is considering legal action
over disclosure reports, claiming no data was compromised despite the
security hole. 

 WHEN PUBLIC PROMPTS TURN INTO LOCAL SHELLS: ‘CURXECUTE' – RCE IN
CURSOR VIA MCP AUTO‑START (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Aim Labs has discovered "CurXecute," a high-severity vulnerability
(CVE-2025-54135, 8.6 rating) in Cursor IDE that enables remote code
execution through prompt injection. While fixed in version 1.3,
earlier versions remain vulnerable, and attackers can exploit
developer privileges via poisoned MCP data for ransomware, theft, or
AI manipulation.
