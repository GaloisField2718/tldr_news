detection, built-in network firewall and WAF, integrated CDR, DLP, and
ATP, and more.

‚û°Ô∏è Exceptional visibility and governance [4] via full integration
of NIST CSF for digital rights management.

‚û°Ô∏è Deploy on-premises, private cloud, hybrid cloud, hosted, or

 THE SELF-DRIVING IDE IS COMING (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A blog post that describes the difficulty in creating IDE plugins and
how Sourcegraph aims to solve this by implementing plugins for its AI
assistant, Cody. There are over a dozen popular IDEs that each utilize
different APIs, leading to plugin developers needing to reimplement
each feature for every IDE, an insurmountable barrier. Sourcegraph is
attempting to solve this problem with Cody by utilizing a separate
Cody binary to orchestrate interactions with each IDE's API instead of
fully implementing each feature for each IDE.
