 STOP REPLACING IDPS THAT ALREADY WORK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You don't need to migrate off Google Workspace to get stronger access
control. If your IdP already handles authentication, the real gaps are
after login—who (or what) can access what, when, and why. Switching
IdPs often adds cost and friction but does little to fix privilege
sprawl. Opal [5] sits on top of your existing stack, automating
just-in-time access, audit trails, and review workflows [6] so you can
enforce least privilege without touching authentication or disrupting
users. It's how teams like CLOUDFLARE, DATABRICKS, FIGMA, PERPLEXITY,
and RUNWAY strengthen identity security with the IdPs they already
use.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DATA BREACH AT DOCTORS IMAGING GROUP IMPACTS 171,000 PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Doctors Imaging Group, a Florida-based radiology provider, reported a
breach where hackers accessed their network for several days in
November 2024. Over 171,000 people had personal and medical data
compromised, including Social Security and account numbers. 

 REDIS WARNS OF CRITICAL FLAW IMPACTING THOUSANDS OF INSTANCES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Redis security team has released patches for a new critical (CVSS
10/10) vulnerability that could allow attackers to gain remote code
execution. The vulnerability is caused by a 13-year-old use-after-free
vulnerability that can be exploited by authenticated threat actors
using a specially crafted Lua script. Redis recommends that
administrators patch their servers and, to secure their instances
further, they can enable authentication, disable Lua scripting and
other unnecessary commands, launch Redis as a non-root user, and
enable Redis logging. 

 THE SALESLOFT-DRIFT BREACH: ANALYZING THE BIGGEST SAAS BREACH OF 2025
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The biggest SaaS security incident in 2025 exploited the integration
between Salesloft and Drift, compromising over 700 companies.
Attackers abused OAuth tokens and SaaS-to-SaaS connections to move
laterally, bypassing traditional security defenses and harvesting
sensitive credentials. The supply chain nature of the breach allowed a
single compromise to spread rapidly across interconnected apps like
Salesforce and Gmail, amplifying its impact.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FANTASTIC AWS POLICIES AND WHERE TO FIND THEM (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS presents a large surface of IAM policies that are available
across principal policies, resource policies, AWS Resource Access
Manager, resource control policies, and IAM Identity Center permission
sets. This post provides a listing and explanation of many of these
policies, as well as introducing a new tool called iam-collect.
iam-collect can download all IAM policies across every account in an
organization for analysis and also provides a set of agent
instructions that can be used with an LLM to explore the data further.


 FLIPSWITCH: A NOVEL SYSCALL HOOKING TECHNIQUE (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 FlipSwitch is a novel Linux rootkit technique that bypasses kernel
6.9's new syscall dispatch mechanism by directly patching machine code
in the x64_sys_call function rather than overwriting the traditional
sys_call_table. The technique locates specific call instructions
within the kernel dispatcher and modifies their 4-byte offsets to
redirect syscalls to malicious functions, demonstrating how attackers
adapt to kernel hardening measures. This research highlights the
ongoing arms race between Linux kernel security improvements and
rootkit evolution. Elastic has provided YARA signatures to detect this
proof-of-concept implementation. 

 AN IN-DEPTH RESEARCH-BASED WALK-THROUGH OF AN UNINITIALIZED LOCAL
VARIABLE STATIC ANALYZER (19 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cybervelia researchers developed a Binary Ninja engine-based static
analyzer that detects uninitialized local variables (ULVs) in stripped
binaries by reconstructing stack layouts, tracking read-before-write
patterns through Medium-Level IL analysis, and implementing
interprocedural taint propagation to trace data flows across function
calls. The tool addresses the challenge that modern compiler
optimizations obscure ULVs in binaries, despite improved source-level
detection, by utilizing techniques such as neighbor-offset heuristics
for size inference and proximity-based coverage analysis to identify
genuine vulnerabilities. The analyzer integrates IDA Pro symbol
importing and Intel PIN execution tracing to reduce false positives
and focus on actually executed code paths, demonstrating that ULV
detection remains relevant even in modern binaries with recent Linux
kernel vulnerabilities serving as examples.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 👼 A CLOUD FIREWALL YOU DON'T NEED TO BABYSIT (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Firewall rules get incredibly complex and can become a major
distraction (and threat) for leaner teams. Intrusion Shield for AWS
[13] uses decades of trusted threat intelligence to block risky
network traffic automatically. Every malicious connection attempt is
instantly turned into a firewall rule, with no action required from
your team. Goodbye firewall alerts, hello smart prioritization. [13] 

 SETUPHIJACK (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 SetupHijack is a tool that exploits race conditions and insecure file
handling in Windows installer and update processes. 

 FILIGRAN (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Filigran unifies threat intelligence, attack surface, and security
risk analysis, featuring OpenCTI and OpenBAS for intelligence
operations and adversary emulation. 

 INTRODUCING CODEMENDER: AN AI AGENT FOR CODE SECURITY (5 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 CodeMender is a new AI-driven agent developed by Google DeepMind to
discover, patch, and prevent software vulnerabilities automatically.
The tool addresses threats and proactively secures existing code,
enabling developers to build safer software with reduced time spent on
manual vulnerability management.

 KLOPATRA: EXPOSING A NEW ANDROID BANKING TROJAN OPERATION WITH ROOTS
IN TURKEY (15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Klopatra is a sophisticated new Android banking trojan operated by
Turkish-speaking cybercriminals that utilizes commercial-grade Virbox
protection and native code libraries to evade detection. The malware
targets users in Spain and Italy through fake IPTV apps, exploits
Android Accessibility Services for complete device control, and
employs both overlay attacks and Hidden VNC capabilities to conduct
fraudulent operations while victims are asleep. With over 3,000
compromised devices across two main botnets, Klopatra represents a
significant evolution in mobile malware sophistication, demonstrating
how threat actors are adopting professional-grade obfuscation
techniques typically seen in desktop malware. 

 ‘YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO WORK AGAIN': CRIMINALS OFFER REPORTER MONEY
TO HACK BBC (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A BBC reporter was contacted via Signal by a “reach out manager”
from the Medusa ransomware gang, who offered 25% of the ransom if they
gained access to the reporter's corporate device. The reporter played
along to gather more information about the gang's tactics, documenting
increased pressure from the ransomware actor. Eventually, the actor
grew impatient, sending multiple 2FA requests before the reporter
could alert the BBC security team, leading to a disconnection from the
network. 

 APPLE PULLS ICEBLOCK FROM THE APP STORE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The ICEBlock app described itself as “Waze but for ICE sightings”
and allowed users to report sightings of ICE officials anonymously. AG
Pam Bondi stated that Apple removed the app from the App Store after
it was requested to be removed because it presents a threat to law
enforcement officials, which ICEBlock developer Joshua Aaron has
denied, stating it is patently false.
