ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN META MANUS AI AGENT ENABLES ZERO-CLICK
INDIRECT PROMPT INJECTION (25 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SilentBridge is a family of CVSS 9.8 zero-click indirect prompt
injection vulnerabilities in Meta's Manus AI agent that allowed hidden
instructions in web pages, search results, and documents to hijack
high-privilege agent capabilities, including Gmail access, code
execution, and root-level container control. Researchers demonstrated
full exploit chains in which benign actions, such as “summarize this
page,” triggered Gmail data exfiltration, the establishment of a
reverse shell with passwordless sudo escalation, public exposure of
internal code-server tooling, and cross-tenant media access via
unauthenticated CDN paths. Manus deployed mitigations following
responsible disclosure, but the findings highlight a systemic
trust-boundary failure affecting any agentic AI platform that allows
untrusted content to influence privileged tool invocation without
isolation or user consent. 

 CARGURUS DATA BREACH AFFECTS 12.5 MILLION ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Automotive marketplace CarGurus has confirmed a security incident in
which 12.5 million user accounts were exposed, including names, email
addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, financial
prequalification data, and some dealer information. The researchers
attributed the hack to the ShinyHunters group, known for high‑impact
social engineering attacks against major enterprises and universities.


 WYNN RESORTS TAKES ATTACKER'S WORD FOR IT THAT STOLEN STAFF DATA WAS
DELETED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Wynn Resorts confirms ShinyHunters stole extensive employee data,
including personal and HR details, after exploiting Oracle PeopleSoft
and valid credentials since 2025. The company says the crooks claim to
have deleted the data and offers staff credit monitoring. Still,
experts stress ransomware crews rarely erase stolen records and view
such “deletion” promises as indicators of a completed extortion
deal.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW MALICIOUS NPM PACKAGE “AMBAR-SRC” TARGETS DEVELOPERS WITH
OPEN SOURCE MALWARE (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The malicious npm package “ambar-src” accumulated ~50,000
downloads in just three days by typosquatting the popular
“ember-source” package and abusing npm's preinstall script hook to
execute code without any explicit import. The package deployed
OS-specific open-source malware payloads, including encrypted
shellcode on Windows, a Golang-based reverse SSH shell on Linux, and
the Apfell/MythicAgents payload on macOS, all communicating via Yandex
Cloud functions for C2 evasion. Organizations should audit
dependencies for this package, treat any system where it was installed
as fully compromised, and rotate all secrets from a separate machine. 

 LARGE-SCALE ONLINE DEANONYMIZATION WITH LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern LLM agents can deanonymize users at scale by linking
pseudonymous posts to real-world identities across platforms like
Hacker News, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Using proxy tasks such as
cross-platform account matching and splitting single accounts into
multiple identities shows that search-plus-reasoning agents can
re-identify users with high precision, and that performance degrades
slowly even as candidate pools reach tens of thousands, implying
platform-scale feasibility. 

 JA4 FINGERPRINTING AGAINST AI SCRAPERS: A PRACTICAL GUIDE (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 JA4 fingerprinting can be incredibly effective for detecting AI
scrapers, as modifying the fingerprint requires recompiling the full
TLS stack, unlike other methods, such as behavioral detection, that
newer AI agents can mimic. JA4 fingerprints for the ClientHello and
HTTP Headers (JA4H) can be combined with traditional systems to build
a defense-in-depth detection system, which can then forward logs to a
SIEM. This post includes code samples for the detection logic as well
as fingerprints for several common libraries and tools.

 SECURE AWS WORKLOADS WITH ZERO-TRUST AUTOMATION (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Stop managing certificates manually. Palo Alto Networks VM-Series
NGFW [12] automates TLS in Amazon EKS, enforces zero-trust policies
that adapt to AWS tags, and blocks threats in real time with AI/ML.

 ENVEIL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 enveil is a Rust CLI tool that prevents AI coding assistants from
reading plaintext secrets by replacing .env values with encrypted
ev:// references backed by a local AES-256-GCM store. Secrets are
decrypted in memory using an Argon2id-derived key and injected
directly into subprocess environments at launch, ensuring plaintext
values never touch disk. The tool includes import, rotation, and
tamper-detection capabilities, with 31 automated tests that cover all
security invariants. 

 ASTELIA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Astelia is an AI-driven exposure management platform that maps
enterprise environments, models attack paths, and prioritizes
remediation of exploitable vulnerabilities.

 DISCORD CUTS TIES WITH PETER THIEL-BACKED VERIFICATION SOFTWARE AFTER
ITS CODE WAS FOUND TIED TO US SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Discord terminated its partnership with identity verification vendor
Persona after researchers discovered nearly 2,500 accessible files on
a FedRAMP government endpoint, revealing the software performs 269
distinct verification checks, including facial recognition against
watchlists, politically exposed persons screening, and adverse media
categorization across terrorism and espionage categories. Persona's
CEO called the exposure publicly accessible front-end code rather than
a vulnerability, but the discovery follows a 2025 breach at another
Discord verification vendor that exposed government IDs of over 70,000
users. The incident underscores growing supply chain privacy risks in
age verification systems, with Persona still serving OpenAI, Lime, and
Roblox despite the controversy. 

 CLAUDE CODE FLAWS ALLOW REMOTE CODE EXECUTION AND API KEY
EXFILTRATION (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers have uncovered three Claude Code vulnerabilities that
enable remote code execution and silent API key exfiltration when
developers open malicious repositories, abusing hooks, MCP servers,
and environment variables. Exploitation can leak Anthropic API keys,
redirect authenticated traffic, and modify cloud data, shifting the
threat model from just running untrusted code to merely opening
untrusted AI-assisted projects. 

 WHY ‘CALL THIS NUMBER' TOAD EMAILS BEAT GATEWAYS (4 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD) accounted for nearly 28% of
all gateway-bypassing email detections across multiple enterprise
environments between December 2025 and February 2026. These emails
contain only a phone number as the payload, typically impersonating
billing notifications from brands like PayPal or DocuSign, making them
indistinguishable from legitimate business communications that secure
email gateways filter out. The average detected attack combined more
than four evasion techniques simultaneously, with over 1,400 unique
evasion combinations tracked, representing a 130% increase over the
previous study period.

execution via malicious Hooks and MCP configurations in cloned
repositories, plus API key theft through endpoint redirection in
project settings files. 

 DISCORD PUTS GLOBAL AGE VERIFICATION POLICY ON HOLD AFTER BACKLASH (2
MINUTE READ) [22] 

 Discord has delayed its global age verification rollout to the second
half of 2026 and plans to add credit card verification as an
alternative to government IDs or video selfies.
