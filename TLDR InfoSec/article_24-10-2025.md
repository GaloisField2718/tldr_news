 ON THE HUNT FOR A NEW JOB? SCAMMERS HAVE YOU IN THEIR SIGHTS.
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Scammers increase their odds by going after people are at their most
vulnerable. This makes job seekers a perfect target for offers that
are too good to be true. The easiest way to keep yourself safe is by
knowing the signs of a scam and having an email security solution –
like Sublime – that keeps them out of your inbox. You can't be
fooled by a message you never see. Learn about a recent Google Careers
scam [4] with convincing brand imitation and indications of attack
iteration, both signals of cutting edge attacks.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 250 MAGENTO STORES HIT OVERNIGHT AS HACKERS EXPLOIT NEW ADOBE
COMMERCE FLAW (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threat actors are actively exploiting CVE-2025-54236 (SessionReaper,
CVSS 9.1), a critical nested deserialization vulnerability in Adobe
Commerce and Magento that enables remote code execution and customer
account takeover via the Commerce REST API, with over 250 attacks
recorded in 24 hours. Attackers from five known IP addresses are
deploying PHP webshells through ‘/customer/address_file/upload' and
probing phpinfo, while 62% of Magento stores remain unpatched six
weeks after Adobe's fix was released. Security teams must immediately
patch all Adobe Commerce and Magento instances, block the listed
attacker IPs (34.227.25.4, 44.212.43.34, 54.205.171.35,
155.117.84.134, and 159.89.12.166), and monitor for unauthorized file
uploads, as this is the second critical deserialization flaw in these
platforms within two years following CosmicSting (CVE-2024-34102). 

 CRITICAL MCP SERVER FLAW EXPOSES OVER 3K SERVERS AND THOUSANDS OF API
KEYS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Security researchers discovered a critical path traversal
vulnerability in Smithery.ai, a popular MCP server hosting service.
The researchers discovered that they could exploit a path traversal
vulnerability in the dockerBuildPath configuration value to read files
outside of their project. The researchers used this vulnerability to
find a fly.io API token that granted root access to more than 3k
applications. 

 LG UPLUS REPORTS SUSPECTED DATA BREACH, CLAIMS ACTIVE RESPONSE TO
“HACKING” (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 LG Uplus, one of South Korea's major mobile carriers, reported a data
breach. The announcement follows a report from Phrack that a threat
actor infiltrated LG Uplus' internal network and seized data from
nearly 9k servers, including data of 42,256 accounts and 167
employees.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY ORGANIZATIONS ARE ABANDONING STATIC SECRETS FOR MANAGED
IDENTITIES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Organizations are transitioning from static secrets (API keys,
passwords, and tokens) to managed identities, achieving a 95%
reduction in credential management time and a 75% reduction in
learning platform-specific authentication. Major cloud providers (AWS
IAM Roles, Azure Managed Identities, and GCP Service Accounts) now
offer automated, short-lived credential provisioning that eliminates
manual rotation and leakage risks. However, legacy systems and
third-party APIs still require traditional secret management. Security
teams should prioritize discovering existing credentials using NHI
(Non-Human Identity) platforms before migration, aiming to reduce
their secret footprint by 70-80% while maintaining robust secret
management for remaining use cases. 

 MODDING AND DISTRIBUTING MOBILE APPS WITH FRIDA (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Frida enables powerful mobile app modifications by injecting custom
agents into running processes. However, distributing these
modifications for use by others—especially on non-rooted Android
devices—requires embedding Frida's gadget library directly inside
the APK. Using a demo app, this post walks through preparing an agent
script that always rolls a 'one' in a dice app, compiling it, and
patching the APK to include Frida's gadget for autonomous script
execution. 

 COLLECTING IPHONE UNIFIED LOGS VIA MACOS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Unified logs are a forensic resource for iOS that includes granular
background activity that can't be obtained in any other forensic
artifact. The logs can be collected manually on a Mac via
libimobiledevice or automatically using a script written by the
author. The author provides suggestions for commercial and open-source
tools to read the .logarchive, a structured bundle containing binary
.tracev3 files.

 SSH-AUDIT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ssh-audit is an open-source Python tool that audits SSH server and
client configurations by analyzing cryptographic algorithms, key
exchanges, host keys, ciphers, and MACs against security best
practices, with support for policy compliance testing and
vulnerability detection, including Terrapin (CVE-2023-48795) and DHEat
(CVE-2002-20001). The tool provides comprehensive analysis, including
RSA/DH key length testing, algorithm recommendations, multi-threaded
scanning, and built-in hardening guides for OpenSSH, Ubuntu, Debian,
and Rocky Linux platforms. It now flags SHA-1 algorithms as failures,
warns about quantum computing resistance, and includes built-in
policies accessible via -L/--list-policies with custom policy creation
via -M/--make-policy.

 META BOOSTS SCAM PROTECTION ON WHATSAPP AND MESSENGER (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Meta introduced enhanced scam protections for WhatsApp and Messenger,
including screen-sharing warnings during video calls with unknown
contacts and on-device behavioral analysis to flag suspicious
messages, with optional cloud-based AI review that breaks end-to-end
encryption. The company removed over 21,000 fake customer support
Facebook pages targeting users through comment monitoring on
legitimate airline, travel agency, and bank accounts, part of broader
scam trends targeting seniors with fake home remodeling and government
debt relief schemes. Security teams should educate users, especially
vulnerable populations, about enabling these protections, including
Passkeys and Security Checkup features, while noting that cloud-based
AI analysis compromises message encryption. 

 GOOGLE AND CHECK POINT NUKE MASSIVE YOUTUBE MALWARE NETWORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 A coordinated malware campaign on YouTube, known as the Ghost
Network, exploited hijacked accounts to post fake tutorials promising
cracked software and gaming cheats. These videos lured users into
downloading infostealers, which stole credentials and crypto wallets.
The operation relied on fake engagement and resilient tactics, leading
Google and Check Point to remove over 3,000 malicious videos in a
major crackdown. 

 VIBE CODING'S REAL PROBLEM ISN'T BUGS—IT'S JUDGMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 AI code generation enables rapid, large-scale software creation, but
speed and flawed judgment are the real risks. While AI-made code has
vulnerability rates similar to human work, issues like ineffective
coding practices and skipped reviews mean more exposure to breaches,
so experts urge integrating security directly into AI workflows and
cultivating best usage practices.
