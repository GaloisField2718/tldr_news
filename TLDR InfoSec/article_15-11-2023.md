ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 POLONIEX CRYPTO EXCHANGE SUFFERS $100M BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 $100M was transferred from a crypto wallet belonging to the Poloniex
exchange. Blockchain security firm CertiK suggests that the incident
was likely the result of a compromised private key. Poloniex is
committed to reimbursing customers and has offered a 5% bug bounty to
the hacker upon return of the funds. 

 CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS PROTECTING SSH CONNECTIONS STOLEN IN NEW ATTACK (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The private key material of cryptographic keys can be leaked due to
naturally occurring errors in SSH connections. Researchers were able
to reconstruct private key material using lattice-based cryptography
by comparing faulty signatures generated as part of the connection
setup with successful signatures. The attack only affects RSA keys and
can be mitigated by error correction in many common implementations of
SSH. 

 CACHEWARP AMD CPU ATTACK LETS HACKERS GAIN ROOT IN LINUX VMS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered a new exploit in AMD‚Äôs SEV protection.
SEV is designed to protect against malicious hypervisors by encrypting
VM data and protecting against its modification. This attack exploits
the ability to modify cache lines to a previous state which can allow
for manipulating authentication variables or return addresses.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GPTS AND ASSISTANTS API: DATA EXFILTRATION AND BACKDOOR RISKS IN CODE
INTERPRETER (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article talks about the new tools introduced by OpenAI on DevDay
and how they can be used to exfiltrate data and files, as well as
perform backdoor insertion using the Code Interpreter. Attackers may
be able to access personal files and manipulate code through malicious
prompts on websites, posing a threat to large populations. 

 PYTHON OBFUSCATION TRAPS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Developers have been targeted by malicious Python packages disguised
as legitimate obfuscation tools, with the most recent package being
"pyobfgood". The package has a destructive payload, "BlazeStealer",
that retrieves an additional malicious script from an external source,
enabling a Discord bot that gives attackers complete control over the
victim's computer. 

 TERRAFORM SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post provides an overview of Terraform and some common security
best practices. It covers auditing terraform manifest files (using
scanning tools), managing credentials and secrets, and creating and
using modules.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AWS LAUNCHES BLOCK PUBLIC SHARING OF EBS SNAPSHOTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 AWS has launched a new feature that allows for blocking of all or new
public sharing of EBS snapshots. EBS snapshots could be heavily
sensitive as they contain the full content of EBS disks. The setting
must be applied per region and per account. 

 SSO-SYNC-TO-AMAZON-RDS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A project for syncing users from AWS IAM Identity Center to an Amazon
RDS cluster. The project creates an Eventbridge rule that watches for
new users in IAM Identity Center that belong to a configured group and
then runs a Lambda function to create a new user in the RDS cluster.
The user will then be able to login to the database with their IAM
credentials. 

 CVE-HALF-DAY-WATCHER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 CVE Half Day Watcher is a tool for viewing vulnerabilities in the
public domain where the fix hasn't been released yet. This tool
intends to highlight the risk of early exposure of Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the public domain.

MISCELLANEOUS

 ACSC AND CISA RELEASE BUSINESS CONTINUITY IN A BOX (1 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have jointly launched Business
Continuity in a Box, a tool designed to help organizations quickly and
securely set up critical business functions during or after a cyber
attack. 

 POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY: IT‚ÄôS ALREADY HERE AND IT‚ÄôS NOT AS
SCARY AS IT SOUNDS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This article talks about the various approaches to Post-Quantum
Cryptography (PQC). PQC algorithms have been specially designed to
ensure information is kept safe in the future. There are currently
four main types of PQC algorithms: lattice-based, code-based,
multivariate polynomial, and hash-based. The article talks about how
lattice-based cryptography is straightforward but adds complexity. 

 NEW REPTAR CPU FLAW IMPACTS INTEL DESKTOP AND SERVER SYSTEMS (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Intel has patched CVE-2023-23583, also called a 'Redundant Prefix
Issue' or 'Reptar' by teams within Google that also independently
discovered it. CVE-2023-23583 can be exploited by attackers to
escalate privileges, gain access to sensitive information, or trigger
a denial of service state.

 POLICE TAKES DOWN BULLETPROFTLINK (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Malaysian police managed to dismantle the BulletProftLink
Phishing-as-a-service company in collaboration with the FBI and the
Australian Federal Police. As of April 2023, BulletProftLink was
estimated to have 8,138 subscribers with 327 phishing page templates.

boxes, and cybersecurity. 

 ETHEREUM FEATURE ABUSED TO STEAL $60 MILLION FROM 99K VICTIMS (2
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Malicious actors exploited Ethereum's Create2 function to bypass
wallet security alerts and steal $60 million worth of cryptocurrency
from 99,000 people in six months.
