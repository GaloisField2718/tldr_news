 A FIVE YEAR RETROSPECTIVE ON DETECTION AS CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Detection as Code is the concept of taking advantage of the codifying

detections in Sigma format. The future of Detection as Code lies in
utilizing test driven development and CI/CD pipelines as well as
utilizing LLMs to audit and improve context around detections.
