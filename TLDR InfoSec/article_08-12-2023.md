ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 KIDSECURITY‚ÄôS USER DATA COMPROMISED AFTER APP FAILED TO SET A
PASSWORD (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A popular parental control app for Android, KidSecurity, provides
parents with the ability to set app limits, track their children, and
listen to sounds around their children. Researchers discovered an
ElasticSearch instance belonging to the app that had no authentication
configured. This led to the exposure of private information including
phone numbers, email addresses, and portions of credit cards. 

 EXPERTS WARN OF SNEAKY FAKE LOCKDOWN MODE ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Jamf have discovered that an attacker could run a
trojan on a compromised iPhone running iOS 16 to hook into Lockdown
mode and bypass its security mechanisms. This post-exploitation
technique could allow an attacker to continue persisting on a
compromised device while providing users with a false sense of
security. Jamf notes that Lockdown mode was moved to the kernel level
in iOS 17 which would prevent their attack. 

 ATLASSIAN ANNOUNCES FIXES FOR FOUR CRITICAL RCE VULNERABILITIES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Atlassian has released fixes for four different vulnerabilities in
various products that each could be utilized to achieve RCE. The flaws
include a vulnerability in a third-party deserialization library, a
template injection flaw in Confluence, an Assets Discovery flaw that
could allow RCE on any machines with the agent installed, and a flaw
that could allow for RCE via WebSockets to bypass Atlassian
Companion‚Äôs blocklist and MacOS Gatekeeper.
