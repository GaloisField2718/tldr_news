 WEB ACCESS CONTROL SHOULD BE SIMPLE… (SPONSOR) [4] 

 …and if you're using ThreatLocker, it actually is.

→ ThreatLocker Web Control [4] is a built-in part of your endpoint
protection platform - no need for additional tools, portals, vendor
vetting, or integration headaches.

→ Go agentless to deploy fast - or use the ThreatLocker agent for
more control, more flexibility, and a better user experience.

→ Access to millions of data points to automatically identify
unknown sites and stop phishing attacks.

And there's much more than website blocking [4] here:
dynamically-updated site lists, compliance, advance website
categorization, support for unmanaged devices, and a great user
experience.

A few done-for-you network configurations are all it takes. Start here

READ) [9] 

 The Square team built an adaptive security layer on OPA for their

framework, allow for extensibility and exceptions, and be observable.

 CODE EXECUTION INSIDE PID 0 (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In Windows systems, PID 0 is a special process called the System Idle
Process, which contains threads that execute when no other thread is
ready to run on a given processor. The author of this post found that
they could swap the pointer inside any _KPRCB to run code in PID 0 via
the nt!PpmIdleSelectStates function. Hooking into PID 0 is
advantageous as traditional detection APIs and lookups will fail and
the execution does not require any system calls.
