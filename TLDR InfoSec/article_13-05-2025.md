 COMPANIES HAVE DOUBLED THEIR INVESTMENT IN INSIDER RISK SINCE 2023
— NEW DTEX + PONEMON INSTITUTE REPORT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Based on 8,306 interviews with security professionals, the new 2025
Cost of Insider Risks [5] report highlights the scope of the insider
threat problem, and the cost vs opportunity of insider risk
management.

Among other key findings, this year's Ponemon Institute report
reveals:

 	* The average cost of insider risk rose to $17.4M
 	* 81% of organizations have invested in an insider risk program
 	* 65% said their program was the only security strategy that
prevented a breach

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BALTIMORE AND NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESE ABUSE SURVIVORS POSSIBLY EXPOSED
IN CYBER INCIDENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Berkeley Research Group (BRG), a financial advisory firm working on
multiple church bankruptcy cases, has disclosed a data breach. BRG was
involved in at least ten bankruptcy cases involving dioceses and
archdioceses nationwide. 

 EDUCATION GIANT PEARSON HIT BY CYBERATTACK EXPOSING CUSTOMER DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pearson has reported that an attacker breached its systems and stole
“legacy” data. Other sources revealed that the stolen data was
obtained via an exposed .git/config file containing a GitLab Personal
Access Token (PAT), which was used to obtain hardcoded secrets for
cloud platforms and data stores from source code. The stolen data
allegedly contains customer information, financials, support tickets,
and source code. 

 CISCO FIXES MAX SEVERITY IOS XE FLAW LETTING ATTACKERS HIJACK DEVICES
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cisco has released fixes for a maximum severity (10.0 CVSS score)
vulnerability affecting IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers.
The devices utilize a hardcoded JWT that could allow unauthenticated
attackers to exploit the AP image download interface to upload files,
perform path traversal, or execute arbitrary code. Only devices with
the “Out-of-Band AP Image Download” feature, which allows APs to
download AP's OS images via HTTPS, are vulnerable.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I RUINED MY VACATION BY REVERSE ENGINEERING WSC (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 In this blog post, the author recounts creating defendnot, a Windows
Defender disabling tool, after his previous project faced a DMCA
takedown. The twist in the story is that he built it while traveling
and got inspired while in Seoul, which made him seek to develop a
"clean" implementation using Windows Security Center API. 

 SCIM HUNTING - BEYOND SSO (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post explores SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity
Management), detailing its core components, potential security
vulnerabilities, and common implementation issues. It provides
insights into authentication bypasses, token management risks, user
re-provisioning flaws, and potential account takeover scenarios in
identity management systems. 

 PHISHING DESPITE FIDO, LEVERAGING A NOVEL TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE
DEVICE CODE FLOW (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Enforcing FIDO as the sole MFA is often seen as phishing resistant.
However, this post shows a new attack that utilizes the OAuth 2.0
Device Code Flow to downgrade MFA. The Device Code Flow enables a user
to authenticate devices. In this method, an attacker uses a headless
browser to automate the Device Code Flow, allowing the user to be
phished through an attacker-controlled link without entering the code.

 DOGE BRO KYLE SCHUTT'S COMPUTER INFECTED BY MALWARE, CREDENTIALS
FOUND IN STEALER LOGS (3 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Micah Lee searched for DOGE employee Kyle Schutt's personal Gmail
address on Have I Been Pwned and found that he appeared in 51 breaches
and five pastes. Notably, Schutt's credentials appeared in
info-stealer logs, meaning that a device belonging to him was infected
with info-stealer malware at some point. Schutt has access to FEMA's
core financial systems. DOGE has not confirmed if employees are using
work or personal devices. 

 DRAG AND PWND: LEVERAGE ASCII CHARACTERS TO EXPLOIT VS CODE (4 MINUTE
READ) [22] 

 Zakhar Fedotkin found that ASCII control characters such as SOH
(\x01) and ETX (\x03) can be exploited in Visual Studio Code to run
arbitrary commands via node-pty, which sends raw bytes to the shell.
The vulnerability exploits two vectors: injecting control characters
into run configuration files and creating maliciously named files that
execute commands when dragged into VS Code's terminal. This issue
impacts macOS and Ubuntu systems, where control characters are
permitted in filenames, although Microsoft does not view it as a
security vulnerability due to measures like workspace trust warnings.
