STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RISK YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE: AWS SES AND EMAIL SPOOFING (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS SES allows sending emails using an individually verified email or
any email in a verified domain. If an attacker has the requisite IAM
privileges, they can spoof any email address in a verified domain for
phishing attacks and there is no ability to log emails sent. Use
verified emails or the "ses:FromAddress" condition in SES IAM policies
to prevent this attack.

 Kubernetes provides robust audit logs essential for investigations.

Flow Logs to address these issues.

 FORENSIC IMPLICATIONS OF APPLE'S “STOLEN DEVICE PROTECTION” (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The "Stolen Device Protection" feature was introduced in iOS 17.3 to
prevent unauthorized access to sensitive iPhone data. This feature
complicates data extraction for forensic experts by requiring
biometric authentication to pair with a computer, limiting traditional
extraction methods. Manual inspection may be the only viable forensic
method for devices protected by this feature, but it has limitations
and is not forensically sound.
