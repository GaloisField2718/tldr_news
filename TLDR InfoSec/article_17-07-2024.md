 CLOUD ATTACK EMULATION: DEMOCRATIZING SECURITY OPERATIONS IN THE
CLOUD (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security operations in the cloud are particularly complex as they
require operators to have knowledge of security operations as well as
cloud security. Cloud attack emulation can be the bridge needed as it
allows teams to stress test their infrastructure against attacks. It
can be utilized for cloud penetration testing, red/purple teaming,
incident response readiness, and security assurance. 

 AWS NETWORK FIREWALL EGRESS FILTERING CAN BE EASILY BYPASSED (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS Network Firewall is a fully managed service that works as an
IDS/IPS to control egress between workloads running in a VPC and the
Internet. AWS recommends the use of a domain list to allow specific
domains that can be contacted. This post demonstrates that this
security measure can be trivially bypassed by spoofing the host name
to avoid the block as it doesn't utilize DNS lookups or IP blocking.
