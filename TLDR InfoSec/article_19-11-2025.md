ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ECHOGRAM FLAW BYPASSES GUARDRAILS IN MAJOR LLMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 EchoGram is a technique that exploits training data gaps in LLM
guardrails by injecting “flip tokens” (nonsensical strings, such
as “=coffee”) that cause both false positives and bypasses of
safety controls in GPT-5.1, Claude, and Gemini. The attack is
effective against both LLM-as-judge and classification-based
guardrails. Researchers estimate that attackers can replicate the
method within three months. Security teams face dual threats -
malicious prompts that bypass defenses and legitimate requests being
falsely flagged - leading to alert fatigue in critical sectors such as
finance and healthcare. 

 SURVEILLANCE TECH PROVIDER PROTEI WAS HACKED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Protei, a Russian telecom company that develops technology to enable
phone and internet companies to conduct web surveillance and
censorship, was hacked. The attackers defaced its website and stole
182GB of data, including confidential emails. The threat actor defaced
the website with the message “another DPI/SORM provider bites the
dust,” referring to the company's sales of deep packet inspection
and other internet filtering technologies developed for the Russian
lawful intercept system. 

 PRINCETON UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH IMPACTS ALUMNI, STUDENTS, EMPLOYEES
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Princeton University disclosed a data breach after a hacker accessed
a database with personal details of alumni, donors, faculty, students,
and parents. The attack, traced to a phishing call, compromised
information like names, addresses, emails, and donation records, but
not passwords or financial data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I OVERLOOKED THE PROBLEM AND SHOT MYSELF IN THE FOOT (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This author disabled and deleted Identity & Access Management (IAM)
users before updating associated Terraform state and key policies
while migrating from legacy IAM users to SSO in an AWS environment,
inadvertently locking access to an AWS KMS key. Terraform applied
changes but masked the fact that the EKS cluster continued to use the
orphaned key, causing permission failures and locking out key
management until AWS Support intervened. Security teams should ensure
IAM and key-policy transitions are sequenced and validated, maintain
Terraform state accuracy, and treat KMS keys as high-risk break-glass
resources during cloud IAM migrations. 

 THE REALITIES OF CISO BURNOUT AND EXHAUSTION (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CISOs are facing a surge in burnout driven by accelerating threats,
shrinking budgets, and increasing executive accountability for
breaches. The evolving role now spans governance, risk, crisis
management, and business strategy, creating sustained cognitive load
and operational fatigue that raises organizational and even
national-security risk. Security leaders should prioritize realistic
resourcing, delegation, mental-health sustainability, and board-level
alignment to ensure that essential defensive capabilities do not
degrade under chronic pressure. 

 STEALING MICROSOFT TEAMS ACCESS TOKENS IN 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Microsoft Teams stores its auth_cookie in a DPAPI-encrypted value in
the Cookie database of the embedded Chromium browser used by Teams.
The key used to encrypt the cookie can be retrieved from the Local
State file in the Teams cache and used in conjunction with the nonce
to decrypt the auth_cookie using AES-256-GCM. This auth_cookie can
then be used with GraphSpy to retrieve and send messages on Teams.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 🆕 STRONGDM LAUNCHES LEASH: OPEN-SOURCE POLICY ENFORCEMENT FOR AI
AGENTS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 AI agents are the fastest-growing class of identity. They're
connecting to tools and systems 24/7 - requiring a new approach to
access control. Leash is StrongDM's new open-source project [13] that
extends runtime control to agentic systems. Leash works at kernel
level (<1ms latency overhead) to evaluate agent activity against
human-readable guardrails. Read the blog [13] 

 SAMDUMP (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This tool extracts offline Windows SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry
hives and parses them to extract hashed credentials for analysis. It's
intended for use by red-team or forensic practitioners to recover
NTLM/LM hashes for further brute force or audit activities. Infosec
professionals should treat any accessible hives as a high-risk
indicator, ensure live system backup integrity, enforce privilege
separation for hive access, and validate detection around unusual hive
reads or exfiltration. 

 NUDGE SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Nudge Security helps organizations secure SaaS and AI usage by
providing real-time visibility, risk detection, and automated policy
enforcement. It uncovers risky integrations, monitors AI/data access,
and addresses identity security gaps across apps and users. 

 90DAYSOFCYBERSECURITY (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 This repository contains a 90-day cybersecurity study plan, along
with resources and materials for learning various cybersecurity
concepts and technologies. The plan is organized into daily tasks and
covers topics such as Network+, Security+, Linux, Python, Traffic
Analysis, Git, ELK, AWS, Azure, and Hacking.

 IRANIAN HACKERS TARGET DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN ONGOING
CAMPAIGN (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 APT42 (aka SpearSpecter) targets senior defense/government officials
through social engineering, extending attacks to victims' family
members to increase pressure. The campaign deploys TameCat malware, a
PowerShell backdoor using Telegram/Discord for C&C that performs
reconnaissance, credential theft, and data exfiltration while evading
detection through in-memory execution and obfuscation. 

 WIDESPREAD CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE BLAMED ON MYSTERIOUS TRAFFIC SPIKE (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A major Cloudflare outage temporarily knocked many major websites and
platforms offline due to a spike in unusual traffic, which overwhelmed
a configuration file and caused core systems to crash. Although not
caused by an attack, the outage impacted services like X, ChatGPT,
Amazon, and Spotify. 

 CISA, EYEING CHINA, PLANS HIRING SPREE TO REBUILD ITS DEPLETED RANKS
(3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Given a 40% vacancy rate in pivotal areas, CISA has announced plans
to increase hiring in 2026 to replace its depleted workforce and
remain competitive. CISA will prioritize hiring liaisons between CISA
and critical infrastructure, as well as utilize the DHS's Cyber Talent
Management system. CISA will also offer exemptions to its
return-to-office policy and strengthen partnerships with colleges and
universities to attract top talent.
