 THE TRUTH ABOUT VPNS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VPNs create encrypted tunnels that protect your online activity from
snooping ISPs and hackers. While they mask your location and bypass

 WHAT IS DETECTION AS CODE? HOW TO IMPLEMENT DETECTION-AS-CODE (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Detection as Code (DaC) applies software engineering principles to
security detections, making them version-controlled, tested, and
automated like regular code. This approach addresses problems like
untraceable changes, silent detection failures, and alert floods that
plague traditional SIEM-based detection workflows. DaC consists of
five components: process management with agile methodologies,
expressive languages for complex logic, reusable components, version
control with Git as source of truth, and CI/CD pipelines with
comprehensive testing.
