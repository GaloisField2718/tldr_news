 HOW FLASHPOINT EXTRACTS THREAT INTELLIGENCE FROM CHAT MESSAGES, PASTE
SITES, AND ILLICIT MARKETPLACES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Trawling through web data can help you stay one step ahead of
attackers - from identifying stolen credentials to knowing when your
brand is mentioned in hacking forums.

But, how do you manage that? Is it scalable?

As the global leader in threat intelligence [4], Flashpoint helps
customers such as Microsoft, Bank of America, and Target detect
critical threats in the open and obscure web.

The secret sauce?

→ A continuously-updated database [4] spanning 41Bn stolen
credentials, 5.2Bn chat messages, 64M paste site articles, and 1.2B
illicit marketplace elements.

→ Human expertise and AI analysis that translate petabytes of
unstructured data into a clear view of breach, fraud, identity,
technical, and vulnerability threats.
