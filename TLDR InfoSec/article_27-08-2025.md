 THE BUDGET-FRIENDLY GUIDE TO IMPROVING NETWORK SECURITY (SPONSOR) [4]


 Small and medium-sized businesses face the same cyber threats as
large enterprises, but don't have $100K+ to drop on security
solutions. Remote work has made this worse, with endpoints scattered
across unsecured networks - rendering traditional perimeter security
obsolete.

That leaves SMBs with one main line of defense: business VPN [4].
Unlike firewalls or antivirus software that tackle single attack
vectors, a VPN creates encrypted tunnels for all traffic while
establishing secure perimeters regardless of employee location.

Learn about the common threats SMBs face, and how they can tackle them
affordably with business VPN. Get the free guide: _The Security
Supersolution Every Business Can Afford_ [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ROWHAMMER ATTACK CAN BACKDOOR AI MODELS WITH ONE DEVASTATING BIT FLIP
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ONEFLIP is a Rowhammer-based attack that can insert backdoors into AI
models by flipping just a single bit in DRAM memory during inference.
The attack targets vulnerable weights in the final classification
layer of neural networks, allowing attackers to craft imperceptible
trigger patterns that cause catastrophic misclassification (such as
making self-driving cars misidentify stop signs as speed limit signs)
while maintaining normal model accuracy for other inputs. It requires
access to a white-box model and co-location on the target machine with
DDR3/DDR4 memory, making it particularly concerning for multi-tenant
cloud platforms and AI inference servers. 

 CISA WARNS OF ACTIVELY EXPLOITED GIT CODE EXECUTION FLAW (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A new arbitrary code execution flaw in Git is being actively
exploited. The vulnerability stems from Git mishandling carriage
return characters in configuration files, which can lead to incorrect
submodule path resolution. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by
publishing repositories with submodules that end in a carriage return
(\r) and creating a crafted symlink with a malicious hook set up. 

 HEALTHCARE SERVICES GROUP DATA BREACH IMPACTS 624,000 (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A cyberattack on Healthcare Services Group exposed the personal data
of over 624,000 people, including Social Security numbers and
financial info, in late 2024. No identity theft has been reported, but
victims have been offered free credit monitoring.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AGENTIC BROWSER SECURITY: INDIRECT PROMPT INJECTION IN PERPLEXITY
COMET (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An indirect prompt injection vulnerability in Perplexity Comet allows
attackers to embed malicious instructions in webpage content,
hijacking AI assistants and stealing sensitive data across
authenticated sessions. The attack exploits Comet's inability to
distinguish between user instructions and untrusted webpage content,
allowing attackers to extract OTPs, access banking accounts, and
perform unauthorized actions without the user's knowledge. Defenders
should implement clear separation between user commands and webpage
content, require explicit user confirmation for sensitive actions, and
isolate agentic browsing from regular browsing sessions. 

 ENUMERATING AWS THE QUIET WAY: CLOUDTRAIL-FREE DISCOVERY WITH
RESOURCE EXPLORER (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DataDog discovered a now-patched enumeration technique for AWS that
evades CloudTrail logging. AWS Resource Explorer is a service that
provides a web-search-like interface for discovering resources in an
account. The researchers found that the ListResources API call was
previously categorized as a data event and, therefore, did not log to
CloudTrail by default. AWS reclassified the call as a management
event, which logs to CloudTrail by default, after DataDog alerted it
to this technique. 

 TRACKING MALICIOUS CODE EXECUTION IN PYTHON (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses techniques that cyber attackers use to hide
malicious code execution in Python, focusing on the obfuscation of
dangerous functions such as exec and eval. It explains how attackers
bypass security tools using methods such as homoglyphs, built-in
modules, variable reassignment, import tricks, and code obfuscation
(e.g., with base64). The article introduces a static analysis library
that detects these tricks, highlighting that tracking such abuses is
challenging. It emphasizes the importance of combining automated
analysis with human review for effective defense.

 WHY SIEM RULES FAIL AND HOW TO FIX THEM: INSIGHTS FROM 160 MILLION
ATTACK SIMULATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Picus Blue Report 2025 analyzed 160 million attack simulations
and found organizations detect only 1 out of 7 attacks, with 50% of
failures attributed to log collection issues, including source
coalescing, unavailable log sources, and network disruptions.
Additional failure causes include rule misconfigurations (13%) and
performance bottlenecks (24%) from resource-heavy rules and
inefficient queries that overwhelm systems. Organizations must
implement continuous validation through breach and attack simulation
to test rules against evolving TTPs, optimize log collection
pipelines, and tune detection thresholds to close critical security
gaps. 

 BLISTERING WYDEN LETTER SEEKS REVIEW OF FEDERAL COURT CYBERSECURITY,
CITING ‘INCOMPETENCE,' ‘NEGLIGENCE' (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Senator Ron Wyden demanded that Chief Justice Roberts authorize an
independent cybersecurity review of federal courts following
allegations that Russian hackers had stolen sealed case data from
systems with vulnerabilities that had been left unfixed for five
years. Wyden criticized the judiciary's failure to implement mandatory
cybersecurity requirements, slow adoption of phishing-resistant
multifactor authentication, and a pattern of stonewalling
congressional oversight about previous breaches. The letter highlights
systemic cybersecurity failures in the handling of critical government
infrastructure, including classified national security documents and
sealed criminal investigations. 

 SALESLOFT BREACHED TO STEAL OAUTH TOKENS FOR SALESFORCE DATA-THEFT
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Hackers breached the sales automation platform Salesloft to steal
OAuth and refresh tokens via its Drift chat agent integration with
Salesforce. Salesloft's SalesDrift platform connects the Drift AI chat
agent with a Salesforce instance, allowing organizations to sync
conversations, leads, and support cases into their CRM. Salesloft
determined that this breach only impacted customers who use the
Drift-Salesforce integration and has worked with Salesforce to revoke
all active sessions and refresh tokens for the Drift application.
