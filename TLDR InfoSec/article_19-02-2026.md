 BLOODHOUND SCENTRY — IDENTITY ATTACK PATH MANAGEMENT,
OPERATIONALIZED (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers don't go through your tools — they go around them,
chaining identity relationships to reach critical assets.

BLOODHOUND SCENTRY [4] pairs the BloodHound platform with SpecterOps
experts to continuously identify and disrupt identity attack paths
across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid environments.

White glove implementation. Privilege Zone configuration. Ongoing
graph analysis. Structured remediation planning.

This isn't more alerts. It's operationalized Identity APM.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK EMBEDS MALWARE IN ANDROID DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Keenadu is a firmware-level Android malware embedded via supply chain
compromise that hijacks Android's Zygote process to inject itself into
every app on infected devices. It affects 13,000 devices across
Russia, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and the Netherlands. Operating as a
multistage loader, Keenadu deploys modules targeting shopping
platforms such as Amazon and Temu, monitors Chrome queries, and
commits ad fraud. Organizations should cross-reference Kaspersky's
published IoCs against managed Android fleets. Firmware-level
infections require full firmware replacement, and system app
infections are mitigated by disabling or replacing the compromised
app. 

 SHINYHUNTERS ALLEGEDLY DROVE OFF WITH 1.7M CARGURUS RECORDS (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Cybercrime gang ShinyHunters has claimed the theft of 1.7 million
CarGurus corporate records, including personal and internal data, and
is extorting the company with a February 20 deadline. The crew has
chalked up 15 alleged breaches in 2026, hitting financial firms,
retail brands, car marketplaces, and dating platforms, often via
social engineering and SSO abuse.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 STOP THE CAP: MAKING ENTRA ID CONDITIONAL ACCESS MAKE SENSE OFFLINE
(18 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CAPSlock is an offline Conditional Access Policy (CAP) analysis
engine built on ROADrecon that simulates sign-in scenarios without
generating tenant artifacts and distinguishes between definitively
applied policies and signal-dependent ones. The tool addresses a
critical gap in Entra ID assessments, overlapping CAPs create
hard-to-reason enforcement behavior, particularly around MFA bypasses
and platform-specific policy gaps, by modeling normalization,
exclusion logic, and cumulative policy enforcement offline. Both red
teamers and defenders should evaluate CAPSlock for CAP auditing
workflows, with the caveat that pending AAD Graph deprecation will
require elevated Microsoft Graph permissions for future policy
collection. 

 CLICKFIX: STOPPED AT ⌘+V (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post details a lightweight macOS defense against ClickFix
attacks — now integrated into BlockBlock v2.3.0 — that intercepts
⌘+V keystrokes via NSEvent global monitoring, pauses the terminal
process with SIGSTOP, and prompts the user to review clipboard
contents before execution. The approach works across major terminal
emulators and is particularly effective given that most documented
ClickFix campaigns — including recent campaigns by North Korean APT
UNC1069 and LLM-propagated attacks — explicitly instruct victims to
use the keyboard shortcut. Notable limitations include no coverage for
right-click paste operations, a dependency on Accessibility
permissions, and Apple's Endpoint Security framework lacking an
equivalent ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_PASTE event, making user-space
interception the only practical approach. 

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE TRITON MALWARE FORK (13 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A suspicious fork of the Triton macOS omg.lol client turns out not to
be simple plagiarism, but a clumsy malware delivery attempt hosted on
GitHub. The attacker floods the README with links to a Windows-only
malware ZIP hidden in an Xcode asset path, then pads the GitHub
contribution graph with fake backdated commits to appear legitimate.
Sandbox analysis shows a multistage Windows infection chain using
7zip, LuaJIT, anti-analysis tricks, and C2 traffic masquerading as
Microsoft and blockchain traffic.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ADWSDOMAINDUMP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ADWSDomainDump is an Active Directory domain dumper that uses ADWS
(port 9389) instead of LDAP to enumerate AD objects, bypassing both
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and CrowdStrike Falcon detection. 

 NONO (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Nono is a secure, kernel-enforced sandbox for AI agents, MCP, and LLM
workloads. It features capability-based isolation with secure key
management and blocking of destructive actions in a zero-trust
environment. 

 COGENT SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Cogent Security is an agentic AI platform for vulnerability
management that autonomously investigates, prioritizes, and
orchestrates remediation of security issues.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PASSWORD MANAGERS LESS SECURE THAN PROMISED (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ETH Zurich's Applied Cryptography Group demonstrated 25 total attacks
across Bitwarden (12), LastPass (7), and Dashlane (6), collectively
serving ~60 million users breaking their "zero-knowledge encryption"
guarantees by operating a malicious server that deviates from expected
client behavior during routine actions such as login, vault access,
and sync. Attacks ranged from targeted vault integrity violations to
full organizational vault compromise, requiring only lightweight
server-impersonation tooling rather than significant computational
resources, with the root cause attributed to feature-bloat complexity
and reliance on obsolete 1990s-era cryptographic primitives. Security
teams should evaluate password manager vendors against criteria of
transparent vulnerability disclosure, third-party audits, and modern
end-to-end encryption enabled by default, pending publication of full
findings at USENIX Security 2026. 

 DUTCH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE THREATENS TO 'JAILBREAK' NATION'S F-35 JET
FIGHTERS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Dutch defense chief Gijs Tuinman suggests F-35 fighter software could
be “jailbroken,” raising sharp questions about European dependence
on US control systems and cloud services. The question is whether
there are hidden kill switches or how Lockheed's update and logistics
infrastructure can effectively ground fleets. 

 FROM BRICKSTORM TO GRIMBOLT: UNC6201 EXPLOITING A DELL RECOVERPOINT
FOR VIRTUAL MACHINES ZERO-DAY (11 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Mandiant and GTIG described how UNC6201 exploited CVE-2026-22769
(CVSS 10.0), a hardcoded admin credential in Dell RecoverPoint's
Apache Tomcat configuration located at
/home/kos/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml. This enabled unauthenticated
deployment of WAR files via/manager/text/deploy and allowed root-level
code execution. Persistence was maintained by hijacking
convert_hosts.sh, which is run at boot via rc.local. GRIMBOLT, a C#
backdoor replacing BRICKSTORM in September 2025, is compiled with
native AOT to remove CIL metadata, making static analysis more
difficult. It shares C2 infrastructure with its predecessor and
introduces new lateral movement techniques in VMware, such as using
"Ghost NICs" and iptables-based Single Packet Authorization on
compromised vCenter appliances. Defenders should review
/home/kos/auditlog/fapi_cl_audit_log.log for requests to /manager,
search for GRIMBOLT using published YARA rules and IOCs, immediately
apply Dell's patch, and monitor for changes to convert_hosts.sh.
