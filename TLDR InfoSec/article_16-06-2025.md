ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PALO ALTO NETWORKS FIXED MULTIPLE PRIVILEGE ESCALATION FLAWS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Palo Alto Networks fixed seven privilege escalation vulnerabilities
in its products, the most severe of which was CVE-2025-4232 (CVSS
7.1), which allows non-administrative macOS users to escalate
privileges to root through a wildcard vulnerability in GlobalProtect's
log collection feature. The company also patched two authenticated
admin command injection flaws in PAN-OS (CVE-2025-4231 and
CVE-2025-4230) that enabled authenticated administrators to execute
commands as root users. Palo Alto also integrated 11 Chrome security
patches and addressed a cache vulnerability in Prisma Access Browser.
There were no known active exploits of these vulnerabilities. 

 DISCORD INVITE LINK HIJACKING DELIVERS ASYNCRAT AND SKULD STEALER
TARGETING CRYPTO WALLETS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Attackers are exploiting Discord's invite system by hijacking expired
vanity links to redirect users from trusted sources to malicious
servers distributing AsyncRAT and Skuld Stealer malware targeting
cryptocurrency wallets. The attack, designed to harvest credentials
from Exodus and Atomic wallets via injection techniques, employs
ClickFix social engineering to trick users into running PowerShell
commands that download multi-stage payloads, followed by Skuld
Stealer. The campaign targets users in the US, Vietnam, France,
Germany, and other countries using trusted cloud services like GitHub,
Bitbucket, and Pastebin to blend malicious traffic with legitimate
communications. 

 PARAGUAY SUFFERED DATA BREACH: 7.4 MILLION CITIZEN RECORDS LEAKED ON
DARK WEB (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hackers leaked the personal data of 7.4 million people in Paraguay on
the dark web. A cybercriminal group called "Cyber PMC" demanded $7.4
million, blaming government corruption and poor security.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HUNTING THROUGH APIS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog compares three Microsoft security APIs for threat hunting:
Azure Monitor API, which queries Sentinel data only; Graph API, which
queries both Defender XDR and Sentinel data, and Defender ATP API,
which is limited to Defender for Endpoint data. The Graph API is
recommended as it offers unified access to both platforms and supports
more data types, while the Defender ATP API has notable limitations,
such as a 30-day query timeframe restriction. Each API needs specific
permissions and has different rate limits, with the Graph API allowing
over 45 calls per minute based on tenant size. 

 BUILDING UBER'S MULTI-CLOUD SECRETS MANAGEMENT PLATFORM TO ENHANCE
SECURITY (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Uber initially employed various secrets management practices and
vaults for different teams and clouds, which it consolidated into six
vaults under the purview of its Secrets team. The Secrets team created
scanners to perform real-time scanning and scheduled scanning to
identify secrets usage in chat apps and code, as well as built APIs
for automated secrets rotation from the centralized secrets vaults.
The team also developed a secrets exchange system to distribute
secrets to third-party vendors. 

 WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT MAINTENANCE IN DETECTION ENGINEERING? (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 With the movement of detection engineering towards a
detection-as-code model, detection engineers must also embrace
software maintenance requirements. Maintenance can be broken down into
four categories: corrective maintenance, which directly fixes an issue
that is occurring; adaptive maintenance, which adapts the detection to
changing requirements such as a new API; perfective maintenance, which
focuses on improving the query, documentation, or adding new features;
and preventative maintenance, which proactively seeks to address
issues before clients identify them. Although all detection
engineering teams must perform maintenance, there is a dearth of
information and posts discussing it.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PROTECTING HIGH-PROFILE INDIVIDUALS USING OSINT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Online threats against high-profile individuals can escalate into
real-world harassment or even physical harm. This is growing more
urgent due to geopolitical tensions, AI-powered deepfakes [11], and
exploitable vulnerabilities. Learn how to use OSINT to identify these
threats and take preventive action in Flashpoint's Complete Guide to
OSINT for Executive Protection [11]. 

 PRIVADO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Privado is an open-source static scanning tool that detects data
flows in your code, identifies data security vulnerabilities, and
generates Play Store Data Safety Reports. It identifies over 110
personal data elements and maps their flow from collection points to
"sinks" like external third parties, databases, logs, and internal
APIs. 

 CLOUDPEASS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Cloud Privilege Escalation Awesome Script Suite (CloudPEASS) is a
one-stop solution for enumerating permissions, sensitive data, and
privilege escalation vectors across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

 UNUSUAL TOOLSET USED IN RECENT FOG RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Fog ransomware operators attacked an Asian financial firm in May
using Syteca monitoring and pentesting tools GC2, Adaptix, and
Stowaway. They stayed in the network for two weeks before deploying
ransomware. The attackers maintained persistence post-attack and
utilized tools often linked to espionage, suggesting
intelligence-gathering motives with ransomware as a secondary goal.
Since May 2024, Fog ransomware has evolved from targeting US schools
through compromised VPNs to exploiting Veeam vulnerabilities and
shifted to email infections featuring provocative ransom notes mocking
Elon Musk's DOGE agency. 

 COMING TO APPLE OSES: A SEAMLESS WAY TO IMPORT AND EXPORT PASSKEYS (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple previewed a new import/export feature for passkeys at the most
recent WWDC. The new mechanism will fundamentally differ from current
credentials exports that utilize JSONs or CSVs, as it happens directly
between participating credentials manager apps without creating
insecure files. Data miners have discovered artifacts in newer
releases of the Google Authenticator app, suggesting that Google is
working on similar functionality for the Android ecosystem, but Google
has not announced the feature yet. 

 MENSTRUAL TRACKING APP DATA IS A ‘GOLD MINE' FOR ADVERTISERS THAT
RISKS WOMEN'S SAFETY (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers from the University of Cambridge highlight the risks
associated with cycle tracking apps (CTAs) and broad data collection
practices. CTAs regularly collect and sell sensitive data on women's
cycles to advertisers and tech giants without user consent. The
researchers are calling on governments to create non-profit, public
CTAs or at least require CTAs to offer fine-grained data collection
approvals.

but Microsoft is addressing the problem and has already implemented
some improvements.
