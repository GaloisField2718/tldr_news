ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 LET THEM EAT JUNK FOOD: MAJOR ORGANIC SUPPLIER TO WHOLE FOODS,
WALMART, HIT BY CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 United Natural Foods disclosed a cyberattack on June 5 that disrupted
operations and order fulfillment. The company activated incident
response protocols and took systems offline. This follows similar
recent attacks on grocery chains in the UK. 

 HACKER TARGETS OTHER HACKERS AND GAMERS WITH BACKDOORED GITHUB CODE
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Sophos detected a campaign in which an attacker uses GitHub
repositories with hidden backdoors to target other hackers and gamers.
The repositories use various loaders to deploy various payloads, such
as info-stealers and remote access trojans (RATs). Many of the fake
repositories are designed to target other hackers, but some also use
game cheats, mod tools, and fake exploits as lures. 

 MISCONFIGURED HMIS EXPOSE US WATER SYSTEM TO ANYONE WITH A BROWSER (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 While conducting a routine scan of industrial-control hosts, Censys
researchers discovered an uncommon TLS certificate configuration that
led to the discovery of a browser-based HMI platform. These
internet-exposed platforms could be used to view and control water
systems without authentication. Censys sent a bulk notification to the
EPA, and the number of systems that were either read-only or fully
controllable was reduced from 300 to 20.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EKS VS GKE - SECURITY (17 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An in-depth comparison of security features in EKS and GKE. The post
breaks down features by Identity and Access Management (IAM),
controlling network traffic, configuration/posture management,
vulnerability/supply-chain management, and runtime threat detection. 

 FOLLOW THE SMOKE | CHINA-NEXUS THREAT ACTORS HAMMER AT THE DOORS OF
TOP TIER TARGETS (16 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 SentinelOne observed and countered Chinese cyberespionage operations
targeting the company in 2024-2025, including PurpleHaze
reconnaissance and a ShadowPad intrusion via a hardware logistics
partner, but SentinelOne wasn't compromised. The broader campaigns
targeted 70+ organizations globally, including government, media, and
cybersecurity vendors. 

 OPEN-SOURCE TOOLKIT OF AN IVANTI CSA ATTACKER (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In late 2024, Ivanti released advisories for vulnerabilities in its
Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) product, which were discovered to be
part of an exploit chain against the products. In this post, Synacktiv
researchers break down three of the open-source tools they observed
used by attackers in post-exploitation activities on these devices and
provide YARA rules to detect them. The attacker planted Suo5 after the
initial compromise as a webshell to be used on an internet-facing
Exchange server. The attacker then established persistence using the
iox tunnel and attempted lateral movement using atexec.py to gain
remote code execution via Task Scheduler.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE FIXES BUG THAT COULD REVEAL USERS' PRIVATE PHONE NUMBERS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A security researcher discovered a Google bug that allowed attackers
to reveal any account's private recovery phone number in under 20
minutes without owner notification. The exploit bypassed anti-bot
protections through automated brute-force attacks. Google confirmed
the fix after the researcher disclosed the vulnerability in April. It
paid a $5,000 bounty and found no confirmed exploits occurred. 

 EXPLAINER FOR LOCAL NETWORK ACCESS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Chrome Secure Web and Network team has drafted a proposal to
require explicit permission for a site to access devices on the local
network. This proposal seeks to address a common attack vector in
which an attacker can use a CSRF vulnerability to attack a local
device such as a printer. The proposal would require any request that
seeks to access a more private IP space (such as public to private or
private to loop back) to obtain a new “Local Network Access”
permission from the user via a prompt. 

 LINUX FOUNDATION UNVEILS DECENTRALIZED WORDPRESS PLUGIN MANAGER (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Linux Foundation has launched the FAIR Package Manager, a new way
to manage WordPress plugins and themes. It was created after a major
conflict between WordPress companies Automattic and WP Engine. This
tool gives developers more control by offering a decentralized and
secure plugin system.

encryption approaches, and restricting cyber sanctions to foreign
threats only.
