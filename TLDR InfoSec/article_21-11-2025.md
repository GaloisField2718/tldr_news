ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TAMPEREDCHEF MALWARE SPREADS VIA FAKE SOFTWARE INSTALLERS IN ONGOING
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TamperedChef (aka BaoLoader) distributes JavaScript backdoors through
fake software installers signed with fraudulent certificates from
shell companies in the US, Panama, and Malaysia. Delivered via
malvertising and SEO poisoning targeting searches for PDF editors and
product manuals, the malware establishes persistence through scheduled
tasks that execute obfuscated JavaScript, which beacons encrypted
system data to C2 servers, with primary infections concentrated in US
healthcare, construction, and manufacturing sectors. Security teams
should implement application allowlisting, monitor for suspicious
scheduled tasks executing JavaScript payloads, validate code-signing
certificates against threat intelligence, and restrict access to
product manuals through authorized channels only. 

 SOLARWINDS PATCHES THREE CRITICAL SERV-U VULNERABILITIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 SolarWinds patched three critical vulnerabilities in the Serv-U
15.5.2.2.102 file transfer solution that allow attackers with admin
privileges to execute arbitrary code: CVE-2025-40549 (path restriction
bypass), CVE-2025-40548 (broken access control), and CVE-2025-40547
(logic error). All three flaws are rated medium severity on Windows
due to platform-specific differences in privilege and path handling.
Organizations using Serv-U should immediately upgrade to version
15.5.3, especially given SolarWinds' history of exploited
vulnerabilities with seven flaws already in CISA's KEV catalog. 

 ANOTHER SALESFORCE-LINKED DATA BREACH HAS SHINYHUNTERS' FINGERPRINTS
ALL OVER IT (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Salesforce reported a new data breach likely involving the
ShinyHunters group, who may have accessed customer data through
Gainsight apps connected to Salesforce. Upon discovery, Salesforce
revoked access tokens and removed the affected apps. Although no
vulnerability was found in Salesforce itself, Google analysts linked
the incident to prior token-related attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APPLICATION CONTAINMENT: HOW TO USE RINGFENCING TO PREVENT THE
WEAPONIZATION OF TRUSTED SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ringfencing extends application allowlisting by enforcing granular
containment policies on approved software, controlling file access,
registry modifications, inter-process communication, and network
activity to prevent “living off the land” attacks that weaponize
legitimate tools like PowerShell, Office macros, or scripting engines.
The technique blocks lateral movement, data exfiltration, and
ransomware encryption by restricting applications to only their
necessary functions, preventing them from spawning unauthorized child
processes or accessing sensitive directories. Implement ringfencing in
phases, starting with high-risk applications, use simulation mode to
identify legitimate use cases before enforcement, combine with
application allowlisting and storage controls, and continuously
monitor the unified audit for policy violations. 

 WHEN UPDATES BACKFIRE: RCE IN WINDOWS UPDATE HEALTH TOOLS (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Researchers at Eye Security uncovered a remote code execution flaw in
Microsoft's Update Health Tools (KB4023057), traced to abandoned Azure
blob storage. Attackers could trigger unintended code execution on
vulnerable devices by exploiting predictable blob names and weak
message security. Microsoft confirmed the issue, transferred ownership
of the exposed blobs, and improved protections in newer tool versions,
mitigating risks for most users. 

 IMDS ABUSED: HUNTING RARE BEHAVIORS TO UNCOVER EXPLOITS (9 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is a server that runs on cloud
VMs (like AWS EC2) to provide short-lived credentials to applications
running on them. To detect potential IMDS abuse, establish a baseline
of which services frequently access IMDS and then monitor for
applications that either access sensitive IMDS paths or access IMDS
more frequently than usual. This post applies this methodology to
hunting for a vulnerability in pandoc and Clickhouse.

 IRANIAN APT HACKS HELPED DIRECT MISSILE STRIKES IN ISRAEL AND THE RED
SEA (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Imperial Kitten (aka Tortoiseshell/TA456) conducted cyber
reconnaissance on maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS)
tracking data days before Houthi missile strikes on Red Sea shipping
in February 2024, demonstrating direct correlation between IRGC-linked
cyber espionage and kinetic targeting operations. Amazon's threat
intelligence indicates this represents an evolution in hybrid warfare
where cyber operations provide target reconnaissance for physical
attacks, with the traditional boundaries between digital and kinetic
operations dissolving. Security teams should monitor for anomalous
access to critical infrastructure location/tracking systems, implement
enhanced logging and behavioral analytics on these systems, and
coordinate with physical security teams to correlate cyber
reconnaissance patterns with potential kinetic threat indicators. 

 OBSCURE MCP API IN COMET BROWSER BREACHES USER TRUST, ENABLING FULL
DEVICE CONTROL VIA AI BROWSERS (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 SquareX researchers exposed a hidden MCP API
(chrome.perplexity.mcp.addStdioServer) in the Comet browser that
enables embedded extensions to execute arbitrary local commands
without user consent, thereby bypassing decades of established browser
security principles. The API is accessible via Comet's Agentic
extension, triggered by perplexity.ai, creating a catastrophic
third-party risk where a single XSS vulnerability or a compromised
Perplexity employee could grant attackers complete device control over
all Comet users. Security teams should audit AI browser deployments,
demand API disclosure from vendors, require third-party security
audits, and ensure users can disable embedded extensions that are
currently hidden from extension dashboards. 

 HOW THE CLASSIC ANIME 'GHOST IN THE SHELL' PREDICTED THE FUTURE OF
CYBERSECURITY 30 YEARS AGO (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Set decades ahead of its time, "Ghost in the Shell" envisioned a
world where cyber-attacks, government-sanctioned hackers, and
AI-driven threats are commonplace. It foresaw issues like digital
privacy risks, behavioral cyber-profiling, and tech-enabled abuse,
ideas that now define modern cybersecurity.
