A MAGENTO-BASED E-STORES (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

card skimmer malware on Magento-based e-stores, according to Sucuri
researchers. The malware hides in a website's database and steals
credit card information entered during the checkout process, sending
it to the attackers' server. This sophisticated attack demonstrates
how criminals are using legitimate platforms like GTM to deploy
malicious code that is difficult to detect. 

 NEW HACK USES PROMPT INJECTION TO CORRUPT GEMINI LONG-TERM MEMORY (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Many of the major LLMs have protections against basic prompt
injection however researcher Johann Rehberger unveiled a new indirect
prompt injection technique that utilizes delayed tool injection. In
Rehberger's attack, Gemini is instructed to download and summarize a
website, the summary that Gemini creates includes a covert request to
take specific actions if the user responds with specific trigger
words, once the user replies with the trigger word the instruction is
saved to Gemini's long term memory. Google has responded that it will
not fix the issue.

 SECURE SANITIZATION AND DISPOSAL OF STORAGE MEDIA (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Guidance from the UK's NCSC on how to properly sanitize or dispose of
storage media for non-classified data. For devices that can be
sanitized, if the device is encrypted (such as with FileVault or
BitLocker) disposing of the cryptographic keys may be sufficient
whereas devices that are unencrypted should be overwritten with a
fixed value and then have the value read back after reboot. For
devices that cannot be sanitized, they should be physically destroyed
to pieces of a size smaller than 6nm.
