 SHIFTING THE GRC NARRATIVE — A LIVE PANEL FEATURING DRATA, VIDYARD,
AND AWS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Compliance is often seen as a blocker: of new deals, international
expansion, or engineering resources. But leading companies are
shifting the narrative around GRC— from a cost center into a revenue
driver.

Join Drata's webinar on August 27 [4] to hear compliance leaders from
Drata, Eden Data, Vidyard, and AWS on:

 	* Reducing customer acquisition costs through automated compliance
 	* Accelerating sales cycles by cutting security review timelines
 	* Enabling rapid market expansion with continuous audit-readiness
 	* Measuring GRC's direct impact on revenue [4]
 	* Pitching GRC as an investment to your board

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 INTERLOCK RANSOMWARE GROUP LEAKS 43GB OF DATA IN CITY OF ST. PAUL
CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Interlock ransomware group attacked the City of St. Paul,
disrupting payments and essential services. The city refused to pay
the ransom and launched Operation Secure St. Paul with support from
the FBI and National Guard while investigating the breach. Interlock
claims to have leaked 43GB of HR, financial, and identification
documents, prompting a citywide password reset and warnings about
increased phishing risks. 

 HACKERS LEAK 2.8M SENSITIVE RECORDS FROM ALLIANZ LIFE IN SALESFORCE
DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat actors linked to ShinyHunters have leaked 2.8 million records
from Allianz Life's Salesforce CRM, exposing personal details
including names, addresses, birth dates, and Tax IDs of customers and
business partners. The July 16 breach occurred through social
engineering attacks targeting the third-party cloud CRM system,
affecting the majority of Allianz Life's 1.4 million customers. The
attackers have formed a joint Telegram channel with other groups,
including Scattered Spider and Lapsus$, to claim credit for this and
other major Salesforce-related breaches. 

 NEW DOWNGRADE ATTACK CAN BYPASS FIDO AUTH IN MICROSOFT ENTRA ID (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 ProofPoint researchers discovered a new downgrade attack on Entra ID
that downgrades the MFA from FIDO to a less secure fallback. The
attack uses a custom evilgnix attacker-in-the-middle module to spoof a
browser agent that lacks FIDO support, such as Safari for Windows. It
can be prevented by disabling fallback methods.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DETECTION ENGINEERING: PRACTICING DETECTION-AS-CODE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This is part one of an ongoing series on implementing
detection-as-code (DaC). It introduces core concepts such as the
detection development life cycle (DDLC) and components of DaC, such as
version control, code review, testing, and CI/CD pipelines.
Organizations that embrace DaC can collaborate more easily, have more
consistent, efficient, and higher quality detections, have better
documentation, and can scale more effectively. 

 WHAT THE LOCKBIT 4.0 LEAK REVEALS ABOUT RAAS GROUPS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 LockBit 4.0's leaked affiliate panel exposes a fragmented, chaotic
RaaS operation: inconsistent negotiations, broken decryptors, unpaid
platform fees, and even hits on prohibited Russian targets. This
unpredictability complicates defense and incident response. The
takeaway: don't rely on negotiation—prioritize preparation
(segmentation, MFA, patching, and lateral-movement monitoring), as
RaaS brands splinter and attribution grows harder. 

 LESSONS LEARNED BUILDING AN AI HACKER (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post dives into how Theori built effective LLM agents for
DARPA's AI Cyber Challenge. The agents worked by breaking problems
into sub-tasks, carefully curating narrow, guarded tools and enforcing
structured outputs while specialized sub-agents handled recurring jobs
like source questions and PoV debugging.

 RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HACKERS SAID TO BE BEHIND US FEDERAL COURT FILING
SYSTEM HACK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Officials blame Russian government hackers for breaching the U.S.
federal court filing system (PACER), reportedly searching mid-level
criminal cases, including some with Russian/Eastern European surnames,
with stolen data including sealed dockets and informant identities.
The judiciary confirmed the cyberattack and is enhancing security. 

 NEW YORK CLAIMS ZELLE'S SHODDY SECURITY ENABLED A BILLION DOLLARS IN
SCAMS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Zelle's owner, Early
Warning Services, alleging the platform's weak verification and
safeguards enabled over $1 billion in scams through 2023. The suit
cites lax registration, slow fraud reporting, misleading “safe”
marketing, and poor scammer removal. Zelle says the suit is a
political stunt and claims it has strong anti-fraud efforts. 

 WHY IT'S TIME FOR THE U.S. TO GO ON OFFENSE IN CYBERSPACE (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The US indicated a shift from strictly defensive capabilities to
increasing offensive capabilities with the allocation of $1B in
funding for offensive operations that was included in the “Big
Beautiful Bill.” This funding will allow the US to operationalize
offensive tooling more rapidly and develop the infrastructure to
support more complex operations. Defensive deterrents have not been
effective enough in cyberwarfare. This shift to offensive deterrents
is necessary to maintain US cyber supremacy.
