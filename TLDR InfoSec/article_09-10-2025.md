 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS... WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Phishing isn't just emails anymore. It's AI-generated voices, videos,
and deepfakes that sound and _look_ exactly like your executives. They
can fool almost anyone - including you and your coworkers.

Backed by $55M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z, Adaptive Security is
the first security awareness platform built to fight AI-powered social
engineering [4]. Adaptive _rewires_ instincts. Here's how:

 	* Deepfake phishing simulations featuring company executives in
real-world attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, customizable training content tailored for each
employee (500+ resources)
 	* AI-driven risk engine that uses your publicly available data
adversaries can exploit

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DRAFTKINGS WARNS OF ACCOUNT BREACHES IN CREDENTIAL STUFFING ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 DraftKings disclosed a credential stuffing attack where threat actors
used stolen username/password combinations from external breaches to
gain unauthorized access to customer accounts, exposing names,
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and partial payment card
information. The company is requiring affected users to reset
passwords and enable multi-factor authentication. This is DraftKings'
second major credential stuffing incident since 2022, when attackers
previously stole up to $300,000 from compromised accounts. The attack
highlights the ongoing vulnerability of organizations to credential
reuse attacks, where users' poor password hygiene across multiple
platforms enables account takeovers even when the targeted company's
own systems remain secure. 

 RAINWALK PET INSURANCE EXPOSES 158 GB OF US CUSTOMER AND PET DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Rainwalk Pet Insurance exposed 158 GB of unprotected customer data
containing 85,361 files, including pet insurance claims, veterinary
bills, customer names, addresses, phone numbers, partial credit card
numbers, and pet medical histories with microchip numbers. Security
researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered the misconfigured database and
notified the company, but it remained publicly accessible for nearly a
month before being secured. The breach creates significant fraud risks
as criminals could exploit the combined pet and owner data to submit
fraudulent insurance claims, intercept Venmo refunds, or conduct
targeted scams using legitimate claim information and emotional
manipulation tactics. 

 SALESFORCE SAYS IT WON'T PAY EXTORTION DEMAND IN 1 BILLION RECORDS
BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Salesforce has refused to pay a crime group calling itself Scattered
LAPSUS$ Hunters, which claims to have stolen about 1 billion records
from major clients. The hackers used social engineering to breach
Salesforce portals and threatened to leak customer data unless paid.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW RESEARCH: AI IS ALREADY THE #1 DATA EXFILTRATION CHANNEL IN THE
ENTERPRISE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LayerX research reveals AI has become the #1 corporate data
exfiltration channel, with 45% of enterprise employees using
generative AI tools and 67% accessing them through unmanaged personal
accounts outside IT control. The primary threat vector is the use of
copy/paste operations in AI platforms, with employees performing an
average of 14 pastes per day via personal accounts, and at least three
of these containing sensitive data, such as PII or PCI information.
Traditional DLP tools miss this threat entirely since they're designed
for file-based environments, while 40% of files uploaded to GenAI
tools contain sensitive data, and 77% of employees paste corporate
data directly into these platforms. 

 CYBERCRIME OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONTLINES: UNC6040 PROACTIVE
HARDENING RECOMMENDATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 UNC6040 is a financially motivated threat group that utilizes voice
phishing (vishing) to deceive employees into authorizing malicious
Salesforce Data Loader applications, thereby enabling large-scale data
theft from corporate Salesforce instances. The attackers impersonate
IT support personnel to manipulate victims into granting OAuth access
to fake connected apps, then systematically exfiltrate sensitive data
using legitimate Salesforce tools. Organizations should implement
phishing-resistant MFA, restrict API access to approved applications
only, enforce network-based login restrictions, and deploy real-time
detection rules that monitor for suspicious OAuth authorizations
followed by bulk data exports. 

 LOOK MOM HR APPLICATION LOOK MOM NO JOB (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Cybercriminals are now exploiting trusted collaboration platforms,
such as Zoom, to execute highly convincing phishing attacks. By
sending what appears to be legitimate HR documents via Zoom, attackers
redirect recipients to a fake “bot protection” page and then to a
Gmail login imitation designed to steal credentials. Credentials
entered on this page are exfiltrated in real-time over a WebSocket
connection, allowing attackers to validate and use them swiftly.

 NEW MIC-E-MOUSE ATTACK SHOWS COMPUTER MICE CAN CAPTURE CONVERSATIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The "Mic-E-Mouse" attack is where high-precision computer mice can
function as unintended listening devices by detecting minute desk
vibrations caused by sound waves through their sensitive optical
sensors. The attack converts mouse movement data into audio signals
using machine learning, achieving 42-61% speech recognition accuracy
without requiring malware installation—only access to normal mouse
data packets. This side-channel attack illustrates how increasingly
sensitive hardware can create unexpected privacy vulnerabilities,
particularly as high-DPI gaming mice become more widespread and
affordable. 

 GERMANY SLAMS BRAKES ON EU'S CHAT CONTROL DEVICE-SCANNING SNOOPFEST
(7 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Germany's government has decided to block the EU's Chat Control
regulation, which aimed to compel messaging services to scan all user
chats—including those on encrypted platforms—for child abuse
material. This stance creates a crucial blocking minority, likely
ending the proposal, as it reflects the widespread concerns about
privacy, democracy, and digital rights from major tech and privacy
advocacy organizations. 

 DISRUPTING MALICIOUS USES OF AI: OCTOBER 2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenAI highlights recent efforts to block malicious use of AI,
targeting scams, cybercrime, and manipulation by various threat
actors. Most attackers use AI to accelerate existing tactics, rather
than invent new attacks, so OpenAI has banned accounts that violate
their safe usage policies.
