ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EXPLOIT DETAILS FOR MAX SEVERITY CISCO IOS XE FLAW NOW PUBLIC (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Cisco disclosed vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-20188) in IOS XE for
Catalyst Wireless Controllers and APs. The vendor indicated that a
hard-coded JSON Web Token (JWT) allows unauthenticated remote
attackers to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute
commands with root privileges. CVE-2025-20188 is only dangerous if the
'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature is enabled on the Wireless
Controllers. 

 INTERLOCK RANSOMWARE DEPLOYS NEW NODESNAKE RAT IN UK ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Interlock ransomware group has deployed a Remote Access Trojan
(RAT) called NodeSnake in attacks on two UK universities over two
months. NodeSnake enables attackers to control infected computers,
access files, monitor activity, and install additional malware while
remaining undetected. It emerged in September 2024 and previously
targeted large organizations in North America and Europe. Interlock
now focuses on educational institutions and local governments,
possibly to steal intellectual property and test new attack methods. 

 NEW LINUX FLAWS ALLOW PASSWORD HASH THEFT VIA CORE DUMPS IN UBUNTU,
RHEL, FEDORA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Two race condition vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-5054 and CVE-2025-4598)
in Linux dump handlers enable local attackers to steal password hashes
and sensitive data from crashed privileged processes. These flaws
affect apport in Ubuntu and systemd-coredump in Red Hat and Fedora,
allowing attackers to exploit SUID programs via timing attacks that
replace crashed processes with malicious ones to access core dumps.
Organizations can mitigate risk by disabling core dumps for SUID
binaries with "echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable" until patches are
applied.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DEMONSTRABLY SECURE SOFTWARE SUPPLY CHAINS WITH NIX (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Nix enables secure software supply chains by providing verifiable
proofs of the sources that produced a final product, removing the need
for restrictive air-gapped environments. It tracks all dependencies to
their source code through fixed-output derivations and exports these
sources, typically a few GB, to an offline system for integrity proof
by rebuilding everything from scratch. This method lets developers use
modern tools and workflows while ensuring the cryptographic supply
chain verification needed by agencies like CISA, BSI, and ANSSI for
critical systems. 

 DANABOT TAKEDOWN SHOWS HOW AGENTIC AI CUT MONTHS OF SOC ANALYSIS TO
WEEKS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 U.S. authorities have dismantled DanaBot, a Russian malware operation
that infected 300,000+ systems and caused $50+ million in damage. The
takedown showcased agentic AI's cybersecurity capabilities. Autonomous
threat detection and real-time analysis were used to accelerate
investigations and enable swift law enforcement action against
sophisticated cyber threats. 

 WIRELESS PIVOTS: HOW TRUSTED NETWORKS BECOME INVISIBLE THREAT VECTORS
(9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Even well-configured enterprise Wi-Fi networks that use EAP-TLS can
be compromised via wireless pivots targeting trusted devices
connecting to untrusted networks outside the corporate perimeter.
Attackers capture probe requests from corporate devices, set up rogue
access points mimicking home networks (like Thomson routers), crack
Wi-Fi passwords via WPA handshake captures, and use tools like
Responder to intercept NetNTLM hashes from mDNS/LLMNR broadcasts. Once
cracked, these hashes provide internal credentials for accessing cloud
services like Office 365, illustrating that the security boundary
extends beyond the corporate network to any location where trusted
devices connect.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SPECIALIZED CYBER TRAINING FOR ICS/OT (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Industrial environments‚Äîsuch as critical infrastructure and
manufacturing‚Äîface unique threats that IT security training doesn't
address. Watch the video [11] to see why specific ICS/OT training is a
must. Ready to start? SANS offers hands-on labs with real equipment
and instructors who are active in the field today. See available
courses and certifications [12] 

 ENVILDER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Envilder is a CLI that securely centralizes your environment
variables from AWS SSM as a single source of truth. 

 PROMPTME (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 PromptMe is an educational project that showcases security
vulnerabilities in large language models and their web integrations.
It includes 10 hands-on challenges inspired by the OWASP LLM Top 10,
demonstrating how these vulnerabilities can be discovered and
exploited in real-world scenarios. 

 UNBOUND (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Unbound's AI Gateway product connects to commonly used AI tools to
surface usage patterns and provide model routing, real-time
protection, and usage analytics.

MISCELLANEOUS

 POLICE TAKES DOWN AVCHECK SITE USED BY CYBERCRIMINALS TO SCAN MALWARE
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 International law enforcement seized AVCheck, one of the largest
counter-antivirus services cybercriminals used to test whether their
malware could evade commercial antivirus software before deployment.
The operation, which involved U.S., Dutch, and other agencies, also
took down related crypting services Cryptor.biz and Crypt.guru that
helped obfuscate malware to make it undetectable. The takedown was
part of Operation Endgame and disrupted a key component of the
cybercriminal ecosystem that allowed ransomware groups to refine their
attacks against security systems. 

 RANSOMWARE KINGPIN ‚ÄúSTERN‚Äù APPARENTLY IDED BY GERMAN LAW
ENFORCEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 German police have identified "Stern," the enigmatic leader of the
notorious Trickbot cybercrime cartel, as 36-year-old Russian Vitaly
Kovalev. Trickbot attacked thousands of victims, including hospitals,
stealing hundreds of millions over six years. Kovalev was previously
sanctioned under different aliases, but his connection to "Stern"
remained hidden until now.

 BILLIONS OF COOKIES UP FOR GRABS AS EXPERTS WARN OVER SESSION
SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 93.7 billion stolen cookies are for sale online, with 7-9% still
active and exploitable by cybercriminals for account access. 

 VICTORIA'S SECRET HIT BY OUTAGES AS IT BATTLES SECURITY INCIDENT (2
MINUTE READ) [20]
