 AI IS BREAKING IAM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI-powered deepfakes and phishing attacks enable bad actors to
impersonate employees with terrifying precision. To keep up, security
teams need a viable Know Your Employee (KYE) strategy [4] with higher
assurance authentication policies.

Join Persona's engineering team for a live discussion and demo [4]
covering:

 	* How top teams combat phishing, social engineering, and
identity-based risk.
 	* Automating identity verification [4] across your global workforce
with Persona's KYE solution.
 	* Combining KYE with IAM tools like Okta and Cisco Duo to elevate
your Zero Trust strategy.
 	* Best practices for deploying KYE efficiently — and without
disrupting your systems.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 16 BILLION APPLE, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, AND OTHER PASSWORDS LEAKED (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A record 16 billion login credentials have leaked online, exposing
passwords from major services. Experts urge users to stop reusing
passwords, adopt password managers, enable multi-factor
authentication, and switch to passkeys for better security. The leak
is not from a single breach but multiple infostealer sources. 

 ATTACK ON OXFORD CITY COUNCIL EXPOSES 21 YEARS OF ELECTION WORKER
DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Oxford City Council suffered a cyberattack on June 7-8, compromising
21 years of election worker data (2001-2022). The breach affected
current and former council officers' personal information. Automated
security systems detected and stopped the attack and have since been
restored. There is no evidence that suggests data was shared
externally or mass-downloaded. 

 ANUBIS RANSOMWARE LISTS DISNEYLAND PARIS AS NEW VICTIM (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Anubis ransomware group asserts that it has acquired 64GB of data
from Disneyland Paris, mostly concerning construction and renovation
efforts. They claim to have accessed the files by breaching a partner
company and have shared images and videos as evidence. It remains
uncertain whether customer data was also compromised. Disneyland Paris
has not verified the breach.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLOUDTRAIL LOGGING EVASION: WHERE POLICY SIZE MATTERS (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Researchers from Permiso Security discovered a novel CloudTrail log
bypass that abuses differing policy size calculations. AWS'
documentation states that whitespace does not count when determining
the maximum size of an IAM policy. However, the researchers determined
that the policy would fail validation if the whitespace caused the
size to exceed 131,072 characters. The researchers discovered that
CloudTrail fails to capture full request details for requests in the
size range of 102,401 to 131,072. 

 DO NOT RUN ANY CARGO COMMANDS ON UNTRUSTED PROJECTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This post highlights two attack vectors by which malicious Rust code
could target the cargo system. The first attack vector abuses the fact
that a project could remap the `rustc` binary to any arbitrary path,
which would compromise any cargo commands. The second attack vector
could compromise plugins that don't use the cargo config files, such
as `cargo crev`, by defining an alias for that command in the
config.toml. 

 DETECTION PITFALLS YOU MIGHT BE SLEEPING ON (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post presents five common Windows detection pitfalls that can
lead to gaps in detection. The pitfalls include parameters being able
to be called in multiple different ways, & and | causing multiple log
entries for a single command, extra whitespace in commands, other
forms of command obfuscation, and commands that don't cause process
creation events. Each pitfall also includes detection tips to
circumvent it.
