 THE COMPLIANCE LEADER'S GUIDE TO CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most compliance mandates require you to define your risk tolerance
before putting controls in place. To do so, you first need to have a
good understanding of cybersecurity risk, and how it impacts your
compliance posture.

üìò¬†Drata's Guide to Cybersecurity Risk Management [4] covers:

 	* An overview of IT and cybersecurity risk management.
 	* Applying risk management to compliance and regulations.
 	* An intro to frameworks such as NIST and COBIT.
 	* How to create repeatable processes to define, review, and mitigate
IT risks.
 	* Effectively setting and monitoring controls.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TEMU DENIES BREACH AFTER HACKER CLAIMS THEFT OF 87 MILLION DATA
RECORDS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Temu denied being hacked or having a data breach after a threat actor
claimed to have stolen 87 million customer records. It says the stolen
data does not match the company's own data. Users should take
precautionary steps like enabling two-factor authentication and
changing passwords. 

 VMWARE VCENTER SERVER VULNERABILITIES LET ATTACKERS EXECUTE REMOTE
CODE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Two critical vulnerabilities in VMware vCenter Server and Cloud
Foundation products allow attackers to execute remote code and
escalate privileges. VMware has advised customers to patch affected
systems immediately by upgrading to specific versions or applying the
async patch. These flaws impact versions 7.0 and 8.0 of vCenter Server
and versions 4.x and 5.x of Cloud Foundation. 

 THE MAIDS INTERNATIONAL NOTIFIES CONSUMERS OF THE JANUARY 2024 DATA
BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Maids International experienced a data breach that exposed
sensitive consumer information like Social Security numbers and health
data. It took steps to investigate and notify affected individuals.
Consider seeking help to protect yourself from potential fraud or
identity theft.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CONFUSION ATTACKS: EXPLOITING HIDDEN AMBIGUITY IN APACHE HTTP SERVER
(12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apache's HTTP server's modular design opens it up to vulnerabilities
as the request_rec structure gets passed around to different modules,
which may mutate it and interfere with how a module further downstream
expects it to be, leading to confusion attacks. Most modules treat the
filename parameter as a system path but some treat it as a URL. This
leads to path truncation vulnerabilities in mod_rewrite and ACL bypass
in mod_proxy. mod_rewrite will always load the path from both the
DocumentRoot and root directory, which can lead to source code
disclosure or LFI, XSS, and even RCE via local gadget abuse and
jailbreak. A legacy code snippet that allows for the Content-Type to
override the Handler causes handler confusion, which can lead to SSRF,
information disclosure, and RCE. 

 ENHANCING LINKEDIN'S SECURITY POSTURE MANAGEMENT WITH AI-DRIVEN
INSIGHTS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LinkedIn developed a tool called Security Posture Platform (SPP),
which provides a graph database and GraphQL API to answer questions
about security posture in the organization. To enhance usability by
allowing for natural language querying, LinkedIn added an AI layer to
SPP. This post describes the process and data engineering used to
achieve 85-90% accuracy with LinkedIn's AI. 

 EXPLORING DESERIALIZATION ATTACKS AND THEIR EFFECTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This blog post explores deserialization attacks, focusing on how to
identify and exploit vulnerabilities in applications that handle
serialized data. It provides a step-by-step guide on how attackers can
inject malicious code through deserialization, ultimately gaining
control over the application's functionality. The author emphasizes
the importance of understanding these attacks to enhance security
practices during code review engagements.

 FIBRATUS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Fibratus detects, protects, and eradicates advanced adversary
tradecraft by scrutinizing and asserting a wide spectrum of system
events against a behavior-driven rule engine and YARA memory scanner.
Events can be shipped to a wide array of output sinks or dumped to
capture files for local inspection and forensics analysis. Users can
use filaments to extend Fibratus with their own arsenal of tools and
so leverage the power of the Python ecosystem. 

 OPAL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 OPAL is an administration layer for Policy Engines, such as Open
Policy Agent (OPA) and AWS' Cedar Agent. It detects changes to both
policy and policy data in real time and pushes live updates to agents.
OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed for live applications.

 REDEFINING CNAPP: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO THE FUTURE OF CLOUD SECURITY
(15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post provides a comprehensive look at the cloud security and
CNAPP landscape. It begins with a history of cloud security before
diving into the agent vs agentless debate. Agent based scammers can
provide more granular insights and provide runtime protection but can
be difficult to deploy and may have performance issues. Agentless
scanners are quick to deploy but generate a lot of false positives and
are not suited to containerized workloads. CNAPP stifles innovation
while being too bloated to be useful due to trying to cater to cloud
security engineers and developers, who are both looking for
fundamentally different things. The future of CNAPP is a convergence
between vulnerability management, posture scanning, runtime detection,
and response. 

 MICROSOFT IS BUILDING NEW WINDOWS SECURITY FEATURES TO PREVENT
ANOTHER CROWDSTRIKE INCIDENT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In the wake of the disastrous CrowdStrike outage, Microsoft met with
industry leaders to discuss security features that could be added to
Windows to enable endpoint security vendors to move their products out
of the kernel. Many vendors championed this as a productive endeavor
and appreciated the collaboration from Microsoft. Others, like
Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, cautioned the move as potentially
leading to an unfair market where only Microsoft has access to the
kernel. Microsoft has not mentioned locking vendors out of the kernel
since 2006.
