 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Phishing has gone beyond email. Today's attackers use AI-generated
voices, videos, and interactive deepfakes of company executives. They
can fool anyone - including you and your coworkers.

Backed by $55M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z, Adaptive Security is
the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered social
engineering [4]. Adaptive keeps employees on their feet with tools
such as:

 	* Deepfake phishing simulations of company executives in real-life
scenarios
 	* Interactive, customizable training content tailored for each
employee
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that factors in your publicly available
data adversaries can exploit

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BOMBSHELL: THE SIGNED BACKDOOR HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT ON FRAMEWORK
DEVICES (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Eclypsium researchers discovered that Microsoft-signed UEFI shells on
approximately 200,000 Framework laptops contain dangerous "mm" (memory
modify) commands that can completely bypass Secure Boot protections by
overwriting security handler pointers in memory. The attack leverages
the implicit trust model, where signed components are automatically
trusted, allowing attackers to disable signature verification and load
arbitrary malicious code while the system still reports Secure Boot as
enabled. Security professionals should prioritize updating UEFI
revocation lists (DBX), implementing BIOS passwords, and conducting
firmware vulnerability assessments, as commercial cheat providers are
already exploiting this technique and could be weaponized by
nation-state actors for pre-OS persistence. 

 CYBER GIANT F5 NETWORKS SAYS GOVERNMENT HACKERS HAD 'LONG-TERM'
ACCESS TO ITS SYSTEMS, STOLE CODE AND CUSTOMER DATA (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 F5 Networks revealed that government-backed hackers accessed its
systems for an extended period, stealing source code and customer
data. The intrusion impacted key product development areas and exposed
sensitive customer configurations. While F5 acted to contain the
breach and released security patches, over 1,000 companies, including
many Fortune 500 firms, may be at risk. 

 CHINESE HACKERS LEVERAGE GEO-MAPPING TOOL TO MAINTAIN YEAR-LONG
PERSISTENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Reliaquest researchers uncovered a Chinese hacking campaign that
targeted critical infrastructure across Asia and North America. The
attackers used spear phishing to access the networks, then downloaded
geo-mapping malware that disguised itself as a software component. The
malware masked its network traffic to blend in with routine traffic
and managed to avoid detection for at least 12 months.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LLM HONEYPOT VS. CRYPTOJACKING: UNDERSTANDING THE ENEMY (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Mario Candela used Beelzebub's LLM network honeypot to detect
cryptojacking malware that collected system data, then stopped other
miners and started XMR mining via c3pool. The operation earned around
$4,126 from 20 XMR across 95 servers. Attackers used
'validator/qwerty' credentials for initial access, then changed root
passwords and established persistence. Security experts should note
the value of LLM honeypots for behavioral analysis and coordinated
disruption, as the author neutralized the threat by reporting the
wallet to c3pool, which removed all infected miners. 

 BLIND ENUMERATION OF GRPC SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Adversis developed grpc-scan to automate service discovery on gRPC
endpoints when reflection is disabled and documentation is minimal,
exploiting how different gRPC implementations return distinct error
codes (UNIMPLEMENTED vs NOT_FOUND) to differentiate between
non-existent services and valid services with invalid methods. The
tool systematically tests thousands of service/method combinations
using common naming patterns and leverages HTTP/2 multiplexing for
efficient scanning, revealing common security anti-patterns like
legacy services with weaker authentication, method proliferation where
newer methods bypass security checks, and "internal" services exposed
on public endpoints. Security professionals should recognize that
gRPC's opacity often creates a false sense of security through
obscurity, and should implement proper service inventory management,
consistent authentication across all service versions, and network
segmentation rather than relying on undocumented APIs for protection. 

 UNLOCKING LLM JAILBREAKS: DECONSTRUCTING PLINY'S PROMPT AND ADVANCED
EVASION TECHNIQUES (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Pliny the Liberator is a well-known LLM jailbreaker who shares their
jailbreaking prompts on GitHub. Pliny's prompts make use of several
techniques to effectively jailbreak LLMs, such as instruction
prioritization, obfuscation and redirection, guardrail negation,
cognitive overload, contextual misdirection, task tunneling, tonal
misdirection, and output quantity bias. This post steps through each
technique and showcases how the prompt utilizes it.

 STREAMLINING VULNERABILITY RESEARCH WITH THE IDALIB RUST BINDINGS FOR
IDA 9.2 (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post presents three Rust-based IDA Pro 9.2 plugins that leverage
Binarly's idalib bindings for automated vulnerability research.
rhabdomancer identifies potentially insecure API function calls with
severity tiers, haruspex extracts decompiled pseudocode for static
analysis tools like Semgrep, and augur organizes string-related code
for analysis. The tactical approach focuses on scale and automation,
with these headless tools achieving blazing-fast analysis (processing
350KB binaries in under 3 seconds) while integrating with existing
vulnerability research workflows through IDE compatibility and static
analysis tool chains. Security researchers should adopt this
methodology of combining reverse engineering automation with static
analysis pipelines.

 5CA DENIES THIRD-PARTY ZENDESK PLATFORM WAS CAUSE OF DISCORD BREACH
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Third-party provider 5CA has publicly denied responsibility for the
Discord breach that exposed 5.5 million users' data, including over
70,000 government IDs, contradicting Discord's initial claims that
blamed 5CA's Zendesk systems. The breach was carried out by Scattered
LAPSUS$ Hunters who gained 58 hours of access starting September 20,
stealing 1.6TB of data, including support tickets and partial payment
information for 580,000 users. Security professionals should note the
discrepancy between the hacker group's claim of 521,000
age-verification tickets versus Discord's reported 70,000 exposed
government IDs, highlighting the importance of independent breach
assessments and avoiding premature attribution in incident response. 

 ANATOMY OF AN ATTACK: THE "BLACKSUIT BLITZ" AT A GLOBAL EQUIPMENT
MANUFACTURER (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Unit 42 assisted a manufacturer targeted by Ignoble Scorpius
(BlackSuit ransomware) after attackers used voice phishing to steal
VPN credentials, then executed DCSync attacks to compromise domain
controllers and exfiltrate 400GB of data before deploying ransomware
across 60 VMware ESXi hosts. The incident response strategy involved
rapidly expanding Cortex XDR visibility from 250 to 17,000 endpoints
and using automated containment through Cortex XSOAR to stop lateral
movement, while implementing critical defenses including MFA
enforcement, network segmentation, and EFSRPC blocking. Security
professionals should prioritize proactive multi-layered defenses,
including robust endpoint visibility, automated response capabilities,
and strict access controls, as this case demonstrates how a single
compromised credential can escalate to a $20 million ransom demand
without proper preventive measures. 

 DISMANTLING A CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN RISK IN VSCODE EXTENSION
MARKETPLACES (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Over 550 sensitive secrets, including AWS and GitHub tokens, were
exposed in public VSCode extensions. This was primarily due to
insecure file handling, which attackers could exploit to push
malicious updates and launch supply chain attacks. In response,
platforms revoked compromised tokens, notified publishers, and
improved scanning.
