ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 1.6 MILLION PEOPLE IMPACTED BY DATA BREACH AT LABORATORY SERVICES
COOPERATIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Laboratory Services Cooperative (LSC) suffered a data breach in
October that affected 1.6 million individuals. The cyberattack exposed
sensitive personal information, including names, contact details,
Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and medical
records. Some Planned Parenthood patients were impacted. 

 NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND OF MOROCCO SUFFERS DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A threat actor, 'Jabaroot,' claims to have breached Morocco's
National Social Security Fund (CNSS), compromising the data of nearly
2 million citizens. The leak includes personal and financial details
like passports, emails, and banking information, posing significant
identity theft and fraud risks for those affected. 

 FORTINET: SYMLINK TRICK GIVES ACCESS TO PATCHED FORTIGATE VPN DEVICES
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fortinet warns that threat actors can maintain access to FortiGate
VPN devices after patching by creating symbolic links to the root file
system via SSL-VPN, allowing read-only access. Users should upgrade to
the latest FortiOS version to eliminate malicious files and check
configurations for unauthorized changes.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UNCOVERING A 0-CLICK RCE IN THE SUPERNOTE NOMAD E-INK TABLET (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There was a remote code execution vulnerability in the SuperNote A6
X2 Nomad tablet that let attackers on the same network compromise the
device without user interaction. The exploit involved identifying an
open port with a custom HTTP server, discovering a path traversal flaw
for arbitrary file placement, and uploading a malicious firmware
update to the EXPORT directory, which auto-installs using publicly
available debug keys. The exploit was responsibly disclosed to Ratta
Software in July - the company acknowledged it and made plans to fix
it in its December 2024 update, but a patch has yet to appear. 

 TROX STEALER: A DEEP DIVE INTO A NEW MALWARE AS A SERVICE (MAAS)
ATTACK CAMPAIGN (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 TROX Stealer, a Malware-as-a-Service first identified in December
2024, uses urgent debt collection phishing emails to entice victims
into downloading malicious executables. It features a multi-stage
execution chain with Python, Node.js, and WebAssembly to evade
detection, stealing sensitive data like credit cards, browser
credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and Discord/Telegram session
files. The attackers have a structured infrastructure, with domains
registered nine months prior to the attack, indicating careful
planning and marketing on hacking forums. 

 STATIC ANALYSIS VIA LIFTED PHP (ZEND) BYTECODE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Eptalights Research analyzes PHP code at the bytecode level,
providing a reliable method for understanding execution. Its
technology converts Zend bytecode into a Pythonic model, simplifying
the analysis of obfuscated PHP code that is hard to interpret at the
source level. This is especially useful for obfuscated code with goto
statements or encoded files using loaders, granting access to control
flow, variables, and call sites even when the source is obscured.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SPEKTION (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Spektion provides vulnerability analysis for an organization's entire
software inventory, leveraging runtime behavior analysis to provide
detailed information on real risks and enable customers to prioritize
and mitigate flaws, even those without CVEs or patches. 

 CABLE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 .NET post-exploitation toolkit for Active Directory reconnaissance
and exploitation. 

 JXSCOUT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 jxscout serves as a resource for security researchers looking to
examine JavaScript code for vulnerabilities. It works seamlessly with
proxies such as Burp or Caido to capture and arrange static assets,
pre-fetch code segments, automatically beautify JS, and reverse source
maps when the .map files are accessible.

 LLMS CAN'T STOP MAKING UP SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES AND SABOTAGING
EVERYTHING (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI coding assistants often hallucinate non-existent software
packages, creating a security vulnerability called "slopsquatting."
Attackers exploit this by creating malicious packages using these
hallucinated names, so it is recommended for developers to
double-check the package they are installing is the correct one. 

 10 BUGS FOUND IN PERPLEXITY AI'S CHATBOT ANDROID APP (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Researchers have found ten critical security flaws in Perplexity AI's
Android app, including hardcoded API keys, network vulnerabilities,
and weak authentication. These issues could allow attackers to bypass
security measures and access user data. Experts recommend that Android
users immediately uninstall the app until these easily exploitable
vulnerabilities are fixed. 

 A NEXT-GENERATION CERTIFICATE TRANSPARENCY LOG BUILT ON CLOUDFLARE
WORKERS (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The new static CT API log design simplifies operations and improves
integrity for Certificate Transparency systems, serving log data
efficiently to reduce costs and enhance availability. Cloudflare's
Azul implementation on Workers further streamlines the process for CT
log operators.
