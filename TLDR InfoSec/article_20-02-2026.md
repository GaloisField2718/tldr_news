 MANUAL GRC DOESN'T SCALE -- MOVE TO AGENTIC TRUST MANAGEMENT WITH
DRATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Compliance doesn't end when you get your SOC 2 certificate. Security
reviews, audits, and vendor questionnaires demand constant attention
-- and leave GRC teams too overwhelmed to actually think about
security strategy.

Drata's Agentic Trust Management Platform [4] automates the most
time-consuming tasks, from security questionnaires to continuous
evidence collection, saving teams hundreds of hours [4] each year.
Drata's AI chases down documents, so you can focus on outcomes.

With Drata's built-in Trust Center, you can streamline security
reviews, share your security posture, and build trust faster
throughout the deal process.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE: JAVA DESERIALIZATION THROUGH BROKEN CRYPTO IN
OPENTEXT DIRECTORY SERVICES (12 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Searchlight Cyber (Assetnote) discovered an unauthenticated Java
deserialization vulnerability in OpenText Directory Services (OTDS)
exploitable in its default configuration, stemming from a flawed HMAC
signature verification where attacker-controlled length fields allowed
truncating the signed message to begin at an injected payload.
Exploitation required building a custom Deflate compressor with
tailored Huffman codes to produce output restricted to valid modified
UTF-8 bytes (0x01-0x7F) while remaining incompressible by zlib,
enabling the payload to survive a double-compression pipeline intact.
Organizations running OTDS should patch immediately, as a compromise
could affect all integrated OpenText applications that rely on it for
authentication. 

 FRENCH GOVERNMENT SAYS 1.2 MILLION BANK ACCOUNTS EXPOSED IN BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 France's Ministry of Economy disclosed that attackers used stolen
official credentials to access FICOBA, the national bank account
registry, exposing data on 1.2 million accounts, including IBANs,
names, addresses, and some tax IDs. Operational banking access and
balances were not exposed, but authorities warn of heightened phishing
and scams. 

 CRITICAL INFRA HONEYWELL CCTVS VULNERABLE TO AUTH BYPASS FLAW (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CISA warned of CVE-2026-1670 (CVSS 9.8), a missing authentication
flaw in multiple Honeywell CCTV models that allows unauthenticated
attackers to remotely change the password recovery email address,
enabling full account takeover and unauthorized access to camera
feeds. Affected models include the I-HIB2PI-UL and several SMB
NDAA-compliant PTZ cameras deployed in commercial and critical
infrastructure environments. Organizations should isolate these
devices behind firewalls, restrict network exposure, and contact
Honeywell for patch guidance.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RED VULNS RISING: EXAMINING CHINESE NATIONAL VULNERABILITY DATABASES
(18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bitsight analyzed China's two national vulnerability
databases—CNNVD, overseen by the Ministry of State Security, and
CNVD, operated by CNCERT—and found that while they largely mirror
CVE publication, approximately 1,400 entries were published in Chinese
databases before becoming public in CVE, often by several months.
China's 2021 RMSV regulations tightened domestic vulnerability
disclosure controls, including mandatory 48-hour reporting to the
government and prohibitions on sharing PoC exploits. There was a
notable decline in non-CVE vulnerability publications from CNVD after
the regulation, although CNNVD has recently seen a resurgence.
Security leaders should account for potential blind spots in Western
vulnerability ecosystems, as some Chinese database entries lack CVE
equivalents and may represent vulnerabilities unknown to Western
defenders. 

 CLINEJECTION — COMPROMISING CLINE'S PRODUCTION RELEASES JUST BY
PROMPTING AN ISSUE TRIAGER (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A prompt-injected GitHub issue title could drive Cline's Claude-based
triage bot to execute arbitrary commands in CI, then use GitHub
Actions cache poisoning to hijack nightly build workflows and steal VS
Code Marketplace, OpenVSX, and npm publishing tokens. This chain could
have enabled a massive supply-chain attack on millions of developers
via malicious extension or CLI updates. 

 DECRYPTING MULTIDESK PASSWORDS (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 MultiDesk RDP client's password encryption was reverse-engineered,
revealing RC4 encryption with per-user keys stored in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MultiDesk\key registry hive across both
legacy (v3.16) and modern (v14.0) versions. Version 3.16 used
base64-encoded RC4 ciphertext with rdtsc-generated keys, while version
5+ introduced a salted key derivation scheme using CryptGenRandom, but
remained fundamentally RC4-based. Pentesters should add MultiDesk.xml,
MultiDesk.multidesk, and the associated registry keys to their
internal recon checklists, as credential recovery is trivial with
local admin or user-level access to the target machine.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE MIMIKATZ MISSING MANUAL (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Carlos Perez (DarkOperator) has publicly released "The Mimikatz
Missing Manual," a comprehensive guide originally developed as private
training material with direct input from Mimikatz author Benjamin
Delpy, covering Windows identity, Kerberos, and PKI research. The
manual spans seven parts, including LSASS credential extraction,
Kerberos ticket forgery, DCSync/DCShadow persistence, and DPAPI abuse,
with guidance tailored for red teams, blue teams, and security
researchers. Available as a GitHub Pages site, it emphasizes not just
command references, but the underlying Windows Security Authority
internals being manipulated. 

 VENICE SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Venice Security provides an adaptive privileged access management
platform that discovers identities and entitlements across cloud,
on‑prem, and SaaS, grants just‑in‑time access only when needed,
and automatically revokes standing privileges to reduce enterprise
risk. 

 DATA-SHIELD IPV4 BLOCKLIST (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Data-Shield IPv4 Blocklist Community provides an official,
curated registry of IPv4 addresses identified as malicious. Updated
continuously, this resource offers vital threat intelligence to
bolster your Firewall and WAF instances, delivering a robust,
additional layer of security for your infrastructure.

 CITIZEN LAB FINDS CELLEBRITE TOOL USED ON KENYAN ACTIVIST'S PHONE IN
POLICE CUSTODY (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Citizen Lab confirmed with high confidence that Cellebrite forensic
extraction tools were used on Kenyan pro-democracy activist Boniface
Mwangi's Samsung phone while in police custody following his July 2025
arrest, potentially enabling full data extraction including messages,
passwords, and financial information. The findings follow a similar
report of Cellebrite misuse in Jordan and coincide with Amnesty
International's discovery of Intellexa's Predator spyware targeting an
Angolan journalist via WhatsApp, marking the first confirmed Predator
case against civil society in Angola. The cases highlight the growing
global abuse of commercial surveillance tools against activists and
journalists, with Predator's sophisticated anti-forensics capabilities
including crash monitoring, recording indicator suppression, and
granular operator control over failed deployments. 

 INTERPOL OPERATION RED CARD 2.0 ARRESTS 651 IN AFRICAN CYBERCRIME
CRACKDOWN (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An INTERPOL-led push across 16 African countries led to 651 arrests,
$4.3 million recovered, and disruption of online scams causing over
$45 million in losses. Authorities dismantled high-yield investment,
mobile money, and fake loan schemes, seizing 2,341 devices and taking
down 1,442 malicious IPs and domains, with victims identified both in
Africa and abroad. 

 KEEPING GOOGLE PLAY & ANDROID APP ECOSYSTEMS SAFE IN 2025 (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Google reported blocking over 1.75 million policy-violating apps and
banning 80,000 malicious developer accounts from Google Play in 2025,
while Play Protect's real-time scanning identified more than 27
million new malicious apps from outside the store across 350 billion
daily scans. Enhanced fraud protection expanded to 185 markets
covering 2.8 billion devices, blocking 266 million risky sideloaded
installation attempts. New defenses included in-call scam protection
preventing users from being socially engineered into disabling Play
Protect, and Android 16's one-line-of-code tapjacking protection for
sensitive app screens.

collective ecosystem effort, warning that data harvesting threats from
nation-state adversaries like China will outlive leadership cycles and
require sustained cross-generational commitment toward the 2035
migration target.
