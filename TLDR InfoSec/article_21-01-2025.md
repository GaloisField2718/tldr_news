STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI-SUPPORTED SPEAR PHISHING FOOLS MORE THAN 50% OF TARGETS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A group of researchers tested spear-phishing emails that were created
by AI agents based on Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o which crawled the
Internet for information on the targets. The researchers achieved a
click-through rate (CTR) of 54% with the AI agents compared to 12% in
the control group. Human-crafted spear-phishing emails also achieved a
54% CTR but at 30x the cost of the AI-generated ones, whereas emails
crafted with AI and human input achieved a CTR of 56% with 4x the
cost. 

 PREVENTING UNINTENDED ENCRYPTION OF AMAZON S3 OBJECTS (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AWS detected unauthorized encryption activities in Amazon S3 due to

incidents by using short-term credentials, implementing data recovery
procedures, and monitoring access patterns. AWS notes that blocking of
use of SSE-C encryption can also enhance security against unauthorized
access. 

 INVESTIGATING AN "EVIL" RJ45 DONGLE (5 MINUTE READ) [9]

software-defined CD-ROM feature to install drivers. The device
contained a chip that emulated a CD-ROM to simplify driver
installation, dispelling concerns of potential malware. The
investigation highlighted the importance of research and patience in
understanding complex hardware systems.
