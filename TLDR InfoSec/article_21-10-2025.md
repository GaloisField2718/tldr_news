 WHAT COMES AFTER THE CORPORATE FIREWALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The corporate firewall is a relic of bygone times. With employees
working from coffee shops, airports, and home networks, traditional
perimeter security leaves your endpoints exposed to unmanaged devices
and compromised networks.

ThreatLocker Network Control [5] brings the firewall to each endpoint
with dynamic ACLs that automatically adjust based on location. Unlike
VPNs that route through central points, it creates direct, secure
endpoint-to-endpoint connections [5].

⚡ Create custom policies to open ports on demand for approved
devices and users.

⚡ Ports auto-close within 5 minutes when not in use.

⚡ Manage all endpoint firewalls from one console.

✅ No IT tickets needed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 131 CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT HIJACKING WHATSAPP WEB FOR MASSIVE SPAM
CAMPAIGN (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Socket researchers discovered 131 malicious Chrome extensions with
over 20,000 active users that inject code into WhatsApp Web to
automate bulk spam campaigns targeting Brazilian users. The
extensions, marketed as CRM tools with names like “YouSeller” and
“ZapVende,” share identical codebases and are distributed through
a franchise model operated by DBX Tecnologia, violating Google's
Chrome Web Store policies. The nine-month campaign aims to bypass
WhatsApp's rate limits and anti-spam controls by automating message
sending without user confirmation. 

 FOREIGN HACKERS BREACHED A US NUCLEAR WEAPONS PLANT VIA SHAREPOINT
FLAWS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Foreign threat actors breached the Kansas City National Security
Campus, which produces 80% of non-nuclear components for US nuclear
weapons, by exploiting unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities
CVE-2025-53770 (spoofing) and CVE-2025-49704 (RCE) in July, with
attribution disputed between Chinese nation-state groups (Linen
Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603) and Russian cybercriminals.
While the breach targeted IT systems rather than air-gapped
OT/manufacturing environments, experts warn that even unclassified
technical data such as precision requirements, tolerances, and supply
chain details could provide adversaries with strategic intelligence
about US weapons capabilities and manufacturing processes. Security
teams should prioritize patching SharePoint on-premises servers,
implement a comprehensive zero-trust architecture across both IT and
OT environments as outlined in DoD's emerging OT fan chart framework,
establish robust IT/OT segmentation to prevent lateral movement, and
recognize that nation-state actors may acquire zero-day knowledge
through MAPP program misuse or underground exchanges before patches
are available. 

 EMAIL BOMBS EXPLOIT LAX AUTHENTICATION IN ZENDESK (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Cybercriminals are abusing a lack of authentication in the customer
service platform Zendesk to flood victims' emails with spam messages
that come from hundreds of Zendesk customers. Zendesk customers who do
not require verified emails to submit tickets can be abused by
spammers to send unwanted emails from the company's domain. Zendesk
responded to this campaign by stating that customers are recommended
to require verification.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURING AMAZON BEDROCK API KEYS: BEST PRACTICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
AND MANAGEMENT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS recommends using temporary STS credentials over API keys when
possible, but when API keys are necessary, short-term keys with
built-in expiration are preferred over long-term keys. Organizations
should implement comprehensive monitoring through CloudTrail events,
EventBridge rules, and AWS Config to detect API key creation and usage
while using SCPs to control or block key creation entirely if not
needed. The article provides detailed guidance on identifying,
protecting, detecting, and responding to API key security events
across the credential lifecycle. 

 HOW A FAKE AI RECRUITER DELIVERS FIVE STAGED MALWARE DISGUISED AS A
DREAM JOB (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A sophisticated phishing scheme targets developers by posing as an AI
recruiter offering an enticing job. Victims are tricked into cloning
and running a malicious code repository as part of a “technical
assessment,” which then unfolds the attack over five stages: first,
a hidden backdoor is silently activated, followed by advanced
JavaScript and Python malware that steals credentials, crypto wallets,
and browser data, monitors keystrokes and clipboard, and installs
remote-access tools like AnyDesk. The malware uses deep obfuscation
and persistence mechanisms to resist removal and detection, ultimately
handing attackers full control and ongoing surveillance of the
compromised system. 

 HOW I REVERSED AMAZON'S KINDLE WEB OBFUSCATION BECAUSE THEIR APP
SUCKED (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Frustrated by Amazon's Kindle app instability and restrictive DRM,
this author set out to reverse-engineer Amazon's web obfuscation
system. Instead of granting simple access to purchased ebooks, Amazon
uses a system where the actual text is encoded as glyph IDs rather
than characters, with the mapping randomized for every batch of pages.
Overcoming these sophisticated protections required pixel-level glyph
matching and leveraging font metrics to reconstruct the book,
eventually allowing the owner to access their purchase in a way they
controlled.

 NANOCHAT LETS YOU BUILD YOUR OWN HACKABLE LLM (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Andrej Karpathy's nanochat is an open-source project that enables the
creation of a simple ChatGPT clone for approximately $100 using 8,000
lines of minimal-dependency code and a single speedrun.sh script,
producing a 1.9 billion parameter model trained on 38 billion tokens
in about 4 hours on NVIDIA 8XH100 GPU hardware. The accessible
codebase allows security researchers and developers to experiment with
LLM architecture, understand model training processes, and test
modifications without commercial platform restrictions, with scaling
to $1,000 enabling significantly more capable models for math, coding,
and reasoning tasks. This transparent, hackable approach provides
security professionals with valuable insight into LLM internals for
threat modeling, adversarial testing, and understanding AI system
vulnerabilities that commercial black-box models obscure.

 WINOS 4.0 HACKERS EXPAND TO JAPAN AND MALAYSIA WITH NEW MALWARE (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Winos 4.0 threat actors have expanded operations from China and
Taiwan to Japan and Malaysia, deploying HoldingHands RAT through
phishing emails with fake Finance Ministry PDFs containing embedded
malicious links hosted primarily on Tencent Cloud infrastructure. The
sophisticated multi-stage attack chain uses digitally signed
executables, anti-VM checks, targets Norton/Avast/Kaspersky for
evasion, leverages Windows Task Scheduler for persistence, and injects
payloads into taskhostw.exe with process monitoring for re-injection,
while newer variants added C2 IP update capabilities via registry
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\HHClient). Security teams should monitor
for suspicious PDF attachments impersonating government finance
documents, block identified C2 infrastructure, including IP
156.251.17[.]9 and domain twczb[.]com, implement behavioral detection
for Task Scheduler manipulation and unusual
dokan2.dll/TimeBrokerClient.dll activity in System32, and trace
Tencent Cloud APPID patterns to identify related phishing
infrastructure. 

 RUSSIAN LYNK GROUP LEAKS SENSITIVE UK MOD FILES, INCLUDING INFO ON
EIGHT MILITARY BASES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Russian cybercrime group Lynx breached Dodd Group, a UK Ministry of
Defence contractor, on September 23, stealing approximately 4TB of
data, including sensitive files on eight RAF and Royal Navy bases such
as RAF Lakenheath (hosting US F-35 jets and believed nuclear weapons
storage), RAF Portreath (NATO radar site), and RAF Predannack (UK
Drone Hub). The leaked data includes roughly 1,000 documents
containing staff names, emails, phone numbers, vehicle details,
visitor logs, security guidance, and construction records marked as
“Controlled” or “Official Sensitive,” with the gang publishing
data after failed ransom negotiations. Security professionals should
prioritize third-party risk management and contractor security
assessments, as supply chain compromises continue to expose critical
defense infrastructure and personnel data that nation-state actors can
leverage for intelligence gathering or future attacks.
