ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SYSTEMBC MALWARE TURNS INFECTED VPS SYSTEMS INTO PROXY HIGHWAY (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SystemBC is a proxy botnet providing a highway for malicious traffic,
with an average of 1,500 bots/day. It primarily recruits bots by
compromising VPS systems with at least one vulnerability, making up
over 80% of the bots. Some customers of SystemBC include REM Proxy, a
Russian web-scraping service, and a Vietnamese-based proxy network. 

 NEARLY 250,000 IMPACTED BY DATA BREACH AT MEDICAL ASSOCIATES OF
BREVARD (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Medical Associates of Brevard in Florida revealed that a data breach
in January affected almost 247,000 patients and exposed sensitive
health and personal data. The BianLian ransomware group claimed
responsibility for stealing information like emails and HR documents,
but it remains unclear how the stolen data has been used. 

 INSIGHT PARTNERS: RANSOMWARE HIT EXPOSED DATA ON 12K PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Venture firm Insight Partners suffered a ransomware attack that
exposed data of over 12,000 staff and investors. The breach began in
October 2024, leading to data encryption in January before being
detected. The stolen data includes personal, banking, and tax details.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DETECT SECRETS IN GITLAB CI LOGS USING GGSHIELD AND BRING YOUR OWN
SOURCE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GitGuardian demonstrates how to automatically scan GitLab CI/CD
pipeline logs for secrets using ggshield and their Bring Your Own
Source initiative, addressing a critical but often overlooked attack
vector where sensitive data like environment variables, API responses,
and temporary credentials are exposed in build logs. The solution
involves creating a custom Docker image with enhanced ggshield
capabilities, configuring secure token storage via HashiCorp Vault,
and implementing an automated scanning script that processes all
pipeline job logs and creates incidents in the GitGuardian dashboard.
This approach provides comprehensive secrets detection across the
entire DevOps lifecycle, catching runtime secrets that traditional
source code scanning misses while maintaining zero friction for
developers. 

 AWS AGENTCORE: THE OVERLOOKED PRIVILEGE ESCALATION PATH IN BEDROCK'S
AI TOOLING (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS Bedrock AgentCore is a collection of tools that assist in
deploying and scaling AI agents. AgentCore provides the ability to
launch Code Interpreters, which run code in a sandboxed environment
and can be customized to have access to AWS credentials to perform
actions on AWS resources. Custom Code Interpreters cannot be protected
with resource policies and only emit CloudTrail data events,
presenting a tempting privilege escalation vector for attackers. 

 LATERAL MOVEMENT - BITLOCKER (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature for Windows that protects
data at rest by encrypting full volumes. This post outlines a
privilege escalation or lateral movement technique that uses Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) to hijack specific COM objects of
BitLocker using remote manipulation of BitLocker registry keys to
execute code under the user's context on a target host. The post also
discusses detection opportunities for this attack and Sigma and
Windows Defender for Endpoint queries to detect them.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS - BASED ON REAL-WORLD
THREAT INTELLIGENCE (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Most security awareness programs achieve dismal completion rates
because they use generic scenarios. Huntress Managed SAT [12] builds
training from real threat intelligence gathered across 3.7M+ protected
endpoints. The result is 98% completion rates and employees who
recognize actual threats, not just textbook examples. Get a free trial

 YASA (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 YASA (Yet Another Static Analyzer) is an open-source static program
analysis project. Its core innovation lies in a unified intermediate
representation called the Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST),
designed to support multiple programming languages. Built on top of
UAST, YASA provides a highly accurate static analysis framework. Users
can extend its capabilities by writing custom checkers to perform
various program analysis tasks—such as AST queries, data flow
analysis, and function call graph analysis—and expose functionality
through SDK, declarative query language (QL), or MCP. 

 PYARMOR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Pyarmor is a command-line tool designed for obfuscating Python
scripts, binding obfuscated scripts to specific machines, and setting
expiration dates for obfuscated scripts. 

 INBOXFUSCATION (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Inboxfuscation is an advanced inbox rule obfuscation framework for
Microsoft Exchange environments. The tool provides sophisticated
Unicode-based obfuscation techniques to create stealthy inbox rules
that can evade basic detection while maintaining functionality.

 CHECK POINT ACQUIRES LAKERA TO BUILD A UNIFIED AI SECURITY STACK (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Check Point has announced plans to acquire AI security platform
Lakera in Q4 2025 to strengthen enterprise defenses against emerging
AI threats like prompt injection attacks, data leaks through LLMs, and
model manipulation as organizations rapidly adopt generative AI and
autonomous agents. Lakera's AI-native runtime protection technology
boasts 98% detection rates with sub-50ms latency and less than 0.5%
false positives, addressing gaps that traditional cybersecurity tools
cannot handle in real-time AI environments. 

 WATCHGUARD WARNS OF CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN FIREBOX FIREWALLS (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 WatchGuard has released security updates to address a critical (CVSS
9.3) remote code execution vulnerability impacting its Firebox
firewalls. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write on
devices configured to use IKEv2 VPN. Devices that have deleted the
vulnerable configuration but still have a branch office VPN to a
static gateway peer configured may also be vulnerable. 

 MEET SHADOWLEAK: ‘IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT' DATA THEFT USING AI (8
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Researchers at Radware discovered a vulnerability called ShadowLeak
that exploits OpenAI's ChatGPT through indirect prompt injection
attacks. Hidden email instructions can trick the AI into stealing
sensitive data like credit card numbers and names from users' inboxes.
The attack bypasses ChatGPT's security protections by encoding stolen
data in Base64 and exfiltrating it directly through OpenAI's servers
via the agent's browsing tool, making it nearly impossible to detect
since it doesn't go through the client interface. This attack
represents a significant escalation from previous client-side prompt
injection attacks, as the data theft occurs entirely on the backend
without any visible signs to the user.
