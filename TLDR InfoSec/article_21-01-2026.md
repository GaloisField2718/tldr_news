 THE DARK SIDE OF AI: 2.6MM UNDERGROUND MESSAGES ANALYZED (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Flashpoint just released a massive study of the AI threat landscape.
Analysts monitored over 2.6 MILLION AI-RELATED POSTS across Telegram,
the dark web, and underground LLM forums.

The findings are a wake-up call [4]. Threat actors are no longer just
"experimenting" — they are deploying:

 	* DEEPFAKE-AS-A-SERVICE for sophisticated social engineering.
 	* MULTILINGUAL PHISHING KITS that erase language barriers.
 	* FRAUD-GPTS: Custom LLMs fine-tuned specifically for malicious
activity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ACF PLUGIN BUG GIVES HACKERS ADMIN ON 50K WORDPRESS SITES (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Wordfence detected a new critical vulnerability in the Advanced
Custom Fields Extended (ACF Extended) plugin for WordPress that could
allow unauthenticated attackers to obtain admin privileges. The
vulnerability arises from a lack of enforcement of role restrictions
during form-based user creation. The vulnerability is only exploitable
on sites that use a “Create User” or “Update User” form with
the role field mapped. 

 MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES DATA BREACH IMPACTS 300K (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Minnesota Department of Human Services is notifying 300K victims
that their data was accessed by an unauthorized individual over the
course of a month. A user affiliated with a licensed care provider
accessed data in the MnCHOICES system without authorization. The data
accessed includes names, sex, dates of birth, phone numbers,
addresses, Medicaid ID numbers, and the last four digits of SSNs. 

 APACHE AIRFLOW VULNERABILITIES ENABLE SENSITIVE DATA EXPOSURE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two new vulnerabilities allow for sensitive data leakage in versions
of Apache Airflow prior to 3.16. The first vulnerability arises from
Airflow failing to properly mask proxy credentials in log files. The
second vulnerability arises from Airflow not applying user-registered
secret pattern masking before truncating field templates when dealing
with long fields in the Rendered Templates UI.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET SCAMMED (BY DPRK HACKERS) (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher documented a DPRK-linked Contagious Interview
campaign in which threat actors posed as recruiters on Discord,
delivering malware via fake technical assessments that deployed a
multi-stage payload using blockchain-based dead-drop resolvers across
Tron, Aptos, and Binance Smart Chain. The final RAT establishes
persistence by injecting into VS Code and Cursor IDEs, exfiltrates
credentials, and evades analysis by detecting cloud/CI/CD
environments. Detection requires monitoring for Node.js processes that
spawn with eval flags and API calls to blockchain endpoints such as
api.trongrid.io. 

 CLANG HARDENING CHEAT SHEET - TEN YEARS LATER (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Quarkslab has updated its Clang hardening cheat sheet after ten
years, documenting new compiler mitigations including FORTIFY_SOURCE
level 3, stack clash protection via -fstack-clash-protection, and
Intel CET/ARM PAC+BTI for control-flow integrity. The guide covers
defenses against ROP/JOP attacks through hardware-assisted mechanisms
such as shadow stacks and indirect branch tracking, as well as
speculative execution mitigations with -mspeculative-load-hardening.
Security teams should adopt the OpenSSF-recommended compiler flags and
consider architecture-specific protections (CET for x86 and PAC/BTI
for ARM) while balancing performance trade-offs. 

 SOLYXIMMORTAL: PYTHON MALWARE ANALYSIS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SolyxImmortal is a Python-based spyware that targets Windows systems,
focused on long-term surveillance and data theft rather than
destruction. It steals browser credentials, harvests documents, logs
keystrokes, and captures screenshots, then exfiltrates everything via
hardcoded Discord webhooks over HTTPS to blend into normal traffic. It
minimizes detection while continuously monitoring victims by
persisting through AppData and Run keys, abusing DPAPI to decrypt
Chromium credentials, and batching keystrokes and archives.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SECURITY LEADERS: BENCHMARK YOUR PASSWORD MATURITY IN UNDER 5 MINUTES
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 As cyberattackers grow bolder and data protection regulations become
stricter, organizational password management is a must. The Bitwarden
Password Management Maturity Model [11] is a free and simple framework
for evaluating your password posture. For more on how to protect your
org, take a look at the most trusted enterprise password manager [12] 

 ANAMNESIS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Anamnesis is an evaluation framework for studying how LLM agents
generate exploits from vulnerability reports, demonstrating that
Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 agents can independently develop working
exploits that bypass ASLR, NX, full RELRO, CFI, Shadow Stack, and
seccomp sandboxes when given a QuickJS use-after-free vulnerability
and proof-of-concept trigger. 

 SYZKALLER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Syzkaller is a kernel fuzzer that finds bugs across various operating
systems, including Linux and Windows. Originally for Linux, it now
supports other OS kernels. It is a coverage-guided tool developed by
Google, but it is not an official product. 

 ADTRAPPER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 ADTrapper is a comprehensive security analysis platform designed for
cybersecurity professionals to analyze Windows AD authentication logs.

MISCELLANEOUS

 UK GAMBLING REGULATOR ACCUSES META OF LYING ABOUT ITS STRUGGLE TO
SPOT ILLEGAL ADS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The UK Gambling Commission's executive director accused Meta of
knowingly allowing illegal gambling advertisements, noting that its
own searchable ad library reveals operators using keywords like "not
on Gamstop" to target vulnerable users. Meta suggested the regulator
deploy AI tools to find and report these ads rather than proactively
policing its own platform. The commission's executive director
described Meta's ad library as "a window into criminality" and said
the company appears "happy to turn a blind eye and continue taking
money from criminals." 

 NORTH KOREA-LINKED HACKERS TARGET DEVELOPERS VIA MALICIOUS VS CODE
PROJECTS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 North Korean operators are posing as recruiters and sending
developers fake coding tests that require cloning malicious Git
repositories into VS Code. Once the project is opened and trusted,
malicious tasks.json configurations fetch obfuscated JavaScript
payloads from Vercel to install backdoors such as BeaverTail and
InvisibleFerret, enabling remote code execution, keylogging, data
theft, and crypto mining. 

 WEAPONIZING CALENDAR INVITES: A SEMANTIC ATTACK ON GOOGLE GEMINI (8
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A seemingly normal calendar invite hides a natural-language payload
in the event description, which Gemini processes when a user later
asks about their schedule. This triggers Gemini to summarize private
meetings, write the summary into a new event visible to the attacker,
and reply with a harmless message.
