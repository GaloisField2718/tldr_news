 THE MSP PLAYBOOK FOR SELLING NETWORK PENTESTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're an MSP, you could seriously upgrade your value proposition
[4] by offering network pentesting to your customers.

Vonahi Security's playbook [4] will show you how to do it:

 	* Learn how to sell the value of pentesting to prospects that don't
have anything in place.
 	* Compete with (and beat) a prospect's current provider by offering
ongoing penetration testing at 50% of the cost of their current
provider.
 	* Templates for websites content, proof of value, and more.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW EVILMSGSPY ANDROID SPYWARE USED BY CHINESE POLICE (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Researchers from Lookout have discovered a spyware app developed by
Wuhan Chinasoft Token Information Technology Co., Ltd and used by
Chinese law enforcement. The spyware collects messages from chat apps,
screen recordings, screenshots, audio recordings, location
information, network activity, installed apps, browser bookmarks, and
external storage files. Lookout found evidence that the app is still
in active development and that an iOS equivalent may exist. 

 RESEARCHERS CRACK MICROSOFT AZURE MFA IN AN HOUR (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers from Oasis Security discovered an MFA bypass on one of
Microsoft Azure's MFA methods that could lead to the compromise of
Microsoft 365 accounts. The researchers discovered that the endpoint
did not implement rate limiting and that the auth period lasted for a
full three minutes as opposed to the recommended 30 seconds. The
researchers also discovered that an attacker could rapidly make many
auth attempts to enumerate the full 6-digit MFA space. 

 300,000+ PROMETHEUS SERVERS AND EXPORTERS EXPOSED TO DOS ATTACKS (9
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at Aquasec have found over 336,000 exposed Prometheus
servers and exporters, risking data breaches and DoS attacks.
Vulnerabilities like "RepoJacking" can lead to code execution through
compromised exporters. To mitigate risks, organizations should
prioritize authentication, limit public exposure, and secure debugging
endpoints.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURING AWS LAMBDA: HOW MISCONFIGURATIONS CAN LEAD TO LATERAL
MOVEMENT (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS Lambda functions are popular attack vectors for credentials theft
and lateral movement. This post presents a realistic application
architecture and walks through a scenario in which an attacker
exploits a vulnerability in a Lambda function to achieve code
execution and pivots to data exfiltration. It suggests using hardened
IAM roles, secure coding practices, and monitoring to mitigate Lambda
attacks. 

 RETROFITTING SPATIAL SECURITY TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF LINES OF C++
(7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google has made a large push to move to memory safe languages but in
the process is embracing hardening C++ to bridge the gap. The security
team has attempted to harden libc++ by adding bounds checking to
improve spatial security. The team started by integrating the changes
into the test and preproduction environment for a year before
promoting to production for all but a few exceptions. The safety
checks only add a 0.3% performance overhead, but they have resulted in
the discovery of over 1,000 bugs and successfully interfered with a
red team engagement. 

 EVERYDAY GHIDRA: GHIDRA DATA TYPES — CREATING CUSTOM GDTS FROM
WINDOWS HEADERS — PART 2 (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This second part of a guide on "Everyday Ghidra" explains how to
create custom Ghidra Data Type (GDT) files from Windows headers to
improve reverse engineering. You can ensure accurate and efficient
analysis of binaries by using a compiler to preprocess headers before
submission to Ghidra. Training Ghidra to use NDIS data types enhances
the decompilation process and reveals new structures and variables for
better analysis.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ZEROPATH RESEARCH REVEALS VULNERABILITIES IN POPULAR AI PLATFORMS AND
OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Since July 2024, ZeroPath's software has autonomously uncovered
critical zero-day vulnerabilities—including RCE, authentication
bypasses, and IDORs—in widely-used AI and open source tools. These
include security flaws in projects owned by Netflix, Salesforce, and
Hulu. See the full list [11] and read more about the methodology and
research [11]. 

 PIPE (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Pipe offers authenticated pub sub pipes over SSH with zero install. 

 PICKLESCAN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Picklescan is a CLI tool that can scan Python pickle files to detect
suspicious actions. It can load files from directories, URLs, zip
archives, or Hugging Face. 

 TERRAFORM PROVIDER FOR RCE VIA STATEFILE POISONING (GITHUB REPO) [14]


 This tool demonstrates the attack originally presented by Daniel
Grzelak in his "Hacking Terraform State for Privilege Escalation" blog
post from February. Turns out, this vulnerability is still open if an
attacker has access to your statefile. This could be a good tool for
red teams to demonstrate the risks of not securing Terraform
statefiles.

 OVER 600 VULNERABILITIES FOUND IN AVERAGE SOFTWARE CONTAINER (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 NetRise compiled advanced SBOMs for 70 of the most downloaded
containers on DockerHub and found that the average container had over
600 vulnerabilities. 45% of the vulnerabilities were 2-10 years old
and 7.9% were over 5 years old. 4.2% of high and critical
vulnerabilities were being actively exploited. NetRise also noted that
many components did not include manifests and emphasized the
importance of advanced SBOMs. 

 HACKING TERRAFORM STATE FOR PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (12 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 This article discusses hacking Terraform state for privilege
escalation by modifying the state file to control infrastructure
changes without a "terraform apply." Attackers can manipulate the
state file to delete resources or take over a deployment pipeline,
which is why it is important to secure and lock the Terraform state to
prevent unauthorized changes. The article highlights the need to use a
read-only role for "terraform plan" executions to inspect changes
without altering infrastructure until the deployment step. 

 RADIANT CAPITAL INCIDENT UPDATE (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Radiant Capital faced a cyberattack resulting in a $50M loss. It was
traced back to a DPRK-aligned threat actor using sophisticated
malware. Despite following best practices, the attackers evaded
detection by simulating benign transactions while executing malicious
ones in the background. The incident highlights the need for stronger
device-level security measures in the evolving DeFi industry to combat
advanced threats.
