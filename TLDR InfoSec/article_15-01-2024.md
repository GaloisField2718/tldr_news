 MEDUSA RANSOMWARE TURNING YOUR FILES INTO STONE (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Medusa ransomware group has increased attacks after launching a
dark web leak site in February 2023 to publish data from victims

similarly to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution by
targeting a misconfiguration.
