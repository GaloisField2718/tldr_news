What they found [4]: jailbreak prompts, deepfake-as-a-service
offerings, multilingual phishing kits, and custom language models
fine-tuned for fraud.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FIELDTEX DATA BREACH IMPACTS 238,000 (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Fieldtex Products, a US medical supply and contract sewing provider,
reported unauthorized access to its systems in mid-August that exposed
protected health information for about 238K individuals, including
names, addresses, dates of birth, insurance IDs, plan details, and
gender. Akira ransomware has claimed responsibility, saying it stole
over 14 GB of corporate, employee, customer, and financial data. 

 DATA BREACH AT CREDIT CHECK GIANT 700CREDIT AFFECTS AT LEAST 5.6
MILLION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacker accessed 700Credit's systems and stole personal data,
including names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security
numbers for at least 5.6 million people whose details were collected
by US auto dealerships between May and October. The company is
notifying victims by mail. Michigan's attorney general has urged
affected individuals to use credit freezes or monitoring to reduce
their risk of fraud. 

 HOME DEPOT EXPOSED ACCESS TO INTERNAL SYSTEMS FOR A YEAR, SAYS
RESEARCHER (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Security researcher Ben Zimmermann discovered an exposed GitHub
access token belonging to a Home Depot employee that granted access to
hundreds of private source code repositories, cloud infrastructure,
and critical systems, including order fulfillment and inventory
management, for approximately one year. Despite multiple attempts to
privately disclose the issue via email and LinkedIn to Home Depot's
CISO, Zimmermann received no response until TechCrunch contacted the
company, highlighting the absence of a vulnerability disclosure or bug
bounty program. Home Depot revoked the token's access following media
outreach, but has not confirmed whether logging capabilities exist to
determine if unauthorized parties accessed internal systems during the
exposure period.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WE GOT HIT BY SHAI-HULUD: A COMPLETE POST-MORTEM (18 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Shai-Hulud 2.0 is a malicious npm supply-chain worm that abuses
install-time scripts to run hidden malware on developer machines,
steal credentials with tools like TruffleHog, and then exfiltrate them
to attacker-controlled GitHub repositories using obfuscation
techniques such as multi-layer base64 encoding. With stolen tokens, it
can mass-clone private code, attempt destructive git operations, and,
if npm publish credentials exist, automatically republish trojanized
versions of popular packages, rapidly propagating through the
JavaScript ecosystem. Recommendations to prepare against it include
disabling npm scripts by default, adopting pnpm's safer defaults and
minimum package age, enforcing branch protection everywhere, and
moving to short-lived CI-based publishing via OIDC to eliminate
long-lived secrets on developer laptops. 

 A LOOK AT AN ANDROID ITW DNG EXPLOIT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Project Zero analyzed in-the-wild DNG image exploits targeting
Samsung's Quram image parsing library (CVE-2025-21042), discovered
through suspicious files uploaded to VirusTotal that were distributed
via WhatsApp and exploited Samsung's com.samsung.ipservice process
when images were automatically scanned. The vulnerability allowed
out-of-bounds writes through malformed DNG opcode parameters, which
attackers leveraged to corrupt heap metadata, bypass ASLR through
crafted MapTable operations that leaked library addresses, construct
JOP chains, and ultimately achieve system() command execution to
deploy spyware—all without control flow integrity mitigations like
PAC/BTI present in the Quram library. Samsung silently patched the
vulnerability in April by adding bounds checks to prevent plane index
overflows. The case demonstrates how image format specifications
provide powerful exploitation primitives that enable single-bug
exploits to achieve interactionless remote code execution and access
to all media store contents, capabilities that would likely have been
prevented by MTE deployment. 

 CAPABILITIES ARE THE ONLY WAY TO SECURE AGENT DELEGATION (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Traditional IAM systems are inadequate for securing AI agent
delegation because they verify identity rather than track authority
derivation across dynamic task chains, creating the Confused Deputy
problem where agents possess ambient permissions without understanding
their origin or intended scope. Capability-based authorization systems
address this by treating authority as cryptographically-signed tokens
that are explicitly passed between agents, monotonically attenuated at
each delegation hop, bound to holder keys for proof of possession, and
automatically expire when tasks complete. This model prevents prompt
injection attacks from escalating to data exfiltration by ensuring
agents can only exercise the specific, constrained authority delegated
to them rather than role-based permissions, making injection attempts
succeed at the language layer but fail at the authorization layer.

NetHunter support for Android 15/16 devices with Wifipumpkin3 preview
for rogue access point attacks, enhanced VM guest utilities support
for VirtualBox, VMware, and QEMU, and distribution changes requiring
BitTorrent for Live image downloads due to increased file sizes. Users
can upgrade existing installations via apt commands or download fresh
ISO images. The update focuses on improving both security testing
capabilities and user experience across desktop environments.

 NEW REACT VULNS LEAK SECRETS, INVITE DOS ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [15]


 React Server Components has three new CVEs on top of the already
exploited React2Shell bug that allow attackers to hang servers via
crafted HTTP requests and, in some cases, expose hardcoded secrets.
These affect multiple react-server-dom-* packages in versions
19.0.0–19.2.2, including prior “patched” releases, so
organizations are urged to update again and treat the situation with
Log4Shell-level seriousness. 

 THE US DIGITAL DOXXING OF H-1B APPLICANTS IS A MASSIVE PRIVACY
MISSTEP (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The US State Department mandated that H-1B visa applicants and their
H-4 dependents set all social media profiles to public starting
December 15, ostensibly to screen for national security threats
through “online presence reviews” that assess hostility toward US
institutions, effectively forcing digital exposure on over a million
technology workers and their families. This policy creates severe
security risks by providing foreign adversaries with free
organizational intelligence on defense contractors, chip makers, and
AI labs, exposing workers to spear-phishing, SIM swapping, recruitment
exploitation, and extortion tactics while turning legitimate employees
into attack vectors through publicly available personal data that can
be scraped and weaponized for deepfake impersonations and social
engineering. The mandatory public exposure normalizes
government-mandated privacy erosion while ironically creating the
intelligence security risks it aims to prevent, as sophisticated
threat actors using fake accounts remain hidden while legitimate
applicants become vulnerable targets with their professional
affiliations, family connections, and personal vulnerabilities exposed
to hostile nation-state surveillance operations. 

 KEY BARRIER TO ONLINE FRAUD CAN BE BYPASSED FOR PENNIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Researchers from the University of Cambridge have determined that SMS
numbers, which are commonly used by services to verify account
activation and combat fraud, can be readily purchased, typically for
less than 30 cents each. Costs varied by country, with the UK and
Russia selling for 10 cents at the lower end, and Australia and Japan
selling for $3-$5 at the higher end. The cost could also vary by
service, with throwaway numbers for WhatsApp costing more than those
for X.
