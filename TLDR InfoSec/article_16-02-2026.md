ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 300 MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT LEAKING OR STEALING USER
DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers discovered more than 300 malicious Chrome extensions with
37.4 million combined downloads that leaked browsing history, injected
iframes, and stole user data. 153 extensions were confirmed to
exfiltrate browser history immediately upon installation. A separate
LayerX report identified 30 extensions disguised as AI tools that
share identical internal structures and backend infrastructure, with
15 specifically targeting Gmail to extract email content and transmit
it to third-party servers. Organizations should audit installed
browser extensions against published indicators, enforce extension
allowlisting policies, and monitor for anomalous network traffic
originating from browser processes. 

 TOP DUTCH TELCO ODIDO ADMITS 6.2M CUSTOMERS CAUGHT IN CONTACT SYSTEM
CAPER (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Dutch mobile operator Odido has reported a breach of its customer
contact system that exposed data on about 6.2 million people,
including names, contact details, bank account information, and ID
information, but not passwords, call, or billing data. Odido is
notifying victims with tailored messages, warning about likely
phishing, impersonation, and fake invoices. 

 ALL US SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS MAY NEED TO BE CHANGED FOLLOWING A
MASSIVE BREACH THAT IS ALREADY BEING INVESTIGATED AS A NATIONAL THREAT
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A whistleblower alleges a federal tech team improperly cloned the
master Social Security database into a poorly governed cloud,
potentially exposing rich identity data on 300+ million Americans and
enabling long‑term fraud. Lawmakers have demanded criminal
investigations. Officials insist that core systems remain secure.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FOUNDATION PROBLEM: HOW A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS DESTROYING
CYBERSECURITY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cybersecurity's perceived talent shortage is actually a leadership
accountability gap. The Navy trains 18-year-olds to operate nuclear
reactors in 18 months through structured programs, while the security
industry demands unrealistic experience requirements and refuses to
invest in developing junior talent. There are three compounding
failures: superficial root-cause analysis that never addresses
underlying issues, unchecked technical debt that leaders fail to
translate into business risk, and the promotion of technical staff to
management roles without leadership training. Security leaders should
build structured development paths, conduct rigorous post-incident
analysis, and advocate for addressing technical debt as a core
business risk rather than accepting recurring failures as inevitable. 

 PRODUCT ENGINEERING TEAMS MUST OWN SUPPLY CHAIN RISK (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Modern software is assembled from third-party services, open-source
packages, and CI/CD tooling, turning the supply chain into a primary
attack surface rather than a background detail. Attacks like malicious
dependency updates exploit implicit trust in external code and can
silently compromise products, credentials, and customer data at scale.
Product teams must treat supply chain integrity as a top priority,
using provenance, cryptographic attestations, and the SLSA framework
to verify where software comes from and how it was built. 

 CONSUMER PROTECTION TUESDAY: HOW COINBASE SAFEGUARDS PII USING MPC
ENCRYPTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Coinbase's CoreKMS Encryption Service uses Multi-Party Computation
(MPC) to protect PII by deriving ephemeral encryption keys on demand
through Distributed Key Generation, ensuring no single party ever
holds the complete master key. The system employs AES-GCM-SIV for
deterministic, authenticated, field-level encryption of sensitive data
such as SSNs, enabling secure querying and indexing of encrypted
records in Snowflake without decrypting the underlying data. The
approach demonstrates a practical architecture for organizations that
need to balance regulatory compliance requirements, such as state
data-match reporting, with strong cryptographic guarantees against key
compromise.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AUTHID ANNOUNCES OUT OF THE BOX, BIOMETRIC SECURITY SOLUTION ALIGNED
WITH PIV SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR ENERGY AND OTHER CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 authID has launched a biometric security platform aligned with the
federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) framework, targeting
energy utilities and critical infrastructure by replacing passwords
and physical tokens with biometric authentication for SCADA consoles,
privileged accounts, and contractor access. The platform includes IDX
for centralized identity management across employees and third
parties, PrivacyKey for cryptographic biometric verification without
storing biometric data, and authID Mandate for locking down agentic AI
with user-bound audit trails. The release comes amid a 70%
year-over-year increase in utility cyberattacks in the US and growing
concerns over state-sponsored actors like Volt Typhoon pre-positioning
within critical infrastructure networks. 

 1PASSWORD OPEN SOURCES A BENCHMARK TO STOP AI AGENTS FROM LEAKING
CREDENTIALS (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 SCAM (Security Comprehension and Awareness Measure) is an open-source
benchmark from 1Password that tests whether AI agents behave safely in
real workflows, such as opening emails, retrieving credentials, and
filling out login forms. It addresses the gap where models that can
identify phishing when prompted still fall for attacks when operating
autonomously. Testing across eight frontier models revealed safety
scores ranging from 35% to 92%, with every model exhibiting critical
failures, such as entering credentials on phishing pages or forwarding
passwords to external parties. However, applying a short security
"skill file" dramatically reduced failures across all models. Released
under the MIT License, the benchmark includes 30 workplace scenarios,
a scoring framework, and video replay tooling to support enterprise AI
agent safety evaluation.

MISCELLANEOUS

 SNAIL MAIL LETTERS TARGET TREZOR AND LEDGER USERS IN CRYPTO-THEFT
ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Threat actors are sending physical letters impersonating Trezor and
Ledger security teams, urging hardware wallet users to complete fake
"Authentication Check" or "Transaction Check" processes by scanning QR
codes that lead to phishing sites designed to steal recovery phrases.
The campaign likely leverages customer data exposed in prior Trezor
and Ledger data breaches, with phishing domains such as
trezor.authentication-check[.]io exfiltrating submitted seed phrases
via a backend API endpoint. Hardware wallet manufacturers will never
request recovery phrases through mail, email, or websites — seed
phrases should only ever be entered directly on the hardware device
itself. 

 GOOGLE LINKS CHINA, IRAN, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA TO COORDINATED DEFENSE
SECTOR CYBER OPERATIONS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has published findings
detailing coordinated cyber operations by state-sponsored actors from
China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia targeting the defense industrial
base (DIB) sector across four key themes: battlefield technology theft
tied to the Russia-Ukraine war, employee targeting and hiring process
exploitation, edge device compromise by China-nexus groups, and supply
chain attacks through manufacturing breaches. Notable activity
includes APT44 exfiltrating Signal and Telegram data from devices
captured in Ukraine, Lazarus Group's continued Operation Dream Job
campaigns against aerospace and defense targets, and Volt Typhoon
conducting reconnaissance against North American military contractor
login portals. DIB organizations should prioritize secure messaging
hygiene, EDR evasion-aware detection strategies, and supply chain
integrity monitoring, given the persistent multi-vector nature of
these campaigns. 

 SENEGALESE DATA BREACHES EXPOSE LACK OF SECURITY MATURITY (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Ransomware gang Green Blood Group breached Senegal's national
biometric ID infrastructure, stealing highly sensitive data, including
birth records and ID card details for most of the country's 20 million
residents. The incident disrupted ID issuance, exposed weak cyber
governance, and sparked fears of long-term fraud and public mistrust
in digital government.
