 WORKOS ACQUIRES WARRANT, THE FINE GRAINED AUTHORIZATION (FGA) SERVICE
FOR DEVELOPERS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 WorkOS is bolstering its vision to become the world's best identity
platform with the acquisition of Warrant - an open source
authorization service.

Fine grained authorization (FGA) [4] determines¬†_who has access to
what_¬†and¬†_what they can do_¬†within an app. At scale this becomes a
significant engineering lift due to the need to implement complicated,
permutation-heavy logic.¬†

Warrant's product is based on Zanzibar, the open source authorization
system originally designed by Google [4] to power Google Docs and
YouTube. This enables FAST AUTHORIZATION CHECKS AT ENORMOUS SCALE
while maintaining a¬†FLEXIBLE MODEL¬†that can be adapted to even the
most complex use cases.

keystrokes. Together with a previous report on Sogou, Citizen Labs
estimates that up to one billion users are affected by these
vulnerabilities.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPLOITING EMBEDDED MITEL PHONES FOR UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE CODE
EXECUTION (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post describes how the author achieved unauthenticated remote
code execution on a Mitel IP phone. They gained full root access to
the device by exploiting vulnerabilities like command injection.

 HOW TO BLOCK EXECUTABLE FILE UPLOADS IN PHP (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post explains how you can prevent executable file uploads in PHP
by calling a free API during the upload process that verifies file
formats. By setting $allow_executables to false and optionally
providing a $restrict_file_types whitelist, the API checks against 17+
million virus/malware signatures and rigorously verifies accepted
formats, blocking executables and other threatening file types. 

 SECURING MILLIONS OF DEVELOPERS THROUGH 2FA (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 GitHub CSO Mike Hanley writes about their journey to implement a 2FA
initiative to enhance software supply chain security by requiring
developers to enable 2FA. The results showed a significant increase in

further improve account security measures in the future.

 GODFATHER BANKING TROJAN SPAWNS 1.2K SAMPLES ACROSS 57 COUNTRIES (5
MINUTE READ) [14]

Trojan are circulating worldwide, targeting hundreds of banking apps

 GOOGLE'S CONTROVERSIAL MOVE TO KILL THE WEB COOKIE JUST GOT DELAYED
UNTIL 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google is further postponing its plan to phase out third-party
cookies on Chrome, citing ongoing challenges in reconciling feedback
from the industry, regulators, and developers. The long-delayed move
to remove the small data files used for cross-site user tracking and
ad targeting was originally announced in 2020 but has faced multiple

 (THE) POSTMAN CARRIES LOTS OF SECRETS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Postman's Public API Network is unknowingly leaking thousands of live
credentials from popular SaaS and cloud providers. The exposure of
sensitive information is due to an unclear UI, ambiguous taxonomy, and
the practice of publicly forking collections containing live API keys.
Despite Postman's basic secret scanner, there is a significant risk of
leaking secrets due to insufficient scanning and misleading
terminology like "secret" environment variables.
