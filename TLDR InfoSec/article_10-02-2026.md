 THE DARK SIDE OF AI: 2.6MM UNDERGROUND MESSAGES ANALYZED (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Flashpoint just released a massive study of the AI threat landscape.
Analysts monitored over 2.6 MILLION AI-RELATED POSTS across Telegram,
the dark web, and underground LLM forums.

The findings are a wake-up call [4]. Threat actors are no longer just
"experimenting" — they are deploying:

 	* DEEPFAKE-AS-A-SERVICE for sophisticated social engineering.
 	* MULTILINGUAL PHISHING KITS that erase language barriers.
 	* FRAUD-GPTS: Custom LLMs fine-tuned specifically for malicious
activity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BREAKING DOWN CVE-2026-25049: HOW TYPESCRIPT TYPES FAILED N8N'S
SECURITY (8 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CVE-2026-25049 (CVSS 9.4) exploits a type confusion flaw in n8n's
expression evaluator, bypassing a prior security patch by sending
object inputs instead of strings — since TypeScript types are
stripped at compile-time, the runtime sanitizer never executed.
Attackers use JavaScript destructuring to access the Function
constructor and achieve unauthenticated RCE via public webhook
endpoints, exposing stored credentials, API keys, and internal network
access. Users should upgrade to n8n versions 1.123.17 or 2.5.2 and
implement runtime type validation using typeof checks or a schema
validation library such as Zod. 

 EUROPEAN COMMISSION DISCLOSES BREACH THAT EXPOSED STAFF DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The European Commission is investigating a breach after finding
evidence that its mobile device management (MDM) platform was hacked.
It has not found any evidence that mobile devices were compromised,
but confirmed that attackers have accessed some staff members'
personal information, such as names and phone numbers. The European
Commission did not disclose how the attackers compromised its MDM
system, but the attack shows similarities with other attacks on
European institutions that exploit vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint
Manager Mobile software. 

 BEYONDTRUST WARNS OF CRITICAL RCE FLAW IN REMOTE SUPPORT SOFTWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BeyondTrust warned customers to patch a critical vulnerability in its
Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access software that could allow
unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via OS command
injection. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated
attackers without requiring user interaction by sending specially
crafted client requests. BeyondTrust has secured all cloud systems and
advises all on-premises customers to patch their systems manually if
they haven't enabled auto updates.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE PHANTOM FILE SYSTEM: INSIDE THE WINDOWS PROJFS (14 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The Windows Projected File System (ProjFS) operates as a minifilter
(prjflt.sys) rather than a true filesystem, using reparse points and
filter communication ports to project virtual files on demand.
Offensively, medium-integrity users can launch ProjFS providers
without admin privileges, prevent higher-privileged processes from
deleting files, and serve different file contents per process — all
potential avenues for evasion and persistence. Defensively, ProjFS
offers a lightweight alternative to custom minifilters for deploying
canary files with rich callback data, including triggering process ID
and image path, particularly relevant as Microsoft moves toward
reducing kernel-mode dependencies. 

 HOW TO RECOGNIZE A DEEPFAKE: ATTACK OF THE CLONES (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 This post outlines practical techniques for identifying deepfake
scams across video calls, voice messages, and photos. Modern neural
networks can clone a voice from just three to five seconds of audio.
Key detection methods include requesting head turns to break face-swap
algorithms, watching for lip-sync delays of even 100 milliseconds, and
using pre-agreed codewords for identity verification. Organizations
and individuals are advised to restrict public access to photos and
voice recordings, enable 2FA on all accounts, and use content analysis
tools such as Sensity AI and Deepware for automated detection. 

 UNCOVERING THREATS THROUGH WAF LOGS: A THREAT HUNTER'S LENS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 WAF logs are often overlooked in threat hunting because every request
must pass through them. Defenders can look for potential
reconnaissance patterns, including using non-standard HTTP methods on
public pages, CMS helper endpoint exposure, systematic enumeration
across multiple sites, and infrastructure-based anomalies such as TOR
exit nodes. The article also includes KQL queries for practical threat
detection.

 PHANTOMFS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PhantomFS is a Windows ProjFS-based tool that projects virtual files
whose content varies by the requesting process, serving
AES-256-CBC-encrypted payloads to allowed processes (e.g., cmd.exe)
while returning decoy bytes to all others. Inspired by Huntress'
recent ProjFS research, the tool runs at medium integrity without
admin privileges and blocks delete/rename attempts from non-allowed
processes. Detection is possible via ProjFS reparse points, the PrjFlt
minifilter at filter altitude 189800, and the Microsoft-Windows-ProjFS
ETW provider.

 17% OF 3RD-PARTY ADD-ONS FOR OPENCLAW USED IN CRYPTO THEFT AND MACOS
MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 17% of third-party "skills" for the popular open-source AI tool
OpenClaw, which has over 160,000 GitHub stars, are malicious. Over
half (54%) of these threats target cryptocurrency users with fake
wallet trackers, DEX tools, and Solana/Phantom utilities. One user
account, sakaen736jih, is associated with 199 malicious skills that
steal private wallet keys and deploy AMOS Stealer malware on macOS.
The malware campaign has extended into corporate settings, leading
Bitdefender to develop a free AI Skills Checker tool to help users vet
add-ons before installing. 

 MY TOP 5 RECOMMENDATIONS ON OT CYBERSECURITY STUDENT UPSCALING (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A guide from Lesley Carhart, aka hacks4pancakes, on the skills
prospective Operational Technology (OT) students should focus on.
Students should focus more on processes and systems of systems rather
than hacking individual devices. Start with one process, consider
safety and process continuity, since most OT engagements involve
critical systems, and get comfortable with older computers. The post
also includes a list of free learning resources.
