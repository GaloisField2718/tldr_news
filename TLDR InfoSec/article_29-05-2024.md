STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BEST PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS IN 2024 (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Penetration testing tools are essential for efficient hacking and
security assessments. While hacking without tools is possible, it is
time-consuming and repetitive. These tools streamline basic scanning
and security processes, saving time and effort. This post dives into
some of the best penetration testing tools. 

 STOP RECOMMENDING JWTS (WITH SYMMETRIC KEYS) (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Truffle Security team analyzed 10k JWTs found via Shodan and
another 500 committed to public repos in GitHub. They used hashcat to
attempt cracking the JWTs and found that 1.2% of symmetric keys used
in production were guessable within seconds. This was caused by users
implementing weak passwords (including the defaults used in
documentation and examples) as their symmetric keys when setting up
their authentication systems. 

 A BASIC GUIDE TO DISCOVERING ATTACK SURFACE WITH GHIDRA AND GDB (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post provides a walkthrough on how to programmatically map
the attack surface of an application using GDB and Ghidra. It begins
with walking through the strategy for identifying functions after ASLR
and then shows how it can be implemented using GDB Python. The post
takes this one step further and shows how to write a Ghidra Python
script to generate the GDB Python script for each function and ignore
artificially generated blocks.

 SNAP WTF MACOS (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 WTF Snapshot fuzzing of macOS targets, enabling users to perform
precisely targeted fuzz testing of hard-to-pinpoint chunks of the
macOS kernel. 

 ARCJET JS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Arcjet JS SDKs. Rate limiting, bot protection, email verification,
and attack defense for Node.js, Next.js, Bun, and SvelteKit. 

 SUDO FOR WINDOWS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Sudo for Windows is a windows-specific implementation of the Sudo
concept to escalate privilege from Linux/Unix. This means that certain
elements of the traditional sudo experience are not present in Sudo
for Windows and vice versa. Scripts and documentation that are written
for sudo may not be able to be used directly with Sudo for Windows
without some modification.

of independent oversight. 

 A ROOT SERVER AT THE INTERNET'S CORE LOST TOUCH WITH ITS PEERS. WE
STILL DON'T KNOW WHY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 For more than 4 days, the Cogent root name server fell out of sync
with all 12 of its peers. Cogent has fixed the issue but has refused
to comment on the cause of the disparity. This could have led to DNS
Cache poisoning issues or issues in DNSSEC. 

 AI RED TEAMING TOOLS HELPED X-FORCE BREAK INTO A TECH MANUFACTURER IN
8 HOURS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 IBM reported that its X-Force red team was able to compromise a
network that they had allocated 3 weeks for in just 8 hours with the
help of AI red teaming tools. The team found a vulnerability in the
company's HR portal with the aid of the tooling and then installed a
rootkit after exploiting the vulnerability and eventually pivoted
through the network. IBM believes that these AI tools can be essential
in analyzing the large volume of data accumulated in a red team
assessment.
