ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NORTH KOREA-LINKED HACKERS POSE AS HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 South Korean cybersecurity firm Genians has flagged a new APT
campaign led by the North Korean Konni hacking cluster. The attackers
are targeting victims with spearphishing emails posing as North Korean
human rights activists and South Korean financial institutions. The
attackers use common click-tracking services to obfuscate the redirect
links used to deliver malware. 

 MANY BLUETOOTH DEVICES WITH GOOGLE FAST PAIR VULNERABLE TO
WHISPERPAIR ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Belgian security experts have identified a new flaw in Bluetooth
devices using Google's Fast Pair. This vulnerability enables attackers
to take control of devices to manage audio, track location, or listen
to microphone audio. The issue occurs because devices accept Fast Pair
connections even outside pairing mode. An attacker can hijack a device
in about 10 seconds from a distance of up to 14 meters. 

 ALL YOUR OPENCODES BELONG TO US (7 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 OpenCode versions before v1.1.10 contained a critical RCE
vulnerability via an unauthenticated HTTP server that exposed
endpoints for arbitrary shell command execution, interactive terminal
session creation, and arbitrary file reads. The vulnerability also
enabled prompt injection into the LLM's context window, creating a
secondary attack vector to manipulate the AI agent into exfiltrating
data or performing malicious actions. Thousands of developers'
machines were exposed with near-zero sandboxing, meaning agents had
full access to SSH keys, cloud credentials, and browser cookies, with
no audit trail of potential compromise.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SERVICENOW BODYSNATCHER FLAW HIGHLIGHTS RISKS OF RUSHED AI
INTEGRATIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 BodySnatcher is a critical vulnerability in ServiceNow's Now Assist
AI Agents and Virtual Agent API that allows unauthenticated attackers
to execute agentic workflows as any user by exploiting weak
authentication defaults and auto-linking features—potentially
creating backdoor admin accounts. ServiceNow patched hosted instances
in late October (Now Assist AI Agents 5.1.18/5.2.19+ and Virtual Agent
API 3.15.2/4.0.4+), but the underlying misconfigurations may persist
in custom code and third-party integrations. Organizations should
enforce MFA with proper validation scripts for Virtual Agent API
providers, enable AI steward approval in AI Control Tower, and
regularly audit and disable unused AI agents. 

 KUBERNETES V1.35: RESTRICTING EXECUTABLES INVOKED BY KUBECONFIGS VIA
EXEC PLUGIN ALLOWLIST ADDED TO KUBERC (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 kubeconfigs can run any executable via the configured exec plugin,
which is used to obtain credentials. Kubernetes v1.35 adds two new
fields, credentialPluginPolicy and credentialPluginAllowlist, which
can be used to restrict the executables that are available to kubectl
for obtaining credentials. Currently, the only supported attribute for
the allow list is `name` (for an executable name or path), but the SIG
is looking to add further support, such as checksums, in the future. 

 HOW A HACKING CAMPAIGN TARGETED HIGH-PROFILE GMAIL AND WHATSAPP USERS
ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TechCrunch has received a sample of a phishing link that is being
sent to those connected to “Iran-related activities” from a
UK-based Iranian activist. The initial contact is sent to the victim
via WhatsApp and contains a phishing link that directs them to a
malicious site that attempts to steal the victim's Gmail credentials,
hijack the victim's WhatsApp account, monitor the victim's location,
and capture audio and video. The attackers use the DuckDNS dynamic DNS
provider to mask their links.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 YOUR CNAPP DETECTS. TURBOT PREVENTS. (SPONSOR) [10] 

 CNAPPs provide visibility into cloud risks but rely on manual
remediation after deployment. Pair them with preventive controls and
shift from reactive to proactive. Turbot Guardrails [11] doesn't just
scan and alert. It blocks misconfigurations in build, at the cloud
provider API, and auto-remediates drift in runtime, preventing issues
regardless of how they're introduced. Learn more. [11] 

 COLOG (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 CoLog is a unified framework for detecting point and collective
anomalies in operating system logs via collaborative transformers. 

 AGENTIC THREAT HUNTING FRAMEWORK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Agentic Threat Hunting Framework (ATHF) provides a memory and
automation layer for threat-hunting programs. It can integrate with
any threat-hunting methodology, making existing programs AI-ready. 

 HEIMDALL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Heimdall is an AWS security scanner that discovers privilege
escalation paths by detecting 50+ IAM privesc patterns, analyzing 85+
attack chains with MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and scanning 10 AWS services
for cross-service escalation vectors. The tool includes a Terraform
engine for shift-left security that identifies IAM attack paths in
infrastructure-as-code before deployment, differentiating it from
static config scanners like tfsec or checkov. Features include an
interactive TUI, one-command dashboard, multi-hop path detection
through role chains, and SARIF export for GitHub Security integration.

 AWS ENDS SSE-C ENCRYPTION, AND A RANSOMWARE VECTOR (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 AWS will end support for AWS SSE-C as an encryption option for S3,
following its discovery in ransomware campaigns. SSE-C was a rarely
used encryption method for S3 that allowed customers to supply an
encryption key for use in S3 API requests. This was useful for
ransomware operators because AWS never had access to the key, and it
was quieter than alternative methods like KMS. Organizations can use
KMS with customer-managed keys (CMK) or client-side encryption to
replace the functionality. 

 BLINK AND YOU'LL MISS THEM: 6-DAY CERTIFICATES ARE HERE! (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Let's Encrypt has made 6-day TLS certificates publicly available
through its short-lived certificate profile, well ahead of the 2029
industry mandate that reduces maximum validity to 47 days. Google
Trust Services also offers short-lived certificates with configurable
validity periods as short as a single day. Organizations already using
ACME clients for automation can adopt these shorter validity periods
with minimal operational changes, since the increased renewal
frequency is handled automatically. 

 INGRAM MICRO ADMITS SUMMER RANSOMWARE RAID EXPOSED THOUSANDS OF STAFF
RECORDS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Ingram Micro disclosed that the SafePay ransomware group's July 2025
attack compromised the personal data of 42,521 employees and job
applicants, including names, identity document numbers (passports,
driver's licenses, and SSNs), and employment evaluations. The
attackers claimed to have stolen 3.5 TB of data, and the incident
forced system shutdowns that prevented MSPs from managing customer
services and sent some regional staff home. Customers criticized the
distributor's poor communication during the incident, with some unable
to locate attack updates without external assistance.
