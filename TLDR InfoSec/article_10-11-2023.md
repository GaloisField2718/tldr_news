 50 SHADES OF VULNERABILITIES: UNCOVERING FLAWS IN OPEN-SOURCE
VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURES (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Aqua Nautilus researchers found flaws in the vulnerability disclosure
process for tens of thousands of open-source projects. These flaws

states in the vulnerability disclosure process: 'Half-Day' and
'0.75-Day' Vulnerability.
