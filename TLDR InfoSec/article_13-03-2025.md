ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TATA TECHNOLOGIES' DATA LEAKED BY RANSOMWARE GANG (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Ransomware group Hunters International has leaked over 730,000
documents (1.4 TB) from Tata Technologies, including employee
information and confidential contracts. Tata had reported a ransomware
attack in January that impacted "a few" IT assets. 

 POWERSCHOOL PORTAL COMPROMISED MONTHS BEFORE MASSIVE DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hackers accessed PowerSchool's support portal months before a
December 2024 data breach, potentially impacting 70 million
individuals. They used compromised credentials to steal personal data,
including names, contact details, birth dates, medical information,
and Social Security numbers. 

 PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED BOTNET TARGETS UNPATCHED TP-LINK ARCHER HOME
ROUTERS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cato Networks has detected a new botnet named Ballista that is
targeting unpatched TP-Link Archer routers using the CVE-2023-1389
exploit. Researchers suggest the hacker is likely from Italy and that
the botnet is in its early stages, with evolving malware capabilities.
Unlike other DDoS-for-hire botnets, Ballista's malware can also
execute arbitrary commands on remote systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AZURE'S WEAKEST LINK? HOW API CONNECTIONS SPILL SECRETS (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Binary Security found undocumented Azure API Connections enabling
privilege escalation. With Reader permissions, attackers can GET
requests to backend resources like Key Vaults, Defender ATP, and
third-party services such as Jira and Salesforce. 

 COPYOBJECTION: FENDING OFF RANSOMWARE IN AWS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers are using SSE-C to encrypt objects in ransomware attacks on
AWS accounts. Jesse Griggs established a test environment to measure
the alert response time through CloudWatch and how quickly Lambda
could block the attacker or disable SSE-C. He noted alerts took about
6 minutes to arrive, while automated responses occurred immediately. 

 BEYOND THE HOOK: A TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE INTO MODERN PHISHING
METHODOLOGIES (31 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article explores modern phishing techniques, from basic HTML
pages to those that bypass multi-factor authentication. It covers
attack methods such as Browser-in-the-Browser (BITB),
Attacker-in-the-Middle (AITM), and WebRTC, as well as infrastructure
considerations for hosting and delivery. Phishing has evolved with
sophisticated techniques using cloud provider domains, making
detection harder. Effective defense requires multi-layered approaches
combining technical controls and human awareness.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CISA WORKER SAYS 100-STRONG RED TEAM FIRED AFTER DOGE CANCELLED
CONTRACT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 CISA's 100-member penetration testing team was terminated after
Trump's DOGE unit canceled their contract, leading to cuts in another
red team. The election security group EI-ISAC also shut down due to
funding loss, raising concerns about cyberattack vulnerabilities. 

 IN-DEPTH TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BYBIT HACK (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Bybit experienced the largest cryptocurrency theft ever, totaling
$1.4 billion, when attackers compromised a developer machine and
injected malicious JavaScript into Safe{Wallet} UI, altering what
signers saw. This off-chain attack tricked signers into approving a
delegatecall that replaced the proxy implementation with the
attackers' code, giving them control over all funds. The Lazarus group
from North Korea executed this sophisticated attack by exploiting
human verification vulnerabilities and the lack of human-readable
formats for complex smart contract operations in the EIP-712 standard.


 RESEARCH UNVEILS THAT MORE THAN 110,000 IOS APPS LEAK SECRETS (8
MINUTE READ) [17]

cloud storage keys. Most apps expose at least one hardcoded secret,
risking user breaches. Apple's App Store does not check for these
vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for better security practices.
