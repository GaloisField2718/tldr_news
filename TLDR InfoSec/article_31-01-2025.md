 INTRODUCTION TO DETECTION ENGINEERING WITH SIGMA (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sigma provides a backend-neutral detection signature language for
logs that can be converted to a variety of different query languages
such as Splunk SPL or Sentinel KQL. This post walks through a Sigma
rule to explain the components and syntax. It then introduces some
more advanced features such as pipelines to resolve mapping issues
between rules and data sources and correlation rules to provide
stateful detections.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BACKLINE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [10] 

 Backline's AI agents act as software and security engineers,
analyzing potential vulnerabilities, collecting context, and
determining how to optimally address an issue for the customer's
specific environment. The agents then autonomously implement the
needed code and configuration changes. 

 SECORA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SeCoRa is an AI-powered code review tool for detecting and
remediating vulnerabilities in codebases. 

 YARAMONITOR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 YaraMonitor is a tool that monitors malware samples using YARA rules.
It continuously analyzes and alerts on new uploads from sources like
MalwareBazaar and can be extended to monitor additional sources.
Running the main.py script from the root folder will automate the
ingestion and scanning process for malware samples.

 DATA SAFETY LEVELS FRAMEWORK: THE FOUNDATION OF HOW WE LOOK AT DATA
IN BLOCK (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cash App's security team devised a Data Safety Levels (DSL) Framework
based on the CDC's biosafety levels to utilize for data
classification. The framework takes a dataset level approach to devise
standardized rubrics for evaluating data based on its usage such as
Consumer Personal Data and Payment Card Data. The framework couples
with automation to be able to classify data as part of Block teams'
regular workflows as well as guidelines on how to handle data of
various sensitivity levels.
