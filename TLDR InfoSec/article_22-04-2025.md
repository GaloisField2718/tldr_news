TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-04-22

 NAVIGATING AZURE MFA MANDATES AND BEYOND WITH CISCO DUO AND MICROSOFT
SECURITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Microsoft now requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Admins
to sign-into Azure.

Watch this on-demand webinar featuring Microsoft Security and Cisco
Duo [4] to learn how you can easily navigate this change - and use it
as an opportunity. Learn how to:

 	* Easily protect logins to Microsoft Azure and more with Duo
 	* Streamline access management to ensure the MFA mandate doesn't
frustrate end users [4] and admins alike
 	* Elevate your security game by moving beyond basic MFA and adopt a
powerful identity security program featuring Security Posture
Management (ISPM) and Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR).

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BEWARE OF THIS SNEAKY GOOGLE PHISHING SCAM (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Phishing scammers are bypassing Google's DKIM authentication by using
Google Sites to send fake "subpoena alerts" that appear to come from
"no-reply@google.com." The scam creates authentic-looking emails by
entering email text as an app name, which Google automatically sends
and then links directly to sites.google.com instead of
accounts.google.com to steal credentials. 

 WIDESPREAD MICROSOFT ENTRA LOCKOUTS TIED TO NEW SECURITY FEATURE
ROLLOUT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 On Saturday, Windows admins from numerous organizations reported
widespread account lockouts triggered by false positives in the
rollout of Microsoft Entra ID's new MACE leaked credentials detection
app. Microsoft notified users that the alarms were not caused by
actual breaches but rather the invalidation of user refresh tokens
that were mistakenly logged into their systems. 

 NORTH KOREAN CRYPTOCURRENCY THIEVES CAUGHT HIJACKING ‘REMOTE
CONTROL' FEATURE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The non-profit Security Alliance (SEAL) and Trail of Bits have both
released advisories regarding a North Korean social engineering
campaign that involves masquerading as VC investors. The threat actors
send victims a Calendly link to schedule a Zoom call with a PR pitch
to appear on a podcast run by Aureon Capital. If a victim accepts the
meeting, the attackers ask the victim to share their screen to present
their work and at some point will request ‘Remote Control' while
changing their display name to Zoom to make the notification mimic a
system notification. The attackers use this access to deploy either
infostealers or full RATs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IN DEPTH WITH WINDOWS 11 RECALL—AND WHAT MICROSOFT HAS (AND HASN'T)
FIXED (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft's revamped Recall feature for Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs
addresses previous security concerns by making it opt-in, encrypting
data, and adding automated filtering for sensitive information.
Despite these improvements, the feature still has filtering
limitations and lingering trust issues from its botched initial
rollout. 

 IOT NETWORK SECURITY: ANALYZING DECRYPTED ZIGBEE TRAFFIC DATA (12
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This study presents ZigBeeNet, a dataset of decrypted Zigbee IoT
network traffic from a smart home with 15 devices. By extracting the
network key, researchers could analyze device behavior, identify
security vulnerabilities, and optimize network performance. The data
addresses key challenges in analyzing encrypted Internet of Things
(IoT) communications. 

 THE COMPLEXITY OF DETECTING AMAZON S3 AND KMS RANSOMWARE (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 S3 and KMS ransomware attacks are challenging to detect, as many
techniques can only be detected in S3 Access Logs or CloudTrail data
events, which can be costly and are not enabled by default. This post
provides IoCs for 11 different indicators of cloud ransomware. It also
includes an advanced event selector for CloudTrail, which can target a
specific bucket to enable more fine-grained logging on sensitive
buckets.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MICROSOFT RATED THIS BUG AS LOW EXPLOITABILITY. MISCREANTS WEAPONIZED
IT IN JUST 8 DAYS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A Microsoft Windows NTLM hash-leaking vulnerability (CVE-2025-24054)
was weaponized just eight days after Patch Tuesday. Initially
exploiting victims through Dropbox-hosted ZIP files, the attackers,
which targeted Poland and Romania, evolved to sending standalone
malicious files directly. 

 CISA WARNS THREAT HUNTING STAFF OF END TO GOOGLE, CENSYS CONTRACTS AS
AGENCY CUTS SET IN (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 CISA staff members were notified that, as part of the agency's
cost-cutting measures, the organization has discontinued its use of
Censys and plans to cease using VirusTotal. Staff members were
notified that an effort would be made to identify alternative tools to
ensure minimal disruption, but no further details were provided. CISA
is also investigating the termination of all threat-hunting contracts
with the private sector. 

 RUNTIME CLOUD SECURITY IN 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CNAPP has grown to include many tools, but most application-related
tools were added later and lack comprehensiveness. Modern attacks like
MoveIT are hard to detect, yet Cloud Application Detection and
Response (CADR) shows promise in using application context to block
such attacks early. No current solution fully realizes CADR's
potential, but ARMo, Sweet, Upwind, Oligo, Operant, and Raven are the
closest.
