ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HEALTHCARE SAAS FIRM SAYS DATA BREACH IMPACTS 5.4M PATIENTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Episource, a healthcare services company that provides risk
adjustment, medical coding, data analytics, and technology solutions
to health plans and providers, is warning impacted patients of a data
breach that it suffered in January. The breached data may have
included full names, physical addresses, email addresses, phone

 NORTH KOREA TARGETING INDIAN CRYPTO JOB APPLICANTS WITH MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cisco Talos is warning potential crypto job seekers in India of a
malware campaign by the North Korean Famous Chollima group. Fake
employers are approaching software engineers, marketing employees, and
designers with skill-testing pages to apply for positions at
cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Archblock, and Robinhood.
These pages feature ClickFix attacks, which prompt victims to run
malicious code to fix errors. The code eventually downloads
infostealer malware to steal browser credentials and session tokens.

MINUTE READ) [8]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DANGEROUS BY DEFAULT: INSECURE GITHUB ACTIONS FOUND IN MITRE, SPLUNK,
AND OTHER OPEN SOURCE REPOSITORIES (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The `pull_request_target` event is infamous because it opens up room
for abuse by running in the context of the base repo with full secrets
access and write permissions to the GITHUB_TOKEN. Sysdig found
repositories belonging to MITRE, Splunk, and a popular open-source
Spotify client that could be hijacked via `pull_request_target` abuse.
Sysdig recommends using the `pull_request` event instead, along with
workflow splitting and restricting GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to avoid
these issues. 

 DIGGING TUNNELS: HUNTING ADVERSARIAL CLOUDFLARED INSTANCES (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Cloudflared is a popular tunneling service offered by Cloudflare that
legitimate organizations or adversaries can utilize to establish
persistence. Cloudflared authenticates using tokens that contain the
account ID, tunnel ID, and a secret. Ransomware groups often do not
vary their Cloudflare accounts, so detecting anomalous tokens or
renamed processes can be effective for threat hunting.
