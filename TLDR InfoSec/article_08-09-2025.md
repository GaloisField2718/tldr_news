ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL SAP VULNERABILITY CVE-2025-42957 ACTIVELY EXPLOITED BY
HACKERS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers are exploiting a critical CVE in SAP S/4HANA that enables
low-level users to gain admin control. The flaw affects multiple
versions, risking data theft, backdoors, and ransomware. SAP released
patches on August 12. Organizations should update immediately, as the
Dutch NCSC issued a medium-high priority advisory on September 5. 

 DARK WEB VENDOR CLAIMS BREACH OF ANUVU AWS EMPLOYEE DATA (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A dark web vendor claims to have breached Anuvu (formerly Global
Eagle), a major satellite provider for airlines and cruise lines,
allegedly obtaining over 70 admin credentials for internal services
like AWS and Postgres databases. The stolen data includes sensitive
employee info, customer databases, and Starlink contract details,
potentially exposing users of in-flight connectivity. Researchers
verified parts of the data appear legitimate and warned that the
breach could enable targeted phishing and credential stuffing attacks
against airline partners like Air France, Delta, Southwest, and
British Airways. 

 ICLOUD CALENDAR ABUSED TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS FROM APPLE'S SERVERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new phishing campaign that leverages iCloud Calendar invites was
reported to BleepingComputer. The phishing email notifies the user
that their PayPal account is being charged and requests the user to
call a given phone number. The notable thing is that the email is sent
from Apple's servers because the attackers add the user's email to an
Office 365 group, which they invite to the event, and include the
phishing text in the Notes field.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT FRAMING SECURITY ALERTS AS A BINARY TRUE OR FALSE POSITIVE IS
COSTING YOU (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The true/false positive binaries only capture whether an alert
accurately alerts on a signal, but not if it is impactful. The author
proposes adding a layer of intent or disposition to alert metrics to
measure whether the alert had an actual business impact. This leads to
a refined classification with the steps: True Positive - Malicious,
True Positive - Suspicious, True Positive - No Business Impact, and
False Positive. 

 SECURING MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) WITH TELEPORT AND AWS (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MCPs pose security issues like poor auditing, insecure credentials,
and excessive privileges. Teleport offers a Unified Identity
Framework, giving each MCP a unique cryptographic identity with
dynamic credentials, fine-grained access, and thorough logging. This
post covers deploying and securing MCP access to a database. 

 DETECTING ADCS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Active Directory Certificate Service (ADCS) is used in Active
Directory environments to manage certificates for systems, users,
applications, and more, and provides a variety of potential privilege
escalation vectors. ADCS logging is not enabled by default and must be
enabled via certsrv. This post demonstrates how to create and test KQL
alerts for a common privilege escalation technique.

 MALICIOUS PDF GENERATOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The repository contains ten variations of malicious PDF files that
include phone-home features. These can be used with Burp Collaborator
or Interact.sh. 

 GHBUSTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ghbuster is a tool from Datadog that detects suspicious GitHub users
and repos using heuristics. The tool analyzes patterns like
coordinated star manipulation, commits from unlinked emails, users
with only forked repositories, and accounts with minimal community
activity to flag threat actors weaponizing trust in the open-source
ecosystem. It provides a command-line interface with modular detection
rules and requires a GitHub API token. 

 FINCH (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Finch is a fingerprint-aware TLS reverse-proxy that inspects TLS
handshakes and HTTP requests to extract JA3, JA4, JA4H, and Akamai
HTTP/2 fingerprints, then evaluates them against hot-reloadable rules.

 VIRUSTOTAL FINDS HIDDEN MALWARE PHISHING CAMPAIGN IN SVG FILES (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 VirusTotal discovered a phishing campaign using SVG files with
embedded JavaScript to impersonate Colombia's judicial system,
delivering malware through fake government portals. The campaign used
44 unique SVG files that evaded all antivirus engines but were
detected by VirusTotal's AI Code Insight feature, which also uncovered
523 additional samples dating back to August. The malicious SVGs
create convincing fake judicial portals with progress bars and
security tokens, while secretly downloading ZIP archives containing
malware to victims' systems.

risk divestment. It plans to appeal. 

 CZECH CYBER AGENCY NUKIB FLAGS CHINESE ESPIONAGE RISKS TO CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Czech cybersecurity agency NUKIB warned of increasing risks from
Chinese-linked technologies in vital sectors such as energy,
healthcare, transport, and government, citing APT31's attacks on Czech
ministries. The agency pointed out risks from Chinese devices like IP
cameras, PV inverters, smart meters, phones, cars, and AI models that
can send data to or be controlled remotely from China. NUKIB stressed
that Chinese laws give authorities broad powers to access data and
force private companies to cooperate in state-led spying, urging Czech
organizations to implement proper protections against these cyber
threats.
