 STRUGGLING WITH NEW MFA REQUIREMENTS FOR AZURE? KNOCK THEM OUT OF THE
PARK WITH DUO (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Earlier this year, Microsoft made MFA mandatory on all Azure logins.
IT and security teams were faced with the daunting task of forcing
_everyone_ to transition all at once.

With Cisco Duo [4], you can easily meet MFA requirements, and use them
as an opportunity to roll out even-better security measures, such as
continuous identity security.

Watch this recorded webinar [4] to learn how to meet MFA requirements
without frustrating end users or admins, use strong forms of MFA, and
go the extra mile with Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) and
Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR).

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT SPOTLIGHT: HIJACKED AND HIDDEN: NEW BACKDOOR AND PERSISTENCE
TECHNIQUE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ReliaQuest discovered a sophisticated attack chain in March 2025 that
targeted finance and professional services sectors. It begins with
Microsoft Teams phishing but evolves into a novel persistence
technique that involves Component Object Model Type Library hijacking.
The attack deploys previously unseen malware with a PowerShell
backdoor that uses Telegram for command and control, showing
similarities to earlier campaigns attributed to the "Storm-1811"
threat group known for deploying Black Basta ransomware. To defend
against these tactics, organizations should restrict external
Microsoft Teams communications, block specific domains at the network
edge, and implement various Windows security hardening measures.
