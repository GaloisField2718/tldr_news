 1PASSWORD WEBINAR: SECURITY IN THE AGE OF AI AGENTS AND SHADOW IT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In the age of AI and SaaS, IT and security leaders are confronting a
new reality. Productivity and innovation are racing ahead, and legacy
security tools are struggling to keep up.

1Password invites you to a panel on December 2nd, with CISOs from
Oracle Red Bull Racing, Headway, and Brex [4]. Together, they'll share
how they're tackling the new era of access risk. Registrants will hear
practical, real-world strategies to govern AI use, manage SaaS sprawl,
and extend access security beyond the limits of SSO.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PUBLIC GITLAB REPOSITORIES EXPOSED MORE THAN 17,000 SECRETS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Security researcher Luke Marshall examined all 5.6 million public
GitLab Cloud repositories with TruffleHog and found 17,430 verified
active secrets across 2,804 distinct domains. This exposure is nearly
three times that found in a similar scan of Bitbucket. The leaked
credentials included over 5,200 Google Cloud Platform keys, MongoDB
credentials, Telegram bot tokens, and OpenAI keys. Some secrets date
back to 2009 and are still valid today. Although many organizations
revoked their credentials after receiving automated alerts—earning
the researcher $9,000 in bug bounties—some secrets continue to be
exposed on GitLab repositories. 

 UPBIT ADMITS SECURITY FLAW THAT COULD HAVE ALLOWED ATTACKERS TO INFER
PRIVATE KEYS AFTER $30M HACK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 South Korean crypto exchange Upbit suffered a $30 million breach on
November 27 when attackers drained assets from a Solana hot wallet.
North Korea's Lazarus Group is suspected of being the threat actor.
Post-incident analysis revealed a critical vulnerability that allowed
inference of a private key from publicly disclosed blockchain wallet
transactions, though Upbit's CEO did not explicitly confirm that this
flaw enabled the breach. The exchange has suspended deposits and
withdrawals for a complete wallet system overhaul and will cover all
customer losses using company assets. $1.5 million of the stolen funds
have already been frozen. 

 NEW ALBIRIOX MALWARE ATTACKING ANDROID USERS TO TAKE COMPLETE CONTROL
OF THEIR DEVICE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new Malware-as-a-Service called Albiriox has been observed
providing customers with remote access to victim Android devices.
Victims typically receive messages promising them discounts or prizes
for an app. The links lead to fake versions of legitimate apps that
request permissions to install applications, then fetch and install
the malware. In addition to traditional infostealer capabilities,
Albiriox includes a VNC module that streams the victim's device screen
to the attacker.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INSIDE VALKYRIE STEALER: CAPABILITIES, EVASION TECHNIQUES, AND
OPERATOR PROFILE (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Valkyrie Stealer is a C++ infostealer developed by threat actor
"Lawxsz" that employs Themida protection, ChaCha20-encrypted payload
with reflective DLL loading, and comprehensive anti-VM defenses. The
malware targets Chromium browsers by extracting AES master keys and
parsing SQLite databases using an embedded engine, steals Discord and
Telegram sessions, harvests credentials from 20+ gaming platforms, and
exfiltrates cryptocurrency wallets from MetaMask, Exodus, Atomic
Wallet, and Electrum. Stolen data is compressed using dual-method ZIP
packaging, encrypted with AES-GCM using hardcoded keys, and
exfiltrated to C2 servers resolved dynamically via Steam profile
scraping. The operator maintains active distribution channels on
Telegram, GitHub, YouTube, Discord, and Signal under the Prysmax
Software brand. 

 CACHE POISONING CASE STUDIES PART 1: FOUNDATIONAL ATTACKS BEHIND A
$100K+ VULNERABILITY CLASS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cache poisoning is a web security vulnerability in which attackers
trick caching systems, such as CDNs or proxies, into storing malicious
responses, serving them to other users, and causing widespread harm.
Early real-world examples from platforms such as HackerOne, GitHub,
and Shopify show that unvalidated headers like X-Forwarded-Host or
Content-Type can trigger global redirects, denial-of-service attacks,
or stored XSS across multiple domains. These foundational cases, often
yielding bounties of $2,500 to $6,300, highlight risks such as method
overrides in cloud storage and social media amplification via Open
Graph tags.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PAM WITHOUT VAULTS (SPONSOR) [10] 

 If engineer access to resources means passwords, vaults, or tickets,
your PAM is slowing you down. Teleport [11] removes access blockers by
replacing vaulted credentials and ticket queues with short-lived,
cryptographic identity and ephemeral authorization. No more standing
privileges, access friction, or credential handling. Try Teleport for
yourself. [11] 

 LUMEN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 LUMEN is a browser-based Windows Event Log analyzer built with React
and WebAssembly that processes EVTX files entirely client-side without
uploading logs to external servers. It supports files up to 500MB with
both binary EVTX and XML exports. The tool features a curated SIGMA
detection engine with platform-specific rule loading, automated event
correlation that chains related activities into investigative
storylines, IOC extraction with optional VirusTotal integration, and
AI-powered analysis. Security teams can perform guided investigations
while maintaining complete data privacy through local-only processing
with session persistence via localStorage and no telemetry or data
transmission. 

 PROXIMITY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Proximity scans MCP servers to discover tools, prompts, and
resources. It provides a detailed analysis of server capabilities and
optional security evaluation using NOVA rules. 

 GMSGADGET (WEBAPP) [14] 

 Give Me a Security Gadget (GMSGadget) is a collection of JavaScript
gadgets that can be used to bypass XSS mitigations like Content
Security Policy (CSP) and HTML sanitizers like DOMPurify.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HASHJACK ATTACK USES URL '#' TO CONTROL AI BROWSER BEHAVIOR (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 HashJack is a novel indirect prompt injection technique that embeds
malicious commands in URL fragments (after the # symbol) to manipulate
AI browser assistants such as Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and
Perplexity Comet. The attack takes advantage of AI assistants'
handling of full URLs, letting threat actors weaponize legitimate
websites without compromising them and execute malicious instructions
that bypass traditional security controls, enabling credential theft,
data exfiltration, and more. Microsoft and Perplexity updated their
products by October-November, but Google considered the Gemini
vulnerability as expected behavior and chose not to fix it, leaving
users vulnerable to this emerging AI security threat. 

 BRIT TELCO BRSK CONFIRMS BREACH AS BIDDING BEGINS FOR 230K+ CUSTOMER
RECORDS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Brsk, a UK broadband provider, is investigating a cyberattack after
criminals advertised more than 230,000 customer records for sale,
allegedly including contact details, installation data, location
information, phone numbers, and flags for vulnerable customers. It
says only basic contact data was accessed. No passwords or payment
details were taken. The company is offering affected users 12 months
of credit monitoring while regulators and law enforcement investigate.


 LEGACY PYTHON BOOTSTRAP SCRIPTS CREATE DOMAIN-TAKEOVER RISK IN
MULTIPLE PYPI PACKAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Old Python bootstrap scripts in several PyPI packages still reference
a long-abandoned domain used to fetch an installer for the legacy
Distribute fork of Setuptools. The domain is now for sale. An attacker
could buy it and serve malicious code to anyone running those scripts,
exposing developers to supply-chain compromise and potential remote
takeover via additional malware, such as RATs.
