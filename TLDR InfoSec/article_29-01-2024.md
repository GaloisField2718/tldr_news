ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ANTHROPIC CONFIRMS IT SUFFERED A DATA LEAK (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Anthropic disclosed a data breach after a contractor accidentally
sent customer info to a third party. The breach impacted names and
account balances. It was caused by human error, not a system breach
per Anthropic. The news came right before the FTC announced its
investigation into Anthropic's partnerships with Amazon and Google.
Anthropic says the incidents are unrelated. 

 AKIRA RANSOMWARE INFILTRATES UK-BASED LUSH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Akira ransomware group claims it breached Lush and secured 110GB of
data. It is threatening to publish the data since negotiations have
apparently failed. Passport scans were likely accessed, as well as
financial, accounting, tax, project, and client docs. This incident
demonstrates that Akira is a dangerous and flexible new threat that is
able to hit major corporations. 

 NEW CHERRYLOADER MALWARE MIMICS CHERRYTREE TO DEPLOY PRIVESC EXPLOITS
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Security researchers have discovered a new Golang-based malware
loader called CherryLoader that mimics the icon and name of the
CherryTree note-taking app to deceive users into installing it. Once
installed, it drops either the JuicyPotatoNG or PrintSpoofer exploit
and then runs a batch script to establish persistence. This article
contains indicators of compromise.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 I‚ÄôM NOT A PENTESTER (AND YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE ONE EITHER) (11
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post dives into how the author went from wanting to work in
infosec to deciding to pause and rethink what they actually wanted to
do. You don't need to be an expert to enjoy learning about security.
Working in security full-time isn't as exciting as it sounds. You can
still explore security concepts without making a career out of it. 

 CYBERSECURITY AS RELATABLE AS POSSIBLE (#4)‚Äî HACKERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Hackers blur the lines between heroes and villains in the digital
landscape. Though some are outlaws, others pioneer new possibilities.
This post looks at the various types of hackers and their motives.
Famous hackers have shaped the digital world through both ethical and
illegal means. Hackers fundamentally think differently and use tools
in unintended ways that can build up or tear down. 

 HOW WE DISCOVERED OVER 18,000 API SECRET TOKENS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Escape team underwent a project to spider 189.5M URLs to search
for API keys and discovered 18,000 secrets, which included $20M in
vulnerable Stripe tokens. This post covers how the team built a custom
web spider using Golang and fasthttp along with the data analysis and
verification pipeline. The process was deployed on a k8s cluster that
could scale to 150 concurrent worker instances. The data collection
took over 69 hours.

network equipment. It is based entirely on network traffic analysis,
so it does not make any noise on the air. Above is completely based on
the Scapy library. 

 SECOBSERVE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 SecObserve is an open source vulnerability management system for
software development teams that supports a variety of open source
vulnerability scanners. It integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines.

 HOW LEAST PRIVILEGE LEADS TO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY (12 MINUTE
READ) [18]

sufficient or productive in all cases. 

 A RECIPE FOR SCALING SECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A post from the Google Security team on creating large-scale security
changes. It begins by detailing some scalability issues in the
