STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HACKERS CAN READ PRIVATE AI-ASSISTANT CHATS EVEN THOUGH THEY‚ÄôRE
ENCRYPTED (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered a new side-channel attack called token
inference that can be used to infer the topic behind 55% of chats
between an AI assistant and users on all platforms other than Gemini.
The attack makes use of the fact that most AI Assistants send messages
back token by token to provide faster responses. The encrypted token
length is identical to the token length so the researchers were able
to train two LLMs based on stylistic patterns in public chats from the
various AI Assistants.

addresses specific use cases like encryption in transit, firmware
signatures, software signatures, public key infrastructure, tokens,
and other scenarios vulnerable to quantum threats.
