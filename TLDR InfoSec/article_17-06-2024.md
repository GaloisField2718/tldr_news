 DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS OF VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article explores some common misconceptions about vulnerability
management and sheds light on why these make vulnerability management
for open source software incredibly complex. It begins by discussing
the difference between MITRE's position as secretariat of the CVE
program vs the NVD's catalog before addressing why many CVEs that may
have exploits available don't make it to CISA's KEV list. The article
explains how EPSS scores work and how open source maintainers often
skip reporting CVEs and instead only report to the GitHub Advisory
Database, complicating matters. 

 ASSUMED BREACH: THE EVOLUTION OF OFFENSIVE SECURITY TESTING (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 TrustedSec elaborates on its new approach to red teaming and
pentesting, which focuses on scenario-based breaches, as opposed to
traditional internal pen tests, which focus mostly on physical
intrusion-based scenarios whereby attackers plant a rogue device in
the network. TrustedSec tests seven scenarios: SSO compromise, network
pivot, endpoint compromise, perimeter compromise, DevOps, workstation
compromise, and physical intrusion. The post includes a detailed
description of the scenarios and testing methods.
