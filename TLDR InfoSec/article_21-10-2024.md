 SECRETS AND SHADOWS: LEVERAGING BIG DATA FOR VULNERABILITY DISCOVERY
AT SCALE (36 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bill Demirkapi's long term project discovered over 66,000 unique TLDs
with dangling records and more than 15,000 verified secrets. He used
innovative methods including enumerating cloud IP pools, utilizing
passive DNS sources, and employing VirusTotal's Retrohunt tool with
custom YARA rules. In this post Demirkapi outlines the key principles
for large-scale vulnerability discovery, emphasizing starting with the
vulnerability itself and using creative data sources with relevant
relationships. 

 BUILD YOUR OWN AUTOFIX WITH PATCHWORK (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post describes a Patchflow to create an AI code autofixer. The
Patchflow first scans the code using Semgrep. It then enriches the
Sarif output with the source code file and uses an LLM to triage the
report. The LLM is then prompted to create and test a patch. If
successful, the LLM then opens a PR with the fix. Prompts for each of
the LLM steps are included. 

 CALL STACK SPOOFING EXPLAINED USING APT41 MALWARE (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Call stack spoofing is a technique to hide suspicious activity from
security software like EDR by mimicking a legitimate call stack. A
malware called DodgeBox used by APT41 implemented this technique to
trick antivirus software. By creating a fake call stack, the malware
obscures the true origin of function calls, making detection more
challenging.

 TURNING AWS DOCUMENTATION INTO GOLD: AI-ASSISTED SECURITY RESEARCH (8
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This researcher attempted to discover security vulnerabilities by
scraping and querying the AWS documentation. Their post begins by
briefly touching on the steps taken to scrape the AWS documentation
and some brief exploration locally using ripgrep. The researcher
uploaded the scraped and enriched docs to s3 and set up Amazon Bedrock
to query the docs using Claude 3.5. They discovered over a hundred
publicly accessible buckets with sensitive information, was able to
takeover a bucket, and discovered that the amzn-s3-demo-* prefix is
reserved. 

 HOW TO LEVERAGE $200 MILLION FCC PROGRAM BOOSTING K-12 CYBERSECURITY
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post provides cybersecurity professionals with insights into how
to leverage FCC's $200 million program to help K-12 schools improve
cybersecurity defenses. Schools can apply for funding by demonstrating
cybersecurity needs and developing improvement plans. Partnering with
cybersecurity experts can enhance schools' chances of securing funding
and maintaining long-term security. 

 OWASP SAYS SECRETS SECURITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR MOBILE
APPLICATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OWASP updated its Top 10 Risks for Mobile Applications, highlighting
"Improper Credential Usage" as a significant security concern due to
hardcoded secrets in mobile apps. To enhance secrets security,
developers should avoid hardcoding secrets, use secure storage APIs,
move secrets to the backend, rotate keys regularly, and implement
secrets detection tools like GitGuardian. Leaked secrets can lead to
severe consequences, such as unauthorized access, financial losses,
and legal repercussions, showing the importance of prioritizing
secrets management in mobile app development.
