ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STUDENT DATA STOLEN BY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED
HACKER (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A politically motivated hacker recently breached Columbia
University's systems, locking students out of their coursework, email
accounts, and video conferencing services. The hacker also stole
around 460GB of data, some of which they provided to Bloomberg to
showcase that the university employed discriminatory admissions
practices. The data includes the Social Security Numbers of students,
faculty, staff, applicants, and their families, as well as university
ID numbers, citizenship status, admissions decisions, and the program
to which they applied. 

 EU BORDER SYSTEM HAS THOUSANDS OF CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Thousands of vulnerabilities were discovered in the Schengen
Information System II (SIS II), which is used by EU border agencies to
track illegal migrants and suspected criminals. An audit by the
European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) found that the system
contained an excessive amount of accounts with administrative
privileges, was vulnerable to hacker overload and unauthorized access,
and that 69 external employees had access without proper clearance.
The EDPS found no evidence of a breach but warned that a breach could
be catastrophic. 

 CMS NOTIFIES 103K MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ABOUT UNAUTHORIZED ACCOUNT
CREATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was recently
alerted that Medicare.gov accounts had been created for 103K
individuals without their knowledge. The investigation determined that
the accounts were created using information gathered from external
sources. The unknown threat actor could use their access to view the
user's Medicare beneficiary ID, coverage start date, birth date, and
zip code.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE GPS LEAK NO ONE TALKED ABOUT: UFFIZIO'S SILENT EXPOSURE (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 DeepSpecter exposed a five-year data breach involving Uffizio's GPS
fleet management platform, leaking sensitive data from police,
ambulances, and critical infrastructure across 12 countries. Despite
claims of GDPR compliance and CVE disclosure, the exposure persisted
through global resellers, underscoring that regulatory compliance
alone does not provide adequate security protection. 

 ROLES HERE? ROLES THERE? ROLES ANYWHERE: EXPLORING THE SECURITY OF
AWS IAM ROLES ANYWHERE (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS IAM Roles Anywhere is a method for authenticating to AWS using
certificates signed by a configured trust anchor. By default, the
Roles Anywhere policy does not include any conditions, and any role
attached to it could be assumed by any request signed by any trust
anchor in that region. Unit 42 recommends specifying an ARN using
conditions in the default policy, utilizing ACM-PCA for the trust
anchor, and adhering to the principle of least privilege. 

 HIJACKING AMAZON EVENTBRIDGE FOR LAUNCHING CROSS-ACCOUNT ATTACKS (14
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers exploit AWS EventBridge's cross-account features using six
MITRE ATT&CK attack patterns: establishing persistent backdoors via
check-in events, creating bidirectional command and control channels,
conducting reconnaissance by capturing all events, exfiltrating data
in small chunks disguised as telemetry, lateral movement exploiting
trust relationships, and exploiting vulnerable Lambda functions for
unintended AWS API calls. These bypass traditional controls and evade
detection because EventBridge PutEvents API calls aren't logged in
CloudTrail. Defenses include Service Control Policies, specific event
patterns, input validation, and monitoring CloudWatch for unusual
activities.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FORTRA'S UNIQUE APPROACH TO DSPM (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Cloud data protection is messier than ever, and most DSPM tools are
just throwing more alerts without giving you an actionable way to
address risks. Learn how Fortra [11] can protect your organization's
sensitive data thanks to its unique architecture, which combines data
protection (DLP, network access) with discovery and classification.

 REPOAUDIT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 RepoAudit is a repo-level bug detector for general bugs. Currently,
it supports the detection of diverse bug types (such as Null Pointer
Dereference, Memory Leak, and Use After Free) in multiple programming
languages (including C/C++, Java, Python, and Go). 

 OBJECTIVE-C HELPER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An IDA plugin that helps decompile Objective-C code by removing
superfluous runtime calls related to ARC. 

 CARACAL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Caracal is a Rust-based implementation of eBPF techniques. It can
hide target BPF programs and maps, making them invisible to tools like
bpftop and bpftool. Additionally, it can conceal processes, rendering
them undetectable by commands such as ps, top, and ls /proc, and is
resistant to certain brute-force methods for uncovering them.

 Identity-based cyberattacks increased 156% due to advanced phishing
kits such as Tycoon 2FA and info-stealing malware.
Phishing-as-a-service platforms, which cost $200-$300 monthly, make
sophisticated attacks accessible, now comprising 59% of security
investigations, often resulting in business email compromise (BEC) and
ransomware. 

 POLICE IN BRAZIL ARREST A SUSPECT OVER $100M BANKING HACK (2 MINUTE

million in assets and are pursuing four more suspects.
