ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW UEFI SECURE BOOT FLAW EXPOSES SYSTEMS TO BOOTKITS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 A new UEFI Secure Boot vulnerability in a Microsoft-signed
application could allow for deploying bootkits. The vulnerable
application does not use trusted services to load the binaries but
instead manually decrypts and loads binaries into memory which could
be exploited by an attacker that replaces the expected binary with a
malicious one. ESET provides Powershell commands to check for
vulnerable systems.
