ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OPENAI API USER DATA EXPOSED IN MIXPANEL BREACH, CHATGPT UNAFFECTED
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A breach of Mixpanel's analytics platform exposed OpenAI API user
metadata, including names, emails, location data, internal user/org
IDs, and browser information. No passwords, API keys, chat logs, or
payment data were compromised, and ChatGPT users were unaffected.
OpenAI immediately removed Mixpanel from production and notified
impacted users. It is conducting a broader vendor security audit. This
incident highlights third-party vendor risk. Organizations should
inventory analytics tools that receive user data, enforce data
minimization policies with vendors, have API users enable MFA, and
monitor for targeted phishing using the exposed metadata. 

 ASAHI SAYS CROOKS STOLE DATA OF APPROXIMATELY 2M CUSTOMERS AND
EMPLOYEES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ransomware operators hit the Asahi Group in late September, crippling
Japanese operations and exposing data on around 2 million people,
including customers, employees, and their families. Personal
information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, birth
dates, and gender was accessed, but no credit card data was involved. 

 GAINSIGHT CEO DOWNPLAYS IMPACT OF ATTACK THAT SPREAD TO SALESFORCE
ENVIRONMENTS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Gainsight is investigating a breach involving its
Salesforce-connected app, working with Mandiant and relying heavily on
Salesforce logs to understand which customers were affected and how
attackers used compromised OAuth tokens. The company insists that only
a small number of customers saw data impact. Google Threat
Intelligence has flagged hundreds of potentially affected Salesforce
instances.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT HUNTING VS. THREAT INTELLIGENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Threat intelligence focuses on understanding the external threat
landscape, while threat hunting proactively investigates internal
systems for threats that have evaded automated defenses through
hypothesis-driven analysis and behavioral anomaly detection. The two
functions create a feedback loop: intelligence provides IOCs, TTPs,
and focus areas to guide hunting hypotheses, while hunting discoveries
enrich intelligence with validated internal findings. Security teams
should integrate both by using threat intelligence to prioritize
hunting efforts via MITRE ATT&CK TTP mapping, embedding intelligence
feeds into SIEM/EDR for automated IOC correlation, and establishing
workflows that link hunting results to strategic and tactical
intelligence products. 

 THE MINEFIELD BETWEEN SYNTAXES: EXPLOITING SYNTAX CONFUSIONS IN THE
WILD (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Syntax confusion arises when different components, such as browsers,
proxies, frameworks, or libraries, parse the same input in conflicting
ways, letting attackers bypass filters or change behaviour. By abusing
alternate syntaxes, an attacker can slip dangerous characters or paths
past validation and turn limited issues like SSRF or cache quirks into
powerful primitives such as stored XSS or arbitrary file access.

 INSIDE THE GITHUB INFRASTRUCTURE POWERING NORTH KOREA'S CONTAGIOUS
INTERVIEW NPM ATTACKS (21 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Socket Threat Research exposed North Korea's Contagious Interview
operation, which added 197 malicious npm packages since October, using
a GitHub-Vercel-npm delivery chain to distribute OtterCookie malware
targeting blockchain and Web3 developers through fake job interviews.
The malware performs comprehensive data theft. Security teams should
treat npm installs as remote code execution, implement network egress
controls on CI/CD systems, require code review for GitHub templates,
and deploy real-time package scanning to detect behaviors like
import-time loaders and eval on network responses before malware
executes. 

 REPORT NAMES TEEN IN SCATTERED LAPSUS$ HUNTERS, GROUP DENIES (11
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A 15-year-old in Jordan known as "Rey" was allegedly identified as a
key administrator of Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters after operational
security failures. The group, which merged tactics from Scattered
Spider, LAPSUS$, and ShinyHunters, conducted high-impact attacks
against Jaguar Land Rover, Schneider Electric, Telefonica, and other
major organizations using stolen Salesforce data, insider recruitment,
and ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware variants. The group vigorously denied
the allegations in a detailed Telegram response, offering 10 BTC to
anyone who could prove Rey's identity with evidence. Rey himself
claims he's been cooperating with law enforcement since June and is
attempting to exit the cybercrime community. 

 SCOTTISH COUNCIL STILL REBUILDING SYSTEMS TWO YEARS AFTER RANSOMWARE
ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A 2023 ransomware attack on Comhairle nan Eilean Siar forced the
Western Isles council to rebuild multiple core systems, leaving some
finance and revenue platforms still not fully restored two years
later. The incident has cost around £950,000, created large data gaps
and backlogs, and left staff under intense, prolonged pressure.
