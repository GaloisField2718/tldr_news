 WANT THE BLAME OR THE CONTROL? INFOSEC + CIAM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 50% of CISOs own customer identity. The other 50% say “that's
engineering's job.” 100% of CISOs get called to the floor when the
customer-facing app gets compromised. Frontegg [5] puts InfoSec in the
captain's chair without needing to become coders.👇

👮 Enforce. Apply advanced policies consistently across all apps,
like adaptive MFA.

👀 See. Monitor threat behaviors and bad actors through dashboards
and logs. 

 💪 Act. Block users or force additional verification steps, like
step-up auth.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 2M RECORDS EXPOSED BY A TECH RECRUITMENT SERVICE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A publicly exposed, unprotected database belonging to Alltech
Consulting Services containing 2M records of data belonging to over
200K job seekers was discovered. The records included salary
expectations, work experience information, internal notes, names,
email addresses, phone numbers, last four digits of SSNs, and passport
numbers. The finding was responsibly disclosed to Alltech Consulting
Services, which password-protected the database the following day. 

 AMAZON CONFIRMS EMPLOYEE DATA BREACH, BUT SAYS IT'S LIMITED TO
CONTACT INFO (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A breach at Amazon's property management vendor exposed work contact
details (emails, phone numbers, and locations) of potentially millions
of employees. The incident is linked to the 2023 MOVEit vulnerability,
which affected multiple organizations. 

 MILLIONS OF HOT TOPIC CUSTOMERS IMPACTED BY DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 A massive data breach at Hot Topic exposed nearly 57 million
customers' personal information, including emails, names, addresses,
and partial credit card data. A hacker, who allegedly accessed data
through an employee's compromised computer and unprotected Snowflake
account, has demanded $100,000 from Hot Topic.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EVASIVE ZIP CONCATENATION: TROJAN TARGETS WINDOWS USERS (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Zip Concatenation is where a threat actor concatenates the binary
data of two zip files to attempt to hide the malicious content. An
attacker creates two zip files - one that contains a benign document
and another that contains malware - and then concatenates the two zip
files. The attacker then relies upon the victim and any relevant
cybersecurity tools only seeing one of the archives and missing the
malicious files. This post breaks down a real-world campaign that used
zip concatenation to hide a Trojan in a second archive and shows how
7zip would miss the file but Windows Explorer and Winrar would not. 

 OPEN SOURCE SECURITY INCIDENTS AREN'T GOING AWAY (7 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Open source code is used in 95% of all software, making security
crucial. While technical skills matter, soft skills like communication
and collaboration are most vital for open source security developers.
It is still very important to invest in open source security. 

 GOISSUE – THE TOOL BEHIND RECENT GITHUB PHISHING ATTACKS (7 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 A new phishing tool called GoIssue, which sells for $700-$3,000,
enables attackers to harvest GitHub users' email addresses and send
mass phishing emails. The tool poses significant risks as it targets
developers' credentials, potentially enabling supply chain attacks and
corporate network breaches.

 SNOWFLAKE HACKERS IDENTIFIED AND CHARGED WITH STEALING 50 BILLION
AT&T RECORDS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Two hackers, Connor Moucka and John Binns, have been accused by the
US government of stealing approximately 50 billion AT&T customer call
and text records. The breach, which occurred in April 2023, affected
nearly all of AT&T's customers. The stolen data included call and
message metadata. 

 COMPARING STATIC AND RUNTIME REACHABILITY (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article compares static and runtime reachability, two emerging
approaches to determining whether vulnerabilities in code dependencies
are actually exploitable. Both offer package-level and function-level
capabilities. Static reachability analyzes code repositories to
identify potential vulnerabilities during development but can't
eliminate false positives completely, while runtime reachability uses
agents to monitor actual code execution and provide near-certain
identification of exploitable vulnerabilities. Static reachability
integrates well with development workflows and doesn't require agent
deployment. Runtime reachability offers superior accuracy in
identifying truly exploitable vulnerabilities but requires agent
installation and currently has limited vendor support. 

 NORTH KOREAN HACKERS CREATE FLUTTER APPS TO BYPASS MACOS SECURITY (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 North Korean hackers created malicious Flutter apps for macOS,
passing Apple's security checks with legitimate developer IDs. These
apps connect to DPRK servers and have the ability to execute scripts
from a command and control server. Apple has revoked the signatures of
these apps to prevent them from bypassing security measures on macOS
systems.
