 AI-POWERED RISK MANAGEMENT - JOIN THE VIRTUAL EVENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 In 2025, risk is decentralized. It's spreading across vendors,
systems, and applications - and threatening to overwhelm GRC teams.

Join the virtual event Sept 10 [4] to learn from LARKIN RYDER (HEAD OF
COMPLIANCE AT ANTHROPIC) and JEREMY CARRIGER (CISO AT ARCADIA),
alongside JADEE HANSON (CISO AT VANTA) and JEREMY EPLING (CPO AT
VANTA). They'll talk AI, automation, and new ways to manage risk [4]:

Learn how to:

 	* Proactively manage and centralize risk.
 	* Save time by automatically flagging gaps in evidence
 	* Reduce manual work with AI-powered policy drafts and bulk updates
 	* Stay secure with continuous monitoring
 	* Work faster with Slack integrations

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SILVER FOX APT EXPLOITS SIGNED WINDOWS DRIVER TO DELIVER VALLEYRAT (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Silver Fox APT exploits a Microsoft-signed but vulnerable WatchDog
Antimalware driver (amsdk.sys v1.0.600) to disable security processes
on Windows 10/11 and deploy ValleyRAT malware, with the driver never
being flagged by Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist or LOLDrivers
database. The attackers bypassed hash-based blocklists even after a
patch by changing a byte in the driver's timestamp while keeping its
valid Microsoft signature, showing how trusted signed drivers can be
weaponized. The campaign exposes gaps in Microsoft's driver blocklist
and the need for security teams to use additional verification beyond
signature validation, as the malware terminated nearly 200 security
processes targeting mainly Asian organizations. 

 WORDPRESS WOES CONTINUE AMID CLICKFIX, TDS THREATS (5 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Cybercriminals are exploiting vulnerable and fake WordPress plugins
to hijack sites and redirect visitors to malicious destinations. Two
major campaigns, ClickFix ("ShadowCaptcha") and Help TDS, have
targeted thousands of websites for scams and data theft. Attackers
often gain access through stolen credentials or unpatched plugins,
making regular updates, strong authentication, and vigilant plugin
management critical for site security. 

 IRANIAN HACKERS EXPLOIT 100+ EMBASSY EMAIL ACCOUNTS IN GLOBAL
PHISHING TARGETING DIPLOMATS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An Iran-linked hacking group executed a broad spear-phishing
campaign, compromising over 100 embassy and government accounts
worldwide. Masquerading as urgent diplomatic emails, attackers
distributed malware using Word documents with malicious macros. The
operation, associated with the group Homeland Justice, mainly targeted
Europe and Africa.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AGENTIC AI: A CISO'S SECURITY NIGHTMARE IN THE MAKING? (8 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Agentic AI's autonomous decision-making poses cybersecurity risks,
including shadow AI deployments without IT oversight, multi-agent
systems spreading sensitive data, and AI chaining actions that mimic
multi-stage attacks while evading security controls. CISOs struggle
with visibility into these systems, increased attack surfaces via
third-party APIs, and distinguishing between emergent AI behavior and
security breaches. This calls for new defense models with real-time
monitoring, tight governance, and cross-team coordination.
Organizations must adopt secure-by-design methods and proactive
governance to maximize AI benefits while managing risks from systems
that can access data, decide, and adapt without human oversight. 

 HOW THEY GOT IN — DAVITA INC. (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The data breach at DaVita Inc. unfolded due to a combination of weak
security controls, persistent vulnerabilities, and a lack of timely
action on previous advisories. Attackers exploited leaked credentials,
unpatched internet-facing systems, legacy software, and insufficient
monitoring, allowing them to compromise sensitive healthcare data. The
repercussions were serious: DaVita's stock value plunged over 14%,
substantial regulatory fines are expected, and the company's
reputation took a significant hit. 

 AZURE AD CLIENT SECRET LEAK: THE KEYS TO CLOUD (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Exposing Azure AD credentials in public configuration files (like
appsettings.json) gives attackers direct access to cloud resources
because with these secrets, attackers can impersonate trusted apps,
exfiltrate data, escalate privileges, and persist within an
organization. Leaks occur due to misconfiguration, poor secrets
management, and insufficient security checks. To prevent this,
restrict access, move secrets out of code, rotate exposed keys
immediately, use least privilege, and monitor for misuse to prevent
severe breaches.

 PROLIFIC RUSSIAN RANSOMWARE OPERATOR LIVING IN CALIFORNIA ENJOYS RARE
LENIENCY AWAITING TRIAL (11 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Russian national Ianis Antropenko, arrested for deploying Zeppelin
ransomware against 138 U.S. victims, including critical
infrastructure, from 2018 to 2022, remains free on bail in California
despite multiple parole violations and $2.8M in seized
cryptocurrency—a rare leniency that security experts suggest may
indicate cooperation with authorities. His poor operational security,
including using personal PayPal accounts linked to ransomware
operations and storing cryptocurrency seed phrases in iCloud, enabled
FBI investigators to trace over 101 Bitcoins through the seized
ChipMixer service and build their case. The case highlights the
evolving challenge of prosecuting cybercriminals operating from within
U.S. borders, with Antropenko's lenient pretrial conditions (including
no ban on internet use) contrasting sharply with the typical detention
of ransomware suspects, raising questions about potential cooperation
agreements or intelligence value. 

 INLINE STYLE EXFILTRATION: LEAKING DATA WITH CHAINED CSS CONDITIONALS
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Attackers can now use only inline CSS styles—with the help of
chained if statements—to steal sensitive data like user IDs directly
from web pages, all without external files or selectors. This creative
trick works on Chromium browsers and highlights how inline CSS itself
can be a security threat if user-controlled content isn't locked down
properly. 

 FIRE ANT: A DEEP-DIVE INTO HYPERVISOR-LEVEL ESPIONAGE (18 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Cybersecurity firm Sygnia has been tracking a campaign targeting
VMware ESXi, vCenter, and network appliances to compromise
environments. The attackers compromise the hypervisor by exploiting
CVE-2023-34048 to obtain code execution and install an HTTP backdoor
on the hypervisors. The attackers then used PowerCLI commands to
compromise guests without guest credentials and also ran unregistered
VMs with the VMware CLI to bypass registration in vCenter.
