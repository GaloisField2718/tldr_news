 ATTACK PATHS DON'T PAUSE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Misconfigurations and excessive privileges quietly chain together
into routes attackers can use to reach your critical assets — and
they don't wait. Attack Path Management (APM) shows identity risk the
way adversaries see it, mapping relationships across identities,
systems, and permissions so you can prioritize what truly matters.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SIX JAVASCRIPT ZERO-DAY BUGS LEAD TO FEARS OF SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers from Koi discovered six zero-day vulnerabilities dubbed
"PackageGate" across four major JavaScript package managers (npm,
pnpm, vlt, and Bun) that bypass protections against script execution
and lockfile integrity designed to prevent malicious code from running
automatically. While pnpm, vlt, and Bun patched the flaws, npm (now
owned by Microsoft) declined to fix the vulnerabilities, stating that
the behavior "works as expected," leaving gaps in defenses adopted
after the Shai-Hulud supply chain attack that affected over 25,000
repositories. The bypasses vary by tool—npm's weakness lies in Git
dependencies with malicious .npmrc files, pnpm and vlt have lockfile
gaps enabling tarball swapping, vlt has a tar extraction path
traversal flaw, and Bun's trust allowlist can be spoofed—raising
concerns about potential install-time code execution at scale even in
hardened environments. 

 CRITICAL GRIST-CORE VULNERABILITY ALLOWS RCE ATTACKS VIA SPREADSHEET
FORMULAS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CVE-2026-24002 (CVSS 9.1) is a critical Pyodide sandbox escape
vulnerability dubbed "Cellbreak" in Grist-Core that allows attackers
to execute arbitrary OS commands or host-runtime JavaScript through
malicious spreadsheet formulas. The flaw stems from Grist's
blocklist-style sandbox approach that permits traversal through
Python's class hierarchy and leaves ctypes available, enabling
attackers to access database credentials, API keys, and sensitive
files while creating lateral movement opportunities. The vulnerability
was patched in version 1.7.9, released January 9, with users advised
to update immediately or temporarily mitigate by setting
GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR to "gvisor," while avoiding the
GRIST_PYODIDE_SKIP_DENO flag that reintroduces the risk. 

 NEW SANDBOX ESCAPE FLAW EXPOSES N8N INSTANCES TO RCE ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from JFrog discovered two new vulnerabilities in the n8n
workflow automation platform that could allow for RCE, one of which
received a CVSS score of 9.9. The two vulnerabilities are AST sandbox
escapes in both Python and JavaScript sandboxes that could allow for
arbitrary code execution on the underlying nodes. The vulnerability
has been fixed in the n8n cloud platform, but users running
self-hosted versions should update to fix it.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE EVOLUTION OF FIDO EXPERIENCES ON ANDROID (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google detailed Android's evolution from password-based
authentication to FIDO2 passkeys, starting with Universal Second
Factor (U2F) in 2014 as a phishing-resistant second factor and
advancing to passwordless passkeys built on WebAuthn and CTAP2
standards that use device biometrics, PINs, or patterns for
authentication. Android announced FIDO2 specifications over USB with
PIN support in November 2023, featuring streamlined user experiences
with Material3 Design bottomsheets, Credential Manager APIs for easier
developer integration, and secure PIN protocol algorithms that avoid
storing actual PINs on devices or security keys. Google plans
continued FIDO enhancements, including NFC support, native credential
management for physical security keys, and post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms to ensure passkey security remains robust against emerging
threats like quantum computers. 

 ON THE COMING INDUSTRIALIZATION OF EXPLOIT GENERATION WITH LLMS (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The author of this post discovered a novel zero-day in QuickJS using
Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2. They set up a testbed in which the agents were
tasked with achieving different objectives across systems with varying
protections. The author succeeded in generating over 40 distinct
exploits, including complex exploit chains. Experiments such as this
demonstrate that tasks like exploit generation are increasingly
solvable by LLMs with enough tokens. 

 GENERAL GRABOIDS: WORMS AND REMOTE CODE EXECUTION IN COMMAND &
CONQUER (15 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Security researchers analyzed Command & Conquer: Generals' newly
released source code and uncovered three major multiplayer flaws: a
filename stack overflow, arbitrary file writes, and an out-of-bounds
write during packet fragmentation. By chaining these bugs, they
achieved reliable remote code execution, then built a self-spreading
worm that drops a malicious DLL, hooks legacy Windows socket APIs,
listens for “magic” packets or chat messages, executes OS
commands, and manipulates local game actions such as camera and UI
effects.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING IDE-SHEPHERD: YOUR SHIELD AGAINST THREAT ACTORS LURKING
IN YOUR IDE (16 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 IDE-SHEPHERD is a free open-source security extension for VS Code and
Cursor that addresses trust-based security model vulnerabilities by
integrating into the Node.js runtime of the extension host process.
The tool uses a require-in-the-middle layer to patch critical modules
like child_process, http, and https, enabling real-time interception
and blocking of malicious operations, including process execution,
network communications, and workspace task execution against a growing
ruleset. IDE-SHEPHERD provides granular per-extension behavior
analysis rather than publisher-based trust, includes heuristic
detection for suspicious extension metadata (wildcard activations,
obfuscation, and missing repository links), and offers optional
Datadog Agent integration for centralized monitoring while keeping all
data local by default. 

 A FIRST LOOK AT APERTURE BY TAILSCALE (PRIVATE ALPHA) (6 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Aperture is an alpha-stage AI gateway that offers insights into
coding agent usage within organizations. It eliminates the need to
share API keys by using Tailscale's built-in identity system for
authenticating users and machines. The tool supports CLI and VS
Code-based AI coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini
CLI, providing centralized monitoring of usage, cost tracking across
different models and providers, and SIEM integration via S3 exports,
all while linking API usage to specific users and devices. Aperture is
free for up to three users, similar to Tailscale's Personal plan. It

 VIBE-CODED 'SICARII' RANSOMWARE CAN'T BE DECRYPTED (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The Sicarii ransomware, which emerged as a RaaS offering in December,
contains a critical design flaw that makes decryption impossible even
if victims pay, as the malware regenerates new RSA key pairs locally
during each execution and discards the private key needed for
recovery. The ransomware's suspicious "Israeli/Jewish" branding with
Hebrew language and historical symbols appears to be a false flag,
given its primarily Russian-language operations and machine-translated
Hebrew content with errors. It was likely that inexperienced
developers used AI-assisted tooling to create the poorly coded
ransomware. Organizations affected are advised to abandon ransom
negotiations and focus on alternate recovery pathways, including
backups and incident response services. 

 TRUMP'S ACTING CYBERSECURITY CHIEF UPLOADED SENSITIVE GOVERNMENT DOCS
TO CHATGPT (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Acting CISA director Madhu Gottumukkala, a Trump appointee, uploaded
internal “for official use only” contracting documents to ChatGPT,
triggering federal security alerts and a DHS review of potential
damage. Officials had previously granted him a special exemption to
use ChatGPT, even as other staff were barred. His tenure has already
been controversial after an unsanctioned polygraph and suspensions of
career staff. 

 THERE'S A RASH OF SCAM SPAM COMING FROM A REAL MICROSOFT ADDRESS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A legitimate Microsoft Power BI email address is being abused to send
fake $399 billing alerts that push victims to call a number and
install remote-access tools, handing attackers control of their
computers. Scammers exploit Power BI's subscription feature so
messages come from a trusted Microsoft domain with no malicious links,
bypassing filters until Microsoft temporarily disabled the abused
feature.
