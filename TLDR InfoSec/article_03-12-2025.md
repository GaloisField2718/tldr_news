 THE $10 TOOL BEHIND MOST RANSOMWARE ATTACKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Before the ransomware hits, and much before the breach makes
headlines — there's usually an infostealer. These cheap, widely
available tools have become the #1 driver of identity-based attacks
[4]. They quietly harvest credentials that get sold, traded, and
weaponized downstream.

Billions of stolen credentials are already out there - and you need to
be proactive about protecting yours. Flashpoint's guide [4] covers:

→ Which infostealer strains dominate underground markets and how
they're deployed

→ How attackers turn stolen identities into ransomware, fraud, and
breaches

→ How to use your existing logs to spot compromised accounts before
attackers do

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 STEALTHY BROWSER EXTENSIONS WAITED YEARS BEFORE INFECTING 4.3M
CHROME, EDGE USERS WITH BACKDOORS AND SPYWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 ShadyPanda, a threat actor, compromised 4.3 million Chrome and Edge
users through a seven-year campaign that published legitimate
extensions, accumulated Featured and Verified status, and then
weaponized them via malicious updates containing backdoors and
spyware. The malware enabled complete browser surveillance, with
remote code execution capabilities, hourly C2 communication to a
server, arbitrary JavaScript execution with full browser API access,
and real-time exfiltration of browsing data. ShadyPanda exploited the
fundamental gap that allows marketplaces to review extensions only at
submission, rather than monitor post-approval updates. Five extensions
with over 4 million combined installs remain active on the Edge
marketplace. 

 FAKE CALENDLY INVITES SPOOF TOP BRANDS TO HIJACK AD MANAGER ACCOUNTS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There is an ongoing phishing campaign that uses Calendly to
impersonate popular brands to phish for business ad manager accounts.
These accounts are tempting for threat actors as they can be used as a
springboard to launch malvertising campaigns with advanced features
like geo-targeting, domain filtering, and device-specific targeting.
The victims receive a Calendly invite from the threat actor
impersonating a recruiter with a fake meeting invitation, which
directs the user to an Attacker-in-the-Middle phishing page that
attempts to steal login credentials. 

 NORTH KOREA LURES ENGINEERS TO RENT IDENTITIES IN FAKE IT WORKER
SCHEME (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 North Korea's Famous Chollima are running a campaign in which they
attempt to lure developers into renting their identities for illicit
fundraising. The attackers offer legitimate engineers a percentage of
the salary for a remote job if they grant the threat actor remote
access to their computer. In some cases, they act as a frontman for
the agent in interviews.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW A RUSSIAN THREAT ACTOR USES A RECENT WINRAR VULNERABILITY IN
THEIR UKRAINE OPERATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Primitive Bear (Gamaredon), an FSB-attributed APT group, exploited
CVE-2025-6218, a critical WinRAR path traversal vulnerability
affecting versions through 7.11, in targeted spear-phishing campaigns
against Ukrainian military units and government entities using
military-themed lures. The attack chain leveraged malicious RAR
archives containing HTA files with obfuscated VBScript, weaponizing a
path traversal flaw to write payloads directly to Windows Startup
folders, then used mshta.exe as a LOLBIN to fetch secondary-stage
malware from a DynDNS-based C2 infrastructure across 14 active
domains. The campaigns demonstrated sophisticated tradecraft,
including minimal obfuscation, multi-stage payload delivery, phishing
URL masquerading (president.gov.ua@malicious-domain), and
infrastructure leveraging InterLIR IP marketplaces and No-IP dynamic
DNS services. Defenders are recommended to update WinRAR to 7.12+,
block HTA execution via AppLocker/WDAC, and monitor LOLBIN abuse and
Startup folder modifications. 

 AWS SECRETS MANAGER ANNOUNCES MANAGED EXTERNAL SECRETS (1 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Managed external secrets is a new capability in AWS Secrets Manager
that allows automatic rotation for participating third-party SaaS
secrets without the overhead of rotation, Lambda function creation, or
management. At present, the supported third-party vendors are
Salesforce, BigID, and Snowflake. AWS has released a guide for
becoming an integrated third-party vendor. The guide demonstrates how
to create, manage, and view external secrets. 

 AI AGENTS FIND $4.6M IN BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACT EXPLOITS (16 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 SCONE-bench, created by Anthropic researchers, contains 405
exploit-prone smart contracts. Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5
exploited 34 contracts worth $4.6 million. Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 found
two new zero-day vulnerabilities in 2,849 new contracts, producing
exploits worth $3,694 at an API cost of $3,476 for GPT-5. This shows
that profitable autonomous exploitation is feasible with current
models. Security teams should adopt AI agents for smart contract
auditing before deployment, as the decreasing window for exploitation
and dropping costs ($1.22 per run) give attackers advantages, while
enabling proactive vulnerability detection and fixing.

 TELEGRAM'S COCOON NETWORK GOES LIVE, CHALLENGES AMAZON, MICROSOFT IN
AI COMPUTE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Telegram Cocoon is a TON blockchain-based decentralized AI compute
network that connects GPU providers (compensated in toncoin tokens)
with privacy-focused applications that require AI model execution. It
is positioned as a confidential alternative to centralized cloud
providers like Amazon and Microsoft. The network employs attested
compute layers to process AI requests while settling payments
on-chain. Security professionals should note ecosystem concerns,
including hardware limitations restricted to specific Intel
processors, potential scrutiny of the "100% confidentiality" claims,
and the strategic implications of a central messaging platform
controlling AI compute infrastructure that could process sensitive
organizational workloads. 

 VT-PY (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 vt-py is the official Python client library for VirusTotal. The
library allows for interacting with the VirusTotal REST API v3. 

 SAPORO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 Saporo provides a graph-native identity security platform that
analyzes relationships, events, and misconfigurations across
on‑prem, cloud, and machine identities to surface attack paths,
reduce exposure, and harden access to critical assets before
exploitation.

 GLASSWORM MALWARE RETURNS IN THIRD WAVE OF MALICIOUS VS CODE PACKAGES
(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Glassworm malware returned for a third wave on OpenVSX and Microsoft
Visual Studio marketplaces with 24 new packages impersonating popular
developer tools. The supply chain attack evolved to use Rust-based
implants alongside invisible Unicode character obfuscation, steals
GitHub, npm, and OpenVSX credentials plus cryptocurrency wallet data
from 49 extensions, deploys SOCKS proxies for traffic routing, and
installs HVNC clients for stealthy remote access while manipulating
download counts to boost search rankings. Development teams should
immediately audit installed VS Code extensions against published IOC
lists, verify publisher authenticity before installation, monitor for
suspicious extension updates, and implement controls to detect
invisible Unicode characters in code reviews to prevent credential
theft and environment compromise. 

 INDIA ORDERS SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO PRELOAD STATE-OWNED CYBER SAFETY
APP (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 India's telecoms ministry has privately asked smartphone makers to
preload all new devices with a state-owned cybersecurity app that
cannot be deleted. Smartphone makers will have 90 days to ensure the
government's Sanchar Saathi app is preinstalled on new devices and
should push the app to existing devices in the supply chain via
software updates. Apple is expected to push back on this requirement
and may come to a compromise in which it agrees to nudge users to
install the app. 

 VULNERABILITY IN OPENAI CODING AGENT COULD FACILITATE ATTACKS ON
DEVELOPERS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A command-injection vulnerability in OpenAI's Codex CLI allows
trusted local configuration files to execute attacker-controlled
commands without user approval. By slipping malicious configs into a
repository, an attacker could gain remote access, run arbitrary
commands, steal secrets, and even poison supply chains via CI and
build systems. OpenAI fixed the issue in Codex CLI version 0.23.0
after disclosure.
