TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-05-28

 PROTECTING HIGH-PROFILE INDIVIDUALS USING OSINT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Threats against high-profile individuals often start online — but
if they go unnoticed, they can escalate into real-world harassment or
even physical harm. This threat is growing more urgent at a time when:

→ Geopolitical tensions are putting corporate leaders in the
crosshairs,

→ AI-powered deepfakes are fueling a surge [4] in fraud and
reputational attacks, and

→ 36% of vulnerabilities had known public exploits, giving attackers
an easy way in.

In THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO OSINT FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION [4],
Flashpoint breaks down how security teams can identify these threats
though open source intelligence, and take preventive action before
threats escalate. Get the guide [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MATHWORKS, CREATOR OF MATLAB, CONFIRMS RANSOMWARE ATTACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 MathWorks, creator of MATLAB computing platform, disclosed a
ransomware attack that began May 18 that affected customer-facing
applications and internal systems. The company has been gradually
restoring services with cybersecurity experts' help and has notified
federal authorities, but it hasn't revealed which ransomware group was
responsible or whether data was stolen. 

 ADIDAS CONFIRMS CRIMINALS STOLE DATA FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE PROVIDER
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Adidas disclosed that an unauthorized person stole customer contact
information from a third-party customer service provider. The data
included names and email addresses of customers who previously
contacted support, but excluded passwords and payment information. The
company is notifying affected customers and authorities while
investigating the breach. 

 GITHUB MCP EXPLOITED: ACCESSING PRIVATE REPOSITORIES VIA MCP (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical vulnerability in GitHub's MCP integration allows attackers
to use prompt injection in public issues to trick coding agents (e.g.,
Claude) into leaking data from private repositories. This exploit,
termed a "toxic agent flow," does not rely on compromised tools but
exploits trusted agents' interactions with untrusted external content.
The issue requires system-level mitigations—like runtime guardrails
and continuous MCP traffic monitoring—since model-level alignment is
insufficient to prevent such context-driven attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT SPOTLIGHT: HIJACKED ROUTERS AND FAKE SEARCHES FUELING PAYROLL
HEIST (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ReliaQuest has discovered a campaign that uses SEO poisoning to
target employee mobile devices for payroll fraud. Attackers create
fake company login pages that appear in search results, steal
credentials when employees access them, and then redirect paychecks to
attacker-controlled accounts. This post dives into the campaign, the
attacks, and how they keep evading detection. 

 REDISRAIDER: WEAPONIZING MISCONFIGURED REDIS TO MINE CRYPTOCURRENCY
AT SCALE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 RedisRaider is a new Linux malware campaign that scans the internet
for public Redis servers running on Linux and then abuses the Redis
SET command to inject a cron job. The cron job downloads the
RedisRaider binary to /tmp/mysql, makes it executable, and then
executes it using nohup. The RedisRaider binary is a heavily
obfuscated dropper for a modified version of the XMRig cryptominer
that uses a custom packer to further complicate reversing and forensic
analysis. 

 MASTER TAILSCALE ACLS FOR YOUR ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENT: A STEP-BY-STEP

 FIREFOX SECURITY RESPONSE TO PWN2OWN 2025 (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Two new content-process exploits were demonstrated against Firefox at
Pwn2Own 2025, but neither bypassed the browser's sandbox. Mozilla
released patched versions the same day and urged users to update
immediately. These results reflect recent architectural hardening and
reinforce Firefox's security resilience. 

 THREAT OF TCC BYPASSES ON MACOS (17 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 macOS's TCC framework blocks unauthorized access to sensitive data,
even for malware with root access, but many third-party apps expose
vulnerabilities that bypass these protections. A flaw in Cursor.app
shows how malware can inherit TCC permissions and access protected
files without user knowledge. Developers and vendors often ignore
these issues, despite their real threat to user privacy and system
integrity.
