 TAKE CONTROL OF SAAS SPRAWL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 IT and security teams are trapped in a reactive mode when managing
SaaS and AI app sprawl. While accounting for an ever-growing number of
risks, admins are continually bogged down by manual processes and
disconnected workflows.

To tackle this problem, check out 1Password's on-demand webinar [4]
that explores how IT and security teams can:

 	* Gain visibility into unsanctioned apps.
 	* Get actionable insights into SaaS spend and licenses.
 	* Automate onboarding and offboarding processes.

Watch or download the webinar [4] to learn how to take a proactive
approach to SaaS management and save valuable time for your IT and
security teams.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 INSURANCE GIANT SAYS MOST US CUSTOMER DATA STOLEN IN CYBER-ATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers breached Allianz Life's third-party cloud-based CRM system on
July 16, using social engineering techniques to steal personal data
from approximately 1.4 million of the insurer's North American
customers. The German parent company immediately contained the breach,
notified the FBI, and confirmed no other company systems were
compromised. 

 DATING SAFETY APP TEA BREACHED, EXPOSING 72,000 USER IMAGES (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Tea, an app for anonymous dating reviews, suffered a data breach
exposing 72,000 images, including 13,000 verification selfies and IDs.
The breach affected users who signed up before February 2024. 4chan
users reportedly shared the stolen data, coinciding with Tea's surge
in viral popularity. 

 POST SMTP PLUGIN FLAW EXPOSES 200K WORDPRESS SITES TO HIJACKING
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-24000) in the Post SMTP
WordPress plugin allows low-privileged users to access email logs and
hijack administrator accounts by intercepting password reset emails.
The flaw affects all versions up to 3.2.0 and stems from broken access
controls that only checked if users were logged in without verifying
their permission levels. Despite a fix being released in version 3.3.0
on June 11, over 200,000 WordPress sites remain vulnerable, as more
than half of users haven't updated their plugin.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WE ROOTED COPILOT (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft's Copilot Enterprise Python sandbox vulnerability allowed
researchers to gain root access within the container through a PATH
hijacking attack in the keepAliveJupyterSvc.sh script, which executed
`pgrep` without a full path every 2 seconds. Researchers exploited
this by placing a malicious script in /app/miniconda/bin, which was
writable by the ubuntu user and prioritized in $PATH, to execute
arbitrary commands as root. While container breakout proved impossible
due to patching, the vulnerability demonstrated how improper PATH
handling in privileged scripts can lead to privilege escalation even
in sandboxed environments. 

 OSS-FUZZ INTEGRATIONS VIA AGENT-BASED BUILD GENERATION (13 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 OSS-Fuzz-Gen introduced an agent-based LLM approach that
automatically generates build scripts and fuzzing harnesses for
integrating projects into OSS-Fuzz, using iterative command execution
and environment exploration to handle diverse C/C++ codebases. The
system achieved 88 successful integrations from 225 tested
repositories, demonstrating its ability to handle complex builds that
require custom tools and dependencies. Key limitations include build
scripts that avoid target source code or only support single-harness
compilation, requiring post-processing validation improvements. 

 AI AND SECURE CODE GENERATION (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The emergence of LLMs and coding agents fundamentally transforms
application security, as AI now both writes and debugs code. As LLMs
advance, humans will focus more on prioritizing vulnerabilities,
providing additional context, and assessing exploitability. The
vulnerability disclosure process will also become much quicker, with
LLMs rapidly identifying vulnerabilities and offensive and defensive
teams promptly collaborating to evaluate exploitability.

 HOW CNAPP VENDORS STACK UP IN 2025 (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Cloud security is crowded — and evolving fast. If you're trying to
make sense of the vendor landscape, this new report from IDC is a
great place to start. 

_THE 2025 IDC MARKETSCAPE FOR CNAPP_ [11] provides a detailed review
of the top platforms on the market, including technical assessments,
customer insights, and strategic analysis.

 AI-WATERMARK (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 UnMarker is designed to be the first universal attack against
defensive watermarking, which is used to detect AI-generated
deepfakes. The attack disrupts watermarks in image spectral amplitudes
without requiring detector feedback or knowledge of the scheme,
thereby defeating both traditional and advanced semantic watermarking
systems and rendering deepfake detection ineffective. 

 HERODEVS (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 HeroDevs provides commercial licenses to over 30 Never-Ending Support
(NES) products, which are patched versions of software that
organizations already use, behave identically, and are compatible with
modern browsers and key third-party libraries. 

 HYPNUS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 hypnus is a Rust library for memory obfuscation designed to protect
memory regions during inactivity or sleep periods.

 AFTER BLACKSUIT IS TAKEN DOWN, NEW RANSOMWARE GROUP CHAOS EMERGES (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 International law enforcement's Operation CheckMate dismantled the
BlackSuit ransomware group, but a new group called "Chaos" quickly
emerged, likely comprising former BlackSuit members. Chaos is
targeting major organizations primarily in the US, demanding ransoms
of around $300,000. 

 SCATTERED SPIDER IS RUNNING A VMWARE ESXI HACKING SPREE (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Scattered Spider is targeting VMware ESXi hypervisors across retail,
airline, transportation, and insurance sectors using social
engineering to impersonate employees and trick IT help desks into
resetting passwords for privileged accounts. Once they gain vCenter
access, attackers enable SSH on ESXi hosts, perform "disk-swap"
attacks to extract the NTDS.dit Active Directory database, wipe
backups, and deploy ransomware to encrypt all VMs in the datastores.
Google recommends hardening vSphere with execInstalledOnly, VM
encryption, disabled SSH, phishing-resistant MFA, isolating Tier 0
assets, and centralizing logs in a SIEM to detect suspicious vCenter
logins and configuration changes. 

 ANNOUNCING CHAINGUARD LIBRARIES FOR PYTHON: MALWARE-RESISTANT
DEPENDENCIES BUILT SECURELY FROM SOURCE (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Chainguard's Libraries for Python is a secure index that rebuilds
Python packages and their dependency trees from source within a
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Level 2-hardened
setup to prevent supply chain threats. The platform specifically
addresses Python wheels with native code and re-bundled OS libraries,
such as OpenSSL, which create "software dark matter" that is hidden
from SCA scanners. Early testing indicates that 98% of known malicious
packages would be identified and blocked. This development follows
notable incidents in 2023 and 2024 that involved attacks on PyTorch
and Ultralytics YOLO where compromised builds and leaked API tokens
facilitated malware distribution via PyPI.
