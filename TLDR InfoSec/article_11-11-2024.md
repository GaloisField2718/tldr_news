 WEBINAR: SAVE TIME ON SECURITY REVIEWS WITH QUESTIONNAIRE AUTOMATION
& TRUST CENTER (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Companies are paying much closer attention to how vendors handle
their data. For security leaders, this means more time spent on
security reviews, which end up becoming a daily time sink.

Watch this on-demand webinar to learn how Vanta can help you:

	* Save time by leveraging AI-generated responses [5] to security
questionnaires
 	* Reduce inbound questionnaires and build trust with Trust Center
[6]
 	* Turn security and compliance into a revenue accelerator

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 D-LINK WON'T FIX CRITICAL FLAW AFFECTING 60,000 OLDER NAS DEVICES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over 60,000 older D-Link NAS devices are at risk due to a critical
security flaw that won't be fixed by the company. The vulnerability
allows attackers to inject commands using specially crafted HTTP
requests. D-Link has advised users to retire these vulnerable products
or restrict their internet access. 

 CISCO BUG LETS HACKERS RUN COMMANDS AS ROOT ON UWRB ACCESS POINTS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cisco has disclosed a new critical CVE that allows for RCE on
Ultra-Reliable Wireless Backhaul (URWB) access points. Attackers can
exploit improper input validation on the web-based management
interface of vulnerable devices by sending crafted requests to execute
arbitrary commands. The vulnerability only affects URWB devices
running vulnerable software with the URWB operating mode enabled which
can be checked by seeing if the show mpls-config CLI command is
available. 

 CISA WARNS OF CRITICAL PALO ALTO NETWORKS BUG EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The CISA warned that attackers are actively exploiting a critical
missing authentication vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Expedition,
a tool for migrating firewall configurations from other vendors to
PanOS. The vulnerability allows attackers with network access to
takeover Expedition admin accounts and potentially access
configuration secrets, credentials, and other data. All Expedition
usernames, passwords, API keys, and any firewalls processed by
Expedition should be rotated after upgrading. Various proof-of-concept
attack chains that exploit the vulnerability to obtain admin access to
Palo Alto Networks firewalls are available in the article.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A NEW ERA OF MACOS SANDBOX ESCAPES: DIVING INTO AN OVERLOOKED ATTACK
SURFACE AND UNCOVERING 10+ NEW VULNERABILITIES (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in macOS sandbox
escapes that allow attackers to bypass app sandbox restrictions and
execute arbitrary system commands. Exploiting overlooked XPC services
in system frameworks can lead to full sandbox escapes where dropped
files are not quarantined, enabling attackers to escape sandbox
restrictions. Apple addressed some of these vulnerabilities in macOS
Ventura 13.3 by implementing checks on incoming XPC clients to prevent
unauthorized sandbox escapes. 

 BEYOND RCE: AUTONOMOUS CODE EXECUTION IN AGENTIC AI (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Anthropic's Computer Use is a new feature of Claude that allows
Claude to use a virtual environment to complete tasks on the user's
computer. Claude can be deceived into running malicious web content in
computer use mode. The model does include some protections against
hijacking as well as some protections against running some malicious
commands but can still be “phished” to execute arbitrary commands.
Claude can be convinced to curl an arbitrary file and pipe it to bash
by a document telling it that it was a necessary codec. The model can
be fooled into opening the calculator application by a remote PDF. 

 DELEGATING SECURITY REMEDIATIONS TO EMPLOYEES VIA SLACK (5 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Slack interactions come in four categories: remind, alert, delegate,
and respond. Remind and alert actions are more commonplace. Remind
interactions remind users to take an action (such as mandatory
training) and alert actions alert the security team to various alerts
from other sources. There are two new categories in SlackSecOps called
delegate and respond. Delegate actions involve an alert asking a user
if a behavior was intentional (adding a contractor to a sensitive
permission, sharing documents, etc) and only alerts the security team
based on the response. Respond interactions are when a security team
receives a request and can respond to it directly via Slack such as
approving an access request and granting the access directly in Slack.
