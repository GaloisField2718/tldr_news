 AI AND CODE SECURITY: HYPE VS. REALITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The AI security landscape is evolving fast, and vendors are racing to
prove their tools can deliver real-world value. But how effective is
AI in actually fixing security vulnerabilities?

A 2025 report by Latio Tech [4] assesses different technical
approaches and vendors to help security professionals and engineering
leaders cut through the hype and understand which AI-driven tools
provide meaningful value—and which ones fall short.

Vendors were evaluated based on their capability to detect or ingest
SAST reports, create actual code fixes [4], and support AppSec teams
in reducing vulnerabilities efficiently.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VO1D BOTNET EVOLVES AS IT ENSNARES 1.6 MILLION ANDROID TV BOXES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Vo1d botnet has grown to infect 1.3 million Android TV boxes
worldwide, with daily activity from 800,000 IPs and a peak of 1.6
million. It evolved to this size thanks to enhanced encryption,
anti-detection features, and improved resilience against takedowns. 

 NEARLY 12K API KEYS AND PASSWORDS FOUND IN AI TRAINING DATA (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Researchers at Truffle Security scanned 400TB of data from the Common
Crawl December 2024 archive. Common Crawl is a non-profit that
regularly publishes massive crawled web data datasets frequently used
to train LLMs. The researchers identified 219 distinct secret types,
including valid AWS, MailChimp, and WalkScore API keys. 

 NEW TGTOXIC BANKING TROJAN VARIANT EVOLVES WITH ANTI-ANALYSIS
UPGRADES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TgToxic is an Android malware first documented in early 2023 as a
banking Trojan capable of stealing credentials and funds from crypto
wallets and finance apps. Later analysis identified that it has
evolved with new anti-analysis and C2 domain generation capabilities.
Google has stated that it did not detect TgToxic in any apps in the
Google Play store.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GAIN CODE EXECUTION ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND HUNDREDS OF
POPULAR APPS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This author discovered a critical vulnerability in ToDesktop, an
electron app bundler service used by popular applications, including
ClickUp, Cursor, Linear, and Notion Calendar. The vulnerability
allowed the author to exploit a Firebase database, gaining access to
the deployment pipeline and enabling code execution capabilities.
ToDesktop promptly fixed the issue by separating the signing step into
a separate sidecar container. 

 WALLBLEED: A MEMORY DISCLOSURE VULNERABILITY IN THE GREAT FIREWALL OF
CHINA (1 HOUR READ) [9] 

 Wallbleed was a vulnerability in China's Great Firewall that leaked
memory during DNS query censorship, revealing internal operations. It
was partially patched in November 2023 and fully resolved by March
2024. This report outlines how researchers discovered the
vulnerability and the ethics of exploiting and disclosing such
vulnerabilities. 

 SUBSTACK DOMAIN TAKEOVER (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Substack allows writers to use custom domains for their blogs by
creating a CNAME record pointing to Substack's servers. However,
Substack does not authenticate that a customer owns a domain at this
step. Attackers can potentially hijack inactive custom domains
previously connected to Substack blogs, even though Substack charges a
$50 fee for the feature.

 HOW HACKERS CAPTURE YOUR SOLAR PANELS AND CAUSE GRID HAVOC (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 German broadcaster DW reports that hackers could access millions of
solar panels responsible for hundreds of GW of electricity output via
remote cloud-based services. Although the vendors have denied
detecting any malicious access, attackers exploiting such
vulnerabilities could lead to widespread blackouts in the European
power grid. The EU is introducing regulations to enhance cybersecurity
and protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks.
