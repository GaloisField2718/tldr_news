 ENRICHING THREAT INTELLIGENCE WITH MAPPINGS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post talks about utilizing the control and security stack
mappings created by the Center for Threat-Informed Defense (Center).
These mappings, like NIST 800-53 Control Mappings and Security Stack
Mappings for Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, enable
defenders to connect threat information to actionable guidance, making
it easier to detect and mitigate threats. Center is also working on
expanding its collection of mappings and making them more accessible.
