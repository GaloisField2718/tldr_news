 WEBINAR: HOW REDDIT MATURED ACCESS MANAGEMENT WITH 1PASSWORD
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Poorly-managed passwords are the #1 cause of breaches, and they leave
IT teams struggling with fragmented access management and manual
onboarding/offboarding processes. Reddit was dealing with all these
challenges, plus a compromised security vendor. They needed a solution
that reduced credential risk without slowing down their employees.

In this webinar [4], Reddit's Sr. Manager of Enterprise Security &
Systems, Nick Fohs, shares the inside story of how his team used
1Password to manage credentials across the entire company. You'll get
a first-hand look at the problems they faced, and the impact 1Password
has had on security and efficiency.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 'CHATGPT TAINTED MEMORIES' EXPLOIT ENABLES COMMAND INJECTION IN ATLAS
BROWSER (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 LayerX Security uncovered a flaw in OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas browser
that allows attackers to inject malicious commands, leading to remote
code execution and persistent access. The exploit manipulates the
browser's AI functions to process hidden malicious instructions, as
Atlas provides 90% less phishing protection than Chrome or Edge.
Security teams should restrict Atlas for sensitive accounts, monitor
endpoints, and await OpenAI patches, treating AI browsers as higher
risk with heightened security. 

 MASSIVE CHINA-LINKED SMISHING CAMPAIGN LEVERAGED 194,000 DOMAINS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An extensive SMS phishing campaign, attributed to a Chinese-speaking
group called Smishing Triad, has used over 194,000 domains since early
2024. The attackers impersonated services such as banks and delivery
firms to steal personal data via urgent texts. Their tactics include
cycling through disposable domains and running a phishing-as-a-service
operation, making detection challenging for authorities worldwide. 

 WESTERN SYDNEY UNI SUFFERS DATA BREACH, AGAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Western Sydney University (WSU) reported its third security incident
of the year, with an unauthorized user accessing data belonging to
staff and students. The breached data includes tax file numbers, bank
account details, passport and driver's license details, visa
information, health and disability information, addresses, email
addresses, phone numbers, names, dates of birth, ethnicities, and
student and staff IDs. WSU stated that the breach was caused by a
daisy chain of supply chain attacks culminating in a third-party
student management system being breached.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAKING A VIRTUAL MACHINE LOOK LIKE REAL HARDWARE TO MALWARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Malware can easily detect VirtualBox environments through obvious
indicators such as registry keys, file artifacts, MAC addresses, and
VirtualBox-specific naming conventions, undermining VM-based malware
analysis. Security researchers created vbox_stealth (Bash) and
VBoxCloak (PowerShell) tools to mask VM indicators by renaming
hardware identifiers, modifying registry entries, and removing
VirtualBox-specific processes and files. While these tools improve VM
stealth capabilities, sophisticated malware may still employ more
subtle detection methods that remain difficult to circumvent. 

 ECS ON EC2: COVERING GAPS IN IMDS HARDENING (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When launching AWS ECS tasks on EC2 instances, each task, by default,
has access to the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), which can be used
to access credentials of other tasks or to escalate privileges to the
instance role. Using IMDSv2 with a hop limit of 1 is not effective for
stopping this attack vector, as some networking modes can still access
IMDS. The article includes details for blocking IMDS access in each
networking mode. 

 AI BROWSERS FACE A SECURITY FLAW AS INEVITABLE AS DEATH AND TAXES (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prompt injection is an increasingly critical security issue as
AI-driven browsers gain agentic capabilities: they can now act on
users' behalf, from opening web pages to handling emails and files.
This opens up new attack vectors, such as direct injection via URLs or
indirect injection hidden within website or document text, allowing
attackers to trick bots into performing dangerous actions without user
consent. While some countermeasures, such as reduced privileges and
human oversight, can lower risks, experts believe prompt injection is
unavoidable, not just a bug but a fundamental vulnerability whenever
AI interprets untrusted data.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OSDFIR INFRASTRUCTURE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 OSDFIR Infrastructure is a Kubernetes-based platform that uses Helm
charts to simplify the deployment and integration of multiple open
source digital forensics tools, including Timesketch, Yeti, OpenRelik,
GRR, and others. The platform enables collaborative forensic
investigations by providing a unified environment where tools can work
together and share data through workflows and integrations. It
streamlines the setup process for DFIR teams who want to deploy a
comprehensive suite of forensic analysis tools in local or cloud
Kubernetes clusters. 

 SUBLIME SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Sublime Security has developed an agentic email security platform
that leverages AI agents to analyze messages in search of threats. The
platform uses a distributed detection model that conducts intent and
behavioral analysis, along with deep content inspection. 

 OPENNHP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A lightweight, cryptography-powered, open-source toolkit built to
enforce Zero Trust security for infrastructure, applications, and data
in the AI-driven world.

 NYDFS ISSUES GUIDANCE ON 3RD PARTY CYBERSECURITY RISKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 The New York State Department of Financial Services announced new
guidance regarding the use of third-party service providers.
Third-party suppliers can cause supply chain attacks if attackers
compromise them, and can be the weak link in an organization's
security strategy. The new guidance does not impose new regulations or
restrictions on regulated organizations. 

 TOOLSHELL USED TO COMPROMISE TELECOMS COMPANY IN MIDDLE EAST (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chinese threat actors exploited the ToolShell SharePoint
vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770) just two days after Microsoft patched
it in July, compromising a Middle East telecoms company and multiple
government agencies by using the Zingdoor backdoor, the ShadowPad
Trojan, and KrustyLoader malware. The attackers demonstrated rapid
exploitation capabilities by mass-scanning for vulnerable systems,
then deploying sophisticated toolsets, including DLL sideloading
techniques, credential-dumping utilities, and the Sliver C2 framework
for persistent access. Organizations should prioritize immediate
patching of SharePoint servers and monitor for indicators, including
the provided file hashes, with particular focus on DLL sideloading
activities and connections to the identified AWS-hosted C2
infrastructure. 

 INSIDER THREATS LOOM WHILE RANSOM PAYMENT RATES PLUMMET (13 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Ransomware groups are adapting as ransom payment rates hit historic
lows at just 23% of ransom attacks. Attackers are increasingly using
social engineering and insider bribes, like in Medusa's BBC attack,
driven by shrinking profits and tougher defenses. Mid-market firms
remain the most frequent victims, but larger enterprises face new,
targeted extortion methods.
