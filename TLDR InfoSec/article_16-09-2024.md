 SHRINK YOUR CLOUD ATTACK SURFACE BY 90% IN A FEW DAYS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Did you know less than 10% of cloud identities with sensitive cloud
permissions actually use them? Sonrai's Cloud Permissions Firewall [4]
tackles this head-on, by quickly identifying and quarantining these
‚Äúzombies‚Äù lurking in your AWS environment!

Within days, Cloud Permissions Firewall [4]:

 	* Restricts unused sensitive permissions and services
 	* Quarantines unused identities
 	* Restricts access to specific cloud regions

The best part? Zero disruption to DevOps, and if a quarantined
‚ÄúZombie‚Äù needs to be used later on, simply wake them up with a
permissions request through chat tools like Slack. Making requests and
approvals quick and painless. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FORTINET CONFIRMS DATA BREACH AFTER HACKER CLAIMS TO STEAL 440GB OF
FILES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Last week, a threat actor posted credentials to an S3 bucket
containing 440GB of files allegedly stolen from a Microsoft Sharepoint
server belonging to Fortinet. Fortinet has confirmed that it
experienced a breach due to an exposed third-party cloud-based file
drive. It has stated that the breach only affects 0.3% of customers. 

 FAKE PASSWORD MANAGER CODING TEST USED TO HACK PYTHON DEVELOPERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The North Korean Lazarus hacking group launched a campaign where it
approached Python developers with a coding interview challenge. The
candidates were tasked with finding and fixing bugs in a password
manager application that pulled in two malicious PyPi packages that
executed an obfuscated C2 payload in their __init__.py. Candidates
were rushed to complete the assignment due to tight deadlines listed
in the README file that may have led to them skipping some security
checks. 

 GAZEPLOIT COULD WORK OUT VISION PRO USER PASSWORDS FROM WATCHING
THEIR AVATAR (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have developed a new exploit, dubbed GAZEploit, that uses
a neural network to detect Vision Pro users' passwords based on the
eye movements reflected in their avatars' faces when the on-screen
keyboard is pulled up. The researchers managed to achieve an 85.9%
precision rate and 96.8% recall rate in their test of 30 users. Apple
has fixed this vulnerability by disabling avatars while the virtual
keyboard is pulled up.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EVIL MSI. A STORY ABOUT VULNERABILITIES IN MSI FILES (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This post provides a primer on finding vulnerabilities in MSI files.
It begins with an overview of the MSI file format and details the
tables that may be relevant. It then covers ways to enumerate MSI
files and common attack vectors such as abandoned credentials, custom
actions, and GUI escapes. The post also provides examples of utilizing
tools to automate the procedure as well as a tool that they wrote. 

 OFFENSIVE AI AGENTS: A TIMELINE OF MY RESEARCH (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Jeff Sims, a frontier AI/ML cyber researcher, shares a timeline of
his research on offensive AI agents, including BlackMamba, EyeSpy, and
Red Reaper. These AI systems demonstrate the potential for adversarial
use of AI technology and the need for awareness in the field. Sims'
research focuses on developing advanced offensive AI agents capable of
self-training and targeting other AI systems. 

 SSH KEYSTROKE OBFUSCATION BYPASS (11 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenSSH 9.5 added keystroke timing obfuscation to prevent traffic
analysis attacks. The feature hides keystroke timings and floods chaff
packets to obscure real keystrokes. This blog post walks through how
analyzing packet sizes can reveal keystrokes and their types, aiding
in traffic analysis.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 INTRODUCING SIGMALITE. RUNREVEAL'S OPEN SOURCE SIGMA RULE EVALUATOR
FOR DETECTION (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 RunReveal has released Sigmalite, an open-source sigma rule evaluator
for detection, under the Apache 2.0 license for stream processing.
Sigmalite allows security teams to use sigma rules for detections
outside of their SIEM, providing flexibility in log processing and
detection. By integrating Sigmalite into its pipeline, RunReveal aims
to offer customers the ability to easily create, validate, and run
sigma detections for better log management and correlation. 

 SIMPLIFY SBOM MANAGEMENT FOR DEVELOPERS: INTRODUCING BOMCTL (3 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Bomctl is a new tool within OpenSSF that helps manage Software Bill
of Materials (SBOMs) for developers. It aims to simplify handling SBOM
documents by providing a command-line interface for retrieving,
storing, and manipulating component information. Bomctl supports
complex SBOM operations and aims to facilitate integration with
existing SBOM tooling ecosystems. 

 BOUNTYHUNTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 The Bounty Hunter plugin for Caldera enhances emulation by simulating
realistic cyberattack chains. Existing tools that automate assessments
can be limited and predictable. bountyhunter uses real-world attacker
tactics to emulate realistic scenarios.

 PORT OF SEATTLE HIT BY RHYSIDA RANSOMWARE IN AUGUST ATTACK (2 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The Port of Seattle was attacked by Rhysida ransomware, causing
disruptions to critical systems like reservation check-in and flight
delays. The ransomware gang demanded payment, but the Port refused,
choosing to restore affected systems instead. Rhysida is known for
targeting various industries and has been linked to attacks on
healthcare organizations and other high-profile targets. 

 A NEW PATH FOR KYBER ON THE WEB (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google is making changes to Chrome to switch from supporting the
Kyber algorithm to the new ML-KEM algorithm for post-quantum key
exchange. The switch is necessary due to the standardization of ML-KEM
and incompatibility with the previous version of Kyber. Server
operators can temporarily support both algorithms to maintain
post-quantum security while clients update their implementations. 

 ACQUIRING MALICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSION SAMPLES ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET
(10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The blog post explains how to acquire and decrypt samples of a
malicious browser extension using free resources and simple
cryptanalysis techniques. By leveraging services like urlscan, the
author was able to identify potentially malicious domains and scripts
used by the malware. The analysis revealed active and potentially
harmful domains, highlighting the importance of monitoring and
detecting malicious activities online.
