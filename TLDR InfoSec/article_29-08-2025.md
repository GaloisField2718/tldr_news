 EMAIL IS STILL BUSINESS-CRITICAL. THE DATA BACKS IT UP. (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Forget the idea that email is fading. Nearly 9 IN 10 IT LEADERS say
direct email is still critical to how their business
communicates—more than Slack, Teams, or even collaboration tools.
Why? Because email is auditable, reliable, and built for messages that
matter. 

From infrastructure updates to policy enforcement, 48% OF ALL BUSINESS
COMMUNICATION STILL RELIES PRIMARILY ON EMAIL. In high-trust
industries like tech and finance [5], that number climbs even
higher. 

Read how IT teams are modernizing email without disrupting what
works—and why this channel still earns its place at the center of
business operations.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FREEPBX SERVERS HACKED VIA ZERO-DAY, EMERGENCY FIX RELEASED (4 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 There is an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability affecting
systems with exposed Administrator Control Panel (ACP). Hackers have
exploited it since August 21, compromising servers and affecting
thousands of SIP extensions, allowing attackers to run commands as the
Asterisk user. Sangoma has released emergency EDGE module fixes. It
recommends blocking ACP access, restoring from pre-August 21 backups
if compromised, and rotating all credentials. 

 TRANSUNION SAYS HACKERS STOLE 4.4 MILLION CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL
INFORMATION (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hackers accessed the personal data of over 4.4 million TransUnion
customers through a breach in a third-party application, although the
credit data itself was not compromised. Stolen information included
names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers. This incident is part
of a recent wave of major corporate data breaches in the US. Companies
like Google and Allianz Life were also affected.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SLIDING INTO YOUR DMS: ABUSING MICROSOFT TEAMS FOR MALWARE DELIVERY
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers are increasingly using Microsoft Teams for the delivery of
malware. Impersonating IT support, they send direct messages or calls
from fake or compromised accounts, tricking users into installing
remote access tools or running malicious PowerShell payloads. These
sophisticated campaigns leverage social engineering, exploit the trust
in Teams' internal messaging, and use advanced techniques to steal
credentials, maintain persistence, and evade detection. Defenders are
advised to remain vigilant for unusual Teams activity and
impersonation attempts and to recognize the signs of such malware
attacks for improved response and mitigation. 

 AWS DETECTION ENGINEERING: MASTERING LOG SOURCES FOR THREAT DETECTION
(11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post provides an overview of how to utilize CloudTrail, VPC Flow
Logs, GuardDuty, ALB Logs, and AWS Config for threat detection in AWS.
It lists sample alerts for each data source, as well as cross-service
alerts, and demonstrates how these alerts can inform automated
enforcement actions. Continuous validation is important for ensuring
that rules remain consistent with an organization's environment. 

 THE AGENTIC THREAT HUNTER (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Threat hunting follows the scientific method in which analysts
observe logs, develop hypotheses, test the hypotheses, and iterate,
but this model is crumbling under the vast amount of logs present in
modern environments. To augment security teams, AI agents can be used
to monitor vast amounts of logs and develop initial hypotheses to
augment security teams. SOCs can begin leveraging agentic AI by
developing explicit hypotheses, pairing with AI for investigations,
centralizing data in a SIEM or data lake, setting appropriate
guardrails for the agents, and then automating repetitive tasks.

 RITA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Real Intelligence Threat Analytics (RITA) is a framework for
detecting command and control communication through network traffic
analysis. 

 ATEAM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 The Azure Tenant Enumeration and Attribution Module (ATEAM) is a
reconnaissance tool that discovers Azure services and attributes
tenant ownership based on their responses. 

 PYGHIDRA-MCP: HEADLESS GHIDRA MCP SERVER FOR PROJECT-WIDE,
MULTI-BINARY ANALYSIS (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 pyghidra-mcp is a headless Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for
Ghidra that enables LLMs to perform project-wide analysis across
multiple interconnected binaries in a single session, moving beyond
traditional single-file reverse engineering. The tool demonstrates
ecosystem-aware analysis by tracing function calls across entire
application stacks, such as following a file creation operation from
notepad.exe through kernel32.dll to ntdll.dll and the Windows kernel.
Built for automation and CI/CD integration, pyghidra-mcp leverages
Ghidra's project management capabilities to expose entire software
ecosystems for AI-powered reverse engineering workflows.

 STORM-0501 DEBUTS A BRUTAL HYBRID RANSOMWARE ATTACK CHAIN (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Storm-0501 has developed a sophisticated hybrid ransomware attack
that exploits privileged accounts to move between on-premises and
cloud environments, utilizing techniques such as DCSync attacks to
gain domain control and leveraging federated domains as backdoors. The
threat actor not only encrypts data, but also mass-deletes cloud
resources, including backups, creating a "no-win situation" where
organizations cannot recover without paying ransom. CISOs should
implement least privilege access, audit on-premises environments for
cloud migration opportunities, and regularly practice ransomware
response playbooks to defend against this brutal attack chain. 

 MICROSOFT WORD WILL SAVE YOUR FILES TO THE CLOUD BY DEFAULT (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Microsoft will start automatically saving any Word documents in
OneDrive. Users will be able to change how new files are created in
the Save page in the Word options. The feature was included in the
latest Microsoft 365 Insiders Beta Channel update. 

 SKT HIT WITH $97M PENALTY FOR SECURITY LAPSES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 South Korea fined SK Telecom 134.8 billion won ($97.2 million) after
a SIM data breach exposed the personal data of all customers due to
poor security and delayed reporting. The breach affected 23 million
users, causing significant financial losses and a decline in SKT's
profit and customer base. Authorities ordered audits and improvements
as SKT invests heavily in new security systems.
