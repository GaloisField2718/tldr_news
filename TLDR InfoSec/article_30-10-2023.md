ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 THREE NEW NGINX INGRESS CONTROLLER VULNERABILITIES REPORTED AND HOW
THEY AFFECT KUBERNETES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Three new vulnerabilities related to the NGINX ingress component in
Kubernetes (CVE-2023-5043, CVE-2023-5044, and CVE-2022-4886) were
reported on October 27th. These vulnerabilities allow attackers who
can control the configuration of the Ingress object to steal secret
credentials from the cluster, including credentials for the Kubernetes
API server with very high privileges. 

 IPHONES HAVE BEEN EXPOSING YOUR UNIQUE MAC (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple introduced a feature in iOS 14 that claimed to display a
unique, private MAC address for each SSID an iPhone connected to. Two
security researchers discovered that this feature doesn‚Äôt work on
iOS 17.1. They then tested all versions of the feature since it was
released and learned that it had never worked. The researchers
discovered that the iPhone would send the private MAC address in the
source field in multicast messages upon joining a network but the real
MAC address would still be sent in a different field. 

 CITRIX WARNS ADMINS TO PATCH CITRIX BLEED (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Citrix warns all admins of Netscaler ADC and Gateway appliances to
immediately secure their systems from an actively exploited
vulnerability dubbed Citrix Bleed (CVE-2023-4966). The 9.4
vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to launch a low
complexity attack to remotely disclose session tokens and hijack
authenticated sessions with no user interaction. This article includes
commands to kill all sessions and details of the patched versions.

 LEARNING ABOUT SIMULATED ADVERSARIES FROM HUMAN DEFENDERS USING
INTERACTIVE CYBER-DEFENSE GAMES (29 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This study looked at the behavior of human defenders against two
different attack strategies, Beeline and Meander, and how it affected
the emergence of defense strategies. The results showed that although
human defenders initially had more difficulty stopping the Beeline
adversary, they were able to learn to stop it by taking advantage of
their attack strategy.

 SOPHISTICATED STRIPEDFLY SPY PLATFORM MASQUERADED FOR YEARS AS CRYPTO
MINER (8 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The StripedFly malware was first discovered by Kaspersky researchers
in 2017 and was initially believed to be a cryptocurrency miner.
Researchers discovered that the miner was actually a cover for a
highly sophisticated spy platform. The malware uses a custom TOR
client to transmit communication and siphoned data between infected
systems and the attackers' command and control server and has a
ransomware component that has infected a small subset of victims. 

 AMAZON RDS AND AURORA CERTIFICATES EXPIRING SOON (12 MINUTE READ)
[15]

ORGANIZATIONAL RISK (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Many organizations' expanding attack surfaces, from digital
transformation and hybrid work, drive cyber risk, with threats rapidly
evolving. Quantifying security solution efficacy through metrics like
catch rate is challenging with the variables involved. This piece
examines what catch rate indicates about financial risk mitigation. 

 CHATBOT HALLUCINATIONS ARE POISONING WEB SEARCH (7 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A study of how generative AI chatbot ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù, or false
information generated by AI chatbots, are harming search results. The
study focuses on an example in which a researcher wrote a blog post
that was meant to test how an LLM could be tricked into generating a
summary using a fictional article. The researcher discovered that
their fictional article was highlighted in Bing search results even
after they added explicit text in the blog post to try and dissuade
the Bing search results.
