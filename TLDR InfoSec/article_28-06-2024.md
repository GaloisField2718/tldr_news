 üÜï¬†ORCA INTRODUCES SCM POSTURE MANAGEMENT (SCM-PM) TO TACKLE
MISCONFIGURATIONS IN GITHUB AND GITLAB (SPONSOR) [4] 

 'Shift Left Security' doesn't end with code. Misconfigurations in
source code management [4] (SCM) platforms like GitHub can be a
serious problem. For example:

 	* Disabled branch protections [4] can allow threat actors to make
unauthorized changes and compromise codebase integrity.
 	* Unmaintained repositories [4] increase the risk of known
vulnerabilities and one-day attacks.
 	* Default GitHub Actions configuration may allow workflows to
approve pull requests, enabling attackers to inject malicious code.

‚ÜóÔ∏è Orca Security is diving into this space with new SCM Posture
Management (SCM-PM) capabilities [4]. Customers can now detect
misconfigurations, automate fixes, and gain full visibility into
GitHub + GitLab accounts and repositories.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FRESH MOVEIT BUG UNDER ATTACK MERE HOURS AFTER DISCLOSURE (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A new vulnerability affecting the SFTP module of MOVEit's software
has been disclosed. With a CVSS score of 7.4, the vulnerability allows
attackers to perform a forced authentication attack or upload an SSH
public key to impersonate users without authentication. The
vulnerability is under active exploitation. 

 OLLAMA PATCHES REMOTE EXECUTION VULNERABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ollama recently fixed a vulnerability discovered by Wiz that could
result in path traversal. The vulnerability exploits the lack of input
validation in the /api/pull endpoint of the Ollama servers by using a
specially crafted request to overwrite arbitrary files on the host
system. Wiz's researchers note that there are still publicly exposed
Ollama servers that are vulnerable to this flaw. 

 SOUTH KOREAN TELECOM COMPANY ATTACKS CUSTOMERS WITH MALWARE (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A South Korean telecom company infected over 600,000 users with
malware for using torrent services. The malware caused missing files,
created strange folders, and disabled PCs. Police identified and
charged individuals connected to the attack. Investigations are still
ongoing.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TALES FROM THE CLOUD TRENCHES: RAIDING FOR AWS VAULTS, BUCKETS, AND
SECRETS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post examines behavior from an attacker that Datadog saw in
several customer environments. The attacker probed for S3 buckets and
AWS Secrets Manager secrets, which is common but also, less commonly,
probed for Glacier vaults. In all cases, the attacker did not take
follow on actions. The attacker also signed their AWS API requests
manually as opposed to using a library such as boto3, which handles
signing. 

 WHY ARE HMAC KEYS CONSIDERED UNAUDITABLE AND UNMANAGEABLE IN GOOGLE
CLOUD? (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post describes how Google Cloud HMAC keys have
vulnerabilities related to logging, management, and auditing. Users
can create unlimited HMAC keys without proper oversight or control.
These issues could lead to security risks and challenges for
administrators in Google Cloud. 

 AUTOMATED LLM BUGFINDERS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post was written as a response to Google Project Zero's
naptime LLM tool and proposes an alternative approach to building
automated bug finders. Different approaches, such as the Catalyst-AI
Reasoning Module, aim to enhance LLMs' effectiveness in detecting bugs
by utilizing specific prompts and tools.
