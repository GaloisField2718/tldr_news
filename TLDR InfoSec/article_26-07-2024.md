 TINES IS THE SECURE WAY TO INTRODUCE LLM-POWERED AUTOMATION TO YOUR
SECURITY WORKFLOWS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For security professionals, AI is double-edged. Falling behind is
risky, but so is jumping right in. What's the right balance?

AI in Tines [4]¬†is designed with security and privacy in mind - you
decide when and how your workflows [4] interact with AI.

Here's what security folks are saying ‚ÜòÔ∏è

Amulya Namburi, SOAR Team Lead, Experian: ‚ÄúAutomatic mode is a
game-changer for new users; it makes the learning curve for advanced
use cases very short.‚Äù

Allen Cox, Senior Director of Security and IT,¬†MyFitnessPal [5]:
"It's unlocking new use cases for us.‚Äù

Kyle McGaley, Senior Security Engineer, Udemy: ‚ÄúIn terms of what you
can build with [Tines], the limit is your imagination.‚Äù

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MICHIGAN MEDICINE NOTIFIES NEARLY 57K PATIENTS AFTER HEALTH
INFORMATION POTENTIALLY EXPOSED IN CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Michigan Medicine reported a data breach affecting approximately
57,000 individuals. Hackers accessed employee email accounts on May 23
and 29 and potentially accessed personal and health information. 

 KNOWBE4 DISCOVERS REMOTE WORKER IS REALLY A NORTH KOREAN HACKER (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 KnowBe4 recently disclosed that a remote software engineer that it
hired was a North Korean hacker who was able to make it through the
interview process and pass a background check. KnowBe4 detected that
the hacker's Mac immediately started loading malware. The employee
refused to take a call with the team and then became unresponsive,
which led KnowBe4 to contact the FBI and Mandiant. 

 PKFAIL: UNTRUSTED PLATFORM KEYS UNDERMINE SECURE BOOT ON UEFI
ECOSYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Binarly team has published research on how leaked private keys
like the ones from Intel Boot Guard and American Megatrends
International were exposed. Hardware containing these keys is still
being deployed. The PKfail issue exposes poor cryptographic management
practices that put devices at risk of being bypassed during the boot
process. To mitigate PKfail, device vendors should follow best
practices for key management and users should stay informed about
security patches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WE SECURELY GENERATE SENSITIVE SECRETS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Monzo wanted a secret generation process that no entity could
compromise or manipulate. Password managers with passkeys grant this
assurance but don't scale to services that need to run in cloud
environments. To achieve its goal, Monzo built a repeatable,
deterministic build process that utilized AWS Nitro Enclaves to
securely generate secrets. This was used to cryptographically verify
the integrity of environments. 

 A HARD LOOK AT GUARDDUTY SHORTCOMINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article evaluates Amazon GuardDuty's coverage, efficacy, and
cost. Coverage was limited to core attacks on core services, with few
finding types across a few services. Foundational features are worth
enabling, but others can be costly. GuardDuty failed to detect many
tested attacks and had a best-case latency of 5:08 for an S3
ransomware simulation. 

 UNFASHIONABLY SECURE: WHY WE USE ISOLATED VMS (12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post discusses the use of isolated virtual machines (VMs)
to provide complete customer data separation in the architecture of
Thinkst Canary. Each customer has their own VM, ensuring strong
boundaries between services and data. This approach offers benefits
like improved security, performance monitoring, regulatory compliance,
and hardware fault isolation.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SEC MATERIALITY FRAMEWORK (SPONSOR) [12] 

 What defines a ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù cybersecurity incident?

This framework [12], built alongside 30+ cybersecurity executives,
helps provide a baseline for determining what incidents could possibly
be reported to the SEC.

_*This does not constitute legal advice. Ultimately, ‚Äúmateriality‚Äù
should be determined by your own legal counsel._

 LAKERA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Lakera is a low-latency AI application firewall that secures traffic
into and out of generative AI applications 

 GPT4-CAPTCHA-BYPASS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This project is a CLI tool for testing various types of captchas
including puzzle, text, complicated text, and reCAPTCHA using Python
and Selenium. The tool uses OpenAI GPT-4 to help solve the captchas. 

 FLOWANALYZER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 FlowAnalyzer is a tool to help with low level understanding of OAuth
2.0 Grants/Flows. It includes support for OIDC as well as a dedicated
section on JWTs.

is actually harvesting user information and labor worth billions.
reCAPTCHA is disliked by users, costly in time and resources, and
vulnerable to bots. 

 INVISIBLE GHOST: ALARMING VULNERABILITY IN GITHUB COPILOT (8 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The "Invisible ghost" vulnerability in GitHub Copilot allows hidden
instructions to be embedded using invisible Unicode characters. It can
be used to manipulate code suggestions without developer awareness and
potentially inject harmful code. 

 CLOUDFLARE REPORTS THAT NEARLY 7% OF INTERNET TRAFFIC IS MALICIOUS (4
MINUTE READ) [18]

of all Internet traffic is malicious, with wars and elections
theorized to be driving the uptick. It also noted that DDoS attacks
are also on the rise, having blocked 4.5M DDoS attacks in the first
quarter of 2024. About 38% of all HTTP requests processed by
Cloudflare are classified as bot traffic.
