 7 STEPS TO AN AIRTIGHT GRC STRATEGY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The information security landscape is constantly changing — which
is why it's important to have a scalable and secure strategy that
evolves alongside it.

A GRC implementation [4] can provide your organization with a
structured, proactive approach to managing its IT security that helps
your business meet its goals.

Learn how to implement a GRC framework [4] with this tactical guide
from Vanta.

HERE'S WHAT'S INSIDE: 

 	* Overview of GRC strategy

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FORTINET WARNS OF AUTH BYPASS 0-DAY EXPLOITED TO HIJACK FIREWALLS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Fortinet is warning customers of an actively exploited vulnerability
in FortiOS and FortiProxy. The vulnerability allows remote attackers
to gain super admin privileges via maliciously crafted requests to the
Node.js websocket module. Fortinet reports that attackers are
exploiting this vulnerability to randomly generate admin or local
accounts and add them to new or existing SSL VPN groups. 

 OVER 660K RSYNC SERVERS EXPOSED TO CODE EXECUTION ATTACKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Google Cloud and other independent security researchers discovered 6
new vulnerabilities in rsync, one of which is critical. When two of
the vulnerabilities are chained together, attackers can achieve
unauthenticated remote code execution on default installations of
rsyncd. BleepingComputer detected 660K exposed rsync servers on Shodan
but did not verify if they were vulnerable. 

 THE GREAT GOOGLE ADS HEIST: CRIMINALS RANSACK ADVERTISER ACCOUNTS VIA
FAKE GOOGLE ADS (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Criminals are tricking Google Ads users with fake ads to steal their
account credentials. The scheme involves impersonating Google Ads and
leading victims to fraudulent login pages. This malicious operation
impacts Google's business and affects numerous customers globally.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OWASP'S NEW LLM TOP 10 SHOWS EMERGING AI THREATS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The article discusses emerging security risks in AI-powered software
development, highlighted by OWASP's Top 10 LLM vulnerabilities. Key
concerns include prompt injection, supply chain vulnerabilities,
sensitive data exposure, and RAG technology risks. 

 RELIABLE SYSTEM CALL INTERCEPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditionally, ptrace is used for system call monitoring, modifying,
and faking but this mechanism suffers from being very slow as it
requires two traps for each system call. The author presents an
alternative mechanism that uses seccomp user notify and BPF filters to
replace this functionality. The author notes that this technique
suffers from time-of-check to time-of-use attacks and should not be
used for security-critical decisions. 

 DON'T USE SESSION (SIGNAL FORK) (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The author advises against using Session due to security
vulnerabilities, such as the removal of forward secrecy and misuse of
cryptographic keys. Session's encryption practices are criticized for
reducing security measures to a mere show, making it less trustworthy
compared to other messaging apps. In summary, the author strongly
recommends avoiding Session due to significant security flaws.

security concerns. 

 2024 CVES IN REVIEW (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Analysis of 2024's CVE trends shows decreasing severity scores, with
average CVSS dropping from 7.09 to 6.9. Critical and High severity
vulnerabilities declined, while total reserved CVEs fell 7%.
WordPress-related vulnerabilities increased significantly, though this
may indicate improved security maturity rather than declining
security. 

 CISA DIRECTOR SAYS THREAT HUNTERS SPOTTED SALT TYPHOON ON FEDERAL
NETWORKS BEFORE TELCO COMPROMISES (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CISA's director Jen Easterly mentioned that threat hunters found
suspicious activity from Salt Typhoon on federal networks before
realizing it was part of a larger Chinese hacking campaign targeting
U.S. telecommunications. By identifying and seizing virtual private
servers leased by the hackers, CISA gained insight into the extent of
the hacking campaign against telecommunications companies and provided
assistance to potential victims. The incident highlights the ongoing
challenge of defending critical infrastructure from foreign
adversaries like China and the need for improved cybersecurity
measures in vulnerable sectors like telecommunications.
