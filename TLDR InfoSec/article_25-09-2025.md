ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CISCO WARNS OF IOS ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITY EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cisco has released security updates for CVE-2025-20352, a
high-severity zero-day vulnerability in IOS and IOS XE software that's
being actively exploited in the wild. The flaw stems from a
stack-based buffer overflow in the SNMP subsystem, allowing
authenticated attackers to trigger DoS conditions or achieve
root-level code execution on vulnerable devices. Cisco strongly
recommends upgrading to patched versions immediately, as no
workarounds exist beyond limiting SNMP access to trusted users. 

 STATE-SPONSORED HACKERS EXPLOITING LIBRAESVA EMAIL SECURITY GATEWAY
VULNERABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Libraesva has patched CVE-2025-59689, a command injection
vulnerability in its Email Security Gateway with a CVSS score of 6.1,
after discovering state-sponsored threat actors were actively
exploiting it. The flaw can be triggered by malicious emails, allowing
attackers to execute commands on the affected system. Organizations
using Libraesva ESG should immediately apply the available security
update to prevent exploitation. 

 LARGE-SCALE ATTACK TARGETING MACS VIA GITHUB PAGES IMPERSONATING
COMPANIES TO ATTEMPT TO DELIVER STEALER MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Attackers created fraudulent GitHub Pages impersonating over 100
companies (including LastPass, 1Password, financial institutions, and
tech firms) using SEO to rank high in search results and trick Mac
users into downloading fake software installers. The malicious sites
redirect victims through multiple layers to ultimately execute a
terminal command that downloads Atomic Stealer malware, which harvests
credentials and sensitive data from infected systems. The campaign
leverages trusted GitHub infrastructure and creates multiple backup
repositories under different usernames to evade takedown efforts while
targeting a broad range of high-value software applications.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REDISCLOSURE: NEW TECHNIQUE FOR EXPLOITING FULL-TEXT SEARCH IN MYSQL
(MYBB CASE STUDY) (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have discovered a new regular expression (regex)
injection method that exploits MySQL's Full-Text Search (FTS) boolean
mode operators to bypass input sanitization. This technique utilizes
characters like * and +, which have different meanings in FTS versus
regex. The attack extracts sensitive data without breaking SQL syntax,
demonstrated in CVE-2025-48941 in myBB, where attackers could
enumerate deleted thread titles by observing search redirects instead
of error messages. This is risky because FTS functions are often
unsanitized, as developers don't view them as regular expressions, and
the payloads can evade WAFs and security scanners. 

 PROJECT RAIN:L1TF (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 L1TF Reloaded is a complex attack chain that uses half-Spectre
gadgets to load data into L1 cache and L1 Terminal Fault to read
cross-VM secrets via kernel data structures, breaking KASLR and
extracting TLS keys. Google responded with Address Space Isolation
(ASI), removing sensitive memory from kernel space during VM execution
and mapping it during controlled transitions with buffer clearing. The
attack highlights how speculative execution vulnerabilities can bypass
privilege boundaries in virtualized environments, emphasizing the need
for comprehensive architectural defenses beyond piecemeal mitigations.


 BOOKWORM TO STATELY TAURUS USING THE UNIT 42 ATTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK
(13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 linked the Bookworm malware family to the
Chinese APT group Stately Taurus by analyzing shared artifacts,
including PDB paths, infrastructure, and targeting of Southeast Asian
governments. Using the Admiralty System, they scored evidence
reliability, reaching a confidence score of 58.4 based on toolsets,
victim profiles, timelines from 2015-2022, and environment
fingerprints. This case shows how structured attribution enables
evidence-based threat actor identification, improving cybersecurity
intelligence.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IAM STOPS AT LOGIN - ATTACKERS DON'T. SEE HOW STRONGDM GOVERNS WHAT
HAPPENS NEXT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Legacy PAM can't enforce in-session commands, and developers bypass
controls that block productivity. Meanwhile, attackers exploit these
gaps to escalate privileges and move laterally. StrongDM delivers
continuous action-layer authorization [11] across cloud-native and
ephemeral environments. Zero standing privilege, protocol-native
coverage of 100+ resource types, and just-in-time access that doesn't
frustrate developers. Start your 14-day free trial [11] 

 ZAPISEC WAF-COPILOT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 ZAPISEC WAF-Copilot is an AI-driven security framework for web
applications. It offers a highly configurable and streamlined
vulnerability assessment process using AI engines, CVE data
correlation and organization, continuous monitoring supported by a
database, and a simple, intuitive user interface. 

 DEVIOUS-WINRM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This tool allows server access via WinRM or PowerShell Remoting, with
features for capture the flag and penetration testing. It was
developed to address limitations in tools like Evil-WinRM and to
contribute to open-source security. Devious-WinRM, built on PowerShell
Remoting Protocol, uses WinRM but needs fewer permissions, especially
in basic Active Directory environments. 

 KALI LINUX 2025.3 RELEASED WITH 10 NEW TOOLS, WIFI ENHANCEMENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kali Linux 2025.3 introduces ten new security tools, including Caido
web security auditing toolkit, krbrelayx Kerberos exploitation
framework, and AI-powered tools like Gemini CLI and llm-tools-nmap for
LLM-based network scanning. The release adds Nexmon firmware patching
framework support for enhanced Wi-Fi capabilities on Raspberry Pi
devices, including Pi 5, enabling monitor mode and frame injection for
wireless security testing. Additional updates include Kali NetHunter
improvements with Samsung S10 support, CARsenal car hacking features
with new UI, and experimental Magisk kernel module installation
capabilities.

 ANOTHER BRICKSTORM: STEALTHY BACKDOOR ENABLING ESPIONAGE INTO TECH
AND LEGAL SECTORS (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 China-nexus threat actor UNC5221 uses BRICKSTORM backdoors on network
appliances and VMware infrastructure to maintain persistent access,
averaging 393 days undetected. The actor employs sophisticated
tactics, including VM cloning to extract credentials offline,
credential harvesting via BRICKSTEAL servlet filters, and legitimate
tool abuse to access M365 mailboxes and secret vaults. Organizations
should inventory unmonitored appliances, hunt for unusual internet
traffic from management interfaces, and monitor for VM cloning
activities and suspicious SSH enablement on virtualization platforms. 

 CISA SAYS HACKERS BREACHED FEDERAL AGENCY USING GEOSERVER EXPLOIT (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Attackers exploited CVE-2024-36401, a critical GeoServer RCE
vulnerability, to breach a US federal agency. They maintained access
for three weeks before detection. The threat actors deployed China
Chopper webshells, moved laterally to web and SQL servers, and used
brute force techniques for privilege escalation and credential
harvesting. Organizations should prioritize patching critical
vulnerabilities in CISA's KEV catalog and ensure continuous EDR
monitoring, as over 16,000 GeoServer instances remain exposed online. 

 SOLARWINDS FIXES WEB HELP DESK PATCH BYPASS FOR ACTIVELY EXPLOITED
FLAW — AGAIN (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 SolarWinds issued a third patch for the critical Java deserialization
vulnerability in Web Help Desk, CVE-2025-26399 bypasses
CVE-2024-28988, which bypassed the original CVE-2024-28986 flaw. This
CVE affects the AjaxProxy component, allowing unauthenticated remote
code execution. Trend Micro researchers found each patch bypass.
Experts warn that patch bypasses are common with blacklist approaches
and predict that this could be exploited, given its history of active
exploitation.
