 NOVEL MIRAI-BASED DDOS BOTNET EXPLOITS 0-DAYS TO INFECT ROUTERS AND
SECURITY CAMERAS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at Akamai's Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT)
discovered that threat actors are using zero-day vulnerabilities in
certain routers and network video recorder devices to build a
Mirai-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet called

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BUILDING YOUR FIRST METASPLOIT EXPLOIT (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 What is the process of writing an exploit and getting it published as
a metasploit module? This post outlines the process for transforming
an authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in PRTG
into a Metasploit exploit. It focuses on the development of the
exploit itself rather than the steps for exploiting the RCE. 

 ATTACKING GITLAB CI/CD VIA SHARED RUNNERS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A post from Pulse Security that examines ways that a compromised
pipeline running on a GitLab shared runner can be used to escape from
its isolation, compromise the shared runner, and then compromise any
other jobs on that runner. The post specifically focuses on the
docker-in-docker executor on GitLab, but many of the techniques
described can be generalized. 

 BUILDING A FREE BURP COLLABORATOR WITH CLOUDFLARE WORKERS (5 MINUTE
READ) [11]

 THE TICKING SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK BOMB OF EXPOSED KUBERNETES SECRETS (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Aqua researchers found exposed Kubernetes secrets in public repos for
hundreds of orgs/projects, including SAP & blockchain firms, posing
severe supply chain attack potential. Secrets enable access to
sensitive SDLC environments. This blog examines inherent Kubernetes
secrets management risks, cases of critical data now exposed, and
potential downstream impact enabling attacks. 

 A TOUCH OF PWN - PART I (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers tested Windows Hello fingerprint sensors on Dell, Lenovo,
and Surface laptops - all with Match-on-Chip. They achieved auth
bypass on all of the laptops using software/hardware sensor attacks
requiring physical access. This post is an interesting read into how
the researchers thought of possible ways to attack and ended up
managing to get through the laptops. 

 REVERSING AWS IAM UNIQUE IDS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This post presents a method to obtain the full ARN of an AWS IAM user
or role from the AWS Unique ID. The method involves adding the Unique
ID as a principal in an S3 bucket policy. If the IAM user or role
still exists, AWS will provide the full ARN in the policy after saving
it.
