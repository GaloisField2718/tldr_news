ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW RAMBO ATTACK STEALS DATA USING RAM IN AIR-GAPPED COMPUTERS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new attack called RAMBO can steal data from highly secure
air-gapped computers by using electromagnetic radiation emitted from
the computer's RAM. This attack allows data transfer rates of up to
1,000 bits per second, making it suitable for stealing small amounts
of data like text, keystrokes, and small files. Mitigation strategies
such as zone restrictions and RAM jamming can help defend against the
RAMBO attack, but they come with additional complexities. 

 LOWE'S EMPLOYEES PHISHED VIA GOOGLE ADS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Malwarebytes detected a phishing campaign targeting Lowe's employees

Ads to have them show up in search results for MyLowesLife. The bogus
domains were then used to steal login credentials from employees.

 YEAR-LONG CAMPAIGN OF MALICIOUS NPM PACKAGES TARGETING ROBLOX USERS
(8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A long-running malware campaign is targeting Roblox developers

 WHAT'S THE WORST PLACE TO LEAVE YOUR SECRETS? (10 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A researcher deployed canary tokens to a variety of different
locations to measure how quickly attackers would find them and attempt
to use them on AWS. Tokens deployed to package managers (npm and PyPi)
and GitHub were accessed within minutes whereas Pastebin, a web
server, and a Docker container took longer. Tokens deployed to GitLab,
BitBucket, S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and a (weak) password-protected
Pastebin were never accessed, suggesting that attackers are not
actively monitoring these resources.
