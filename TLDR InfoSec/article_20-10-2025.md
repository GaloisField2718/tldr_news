 WEBINAR: HOW GROWING COMPANIES CAN SECURE ENDPOINTS AND DEVICES FOR
DISTRIBUTED WORKFORCES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As your company grows, you're forced to deal with more devices, more
tools, and more complexity - often with the same limited resources.

This Wednesday (10/22) [4], DIANA HEALTH'S Director of IT Jacob
McGonigle, SENTINELONE'S Jay Ryerse, and RIPPLING IT GM Anique
Drumright will share practical tips to simplify endpoint management
and strengthen security. You'll learn how to:

 	* Gain complete visibility across distributed endpoints
 	* Strengthen security without adding operational drag
 	* Prove ROI on security investments to leadership

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TWO NEW WINDOWS ZERO-DAYS EXPLOITED IN THE WILD - ONE AFFECTS EVERY
VERSION EVER SHIPPED (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft fixed three actively exploited vulnerabilities as part of
the final Patch Tuesday for Windows 10. One of the vulnerabilities is
a secure boot bypass, whereas the other two are privilege escalation
vulnerabilities. Notably, a vulnerable legacy modem driver could allow
for privilege escalation in every version of Windows. 

 GOOGLE ADS FOR FAKE HOMEBREW, LOGMEIN SITES PUSH INFOSTEALERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at threat hunting company Hunt.io have uncovered a new
malware campaign that uses ClickFix tactics and impersonates popular
software to distribute malware. The campaign uses Google Ads to
impersonate software like Homebrew, LogMeIn, and TradingView and
requests users to copy commands they run in Terminal. The malware then
downloads either Odyssey or AMOS infostealers to harvest credentials. 

 PROSPER DATA BREACH IMPACTS 17.6 MILLION ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Hackers stole personal and financial details belonging to 17.6
million users of the Prosper lending platform, including Social
Security numbers and government IDs. Prosper says attackers took data
from its database but did not access accounts or funds.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HACKING A BANNED CHINESE SECURITY CAMERA (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A security researcher successfully conducted man-in-the-middle
attacks against a banned Chinese security camera, demonstrating that
the device fails to verify certificate signing chains properly and
transmits unencrypted video data over UDP. While these vulnerabilities
are concerning, the real security issue driving the US ban is the
camera's automatic firmware update capability, which could allow
manufacturers to push malicious software updates in the future. The
analysis highlights how even devices with multiple security flaws may
pose their most significant risk through remote update mechanisms that
users cannot control or audit. 

 DEFENDERWRITE: ABUSING WHITELISTED PROGRAMS FOR ARBITRARY WRITES (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Antivirus folders typically block file writes to prevent attacks, but
some whitelisted Windows programs can bypass these restrictions.
DefenderWrite is a tool that identifies which executables can write
files into protected antivirus folders without elevated privileges or
exploits. By scanning all .exe files and testing their capabilities,
the tool reveals weak points in Windows Defender and other major AVs,
showing that even protected folders can be compromised for stealthy
persistence. 

 REVISITING BROWSER CACHE SMUGGLING (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Browser cache smuggling is a technique that abuses how web browsers
store files to sneak malicious code onto victims' systems. The method
leverages browser caching to download files, then uses COM Hijacking
(a way of loading malicious DLLs via Windows registry settings) to
achieve persistent code execution each time the browser starts.
Steganography is also used to hide additional payloads within cached
images, making detection harder. By combining these approaches,
attackers can reliably trigger their code from the browser cache
without external downloads or easily detectable file changes,
bypassing many modern endpoint protections and leaving few obvious
traces.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EVERYONE PROMISES TO REDUCE APPSEC ALERT NOISE. HERE'S HOW SEMGREP
ACTUALLY ACHIEVES IT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 SEMGREP'S AI ISN'T JUST AN API CALL TO AN LLM - IT CONFIDENTLY
HANDLES AROUND 60% OF SAST TRIAGE FOR CUSTOMERS, WITH A 96%
HUMAN-AGREE RATE. THIS MEANS SECURITY TEAMS CAN SPEND ALL OF THEIR
TIME ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER, WITHOUT WORRYING THAT THEY'VE MISSED
OUT ON ANY REAL ISSUES. See how Semgrep compares to competitors. [12] 

 KIEMPOSSIBLE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 KIEMPossible is a Kubernetes Infrastructure Entitlement Management
tool from Palo Alto Networks that provides visibility into permissions
and their actual usage across clusters by analyzing RBAC
configurations and audit logs from AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, and
local Kubernetes environments. The tool flattens complex permission
structures into granular entries, correlates them with audit logs to
identify last usage timestamps, and stores the results in a MySQL
database to help security teams enforce least privilege by identifying
unused or risky permissions. It supports workload identity mapping and
group inheritance tracking and generates reports on entities with
dangerous unused permissions, making reducing attack surface without
breaking legitimate access easier. 

 KNIGHTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 KNighter is an automated static analysis tool from UIUC that uses
Large Language Models to synthesize custom code checkers by learning
from historical patch commits in C/C++ codebases like the Linux
kernel. The tool employs a three-stage pipeline of generation,
refinement, and triage to create LLVM-based checkers that identify bug
patterns, focusing on finding real-world vulnerabilities in
large-scale systems. It integrates with OpenAI, Claude, Google, and
DeepSeek models to automatically generate static analysis rules from
git commit history, enabling security teams to discover previously
unknown bugs based on patterns from past fixes. 

 FUZZFORGE AI (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 AI-powered workflow automation and AI Agents platform for AppSec,
Fuzzing, and Offensive Security. Automate vulnerability discovery with
intelligent fuzzing, AI-driven analysis, and a marketplace of security

 EUROPOL DISMANTLES SIM FARM NETWORK POWERING 49 MILLION FAKE ACCOUNTS
WORLDWIDE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Europol's Operation SIMCARTEL dismantled a sophisticated
cybercrime-as-a-service platform that operated SIM farms with 40,000
active SIM cards, enabling the creation of over 49 million fake online
accounts used for phishing, investment fraud, and other criminal
activities. The operation resulted in seven arrests, seizure of 1,200
SIM box devices, takedown of two websites, and freezing of nearly
€700,000 in assets across multiple countries. Security professionals
should monitor for SIM farm indicators in their threat detection
systems and implement stronger verification processes that go beyond
SMS-based authentication, as these operations demonstrate how easily
criminals can bypass phone number verification on a massive scale. 

 NORTH KOREAN HACKERS COMBINE BEAVERTAIL AND OTTERCOOKIE INTO ADVANCED
JS MALWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign
have merged functionality from their BeaverTail and OtterCookie
malware families, creating a more sophisticated JavaScript-based
information stealer with enhanced keylogging, screenshot capture, and
cryptocurrency wallet theft capabilities. The evolved malware uses
legitimate npm packages and supply chain compromises to distribute
through fake job interview processes, with new variants like
OtterCandy combining remote access trojan functionality and utilizing
blockchain-based command-and-control infrastructure via Ethereum and
BNB Smart Chain. Security professionals should monitor for suspicious
npm packages, implement stronger validation for job applicant
technical assessments, and watch for the specific malware indicators,
including the "node-nvm-ssh" package and associated file patterns used
in these supply chain attacks. 

 VANILLA TEMPEST'S RHYSIDA RANSOMWARE ATTACKS FOILED (1 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Microsoft dismantled an attack campaign by Vanilla Tempest (also
called Vice Society), which used fake Microsoft Teams installers and
over 200 fraudulent certificates to spread the Rhysida ransomware. The
attackers used malicious ads and SEO techniques to lure users,
delivering malware that enabled data theft and additional payload
delivery.
