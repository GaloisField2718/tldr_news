STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CONFIGURE GITHUB ARTIFACT ATTESTATION FOR SECURE CLOUD-NATIVE
DELIVERY (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Now that Artifact Attestation is generally available, GitHub has
published a walkthrough on how to use it. GitHub created the
attest-build-provenance action, which can be added to a workflow to
add an Attestation to a built artifact. GitHub also released a
Kubernetes admission controller, which can be deployed in clusters to
verify artifacts' attestations before deployment. 

 REDHUNT LABS INTRODUCES CUTTING-EDGE ‚ÄúINTERACTIVE ATTACK SURFACE
GRAPH‚Äù; EMPOWERS ENHANCED REACHABILITY ANALYSIS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 RedHunt Labs has introduced the Interactive Attack Surface Graph for
cybersecurity management. The tool provides visual insights to
identify threats and vulnerabilities efficiently. Similar graph-based
tools can empower security teams to make informed decisions and
protect digital assets effectively. 

 FORMALLY VERIFYING SECURITY PROPERTIES OF CHERI PROCESSORS (4 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Researchers used a new verification framework, VeriCHERI, to find and
fix a vulnerability in a processor vulnerable to Meltdown-style
attacks. VeriCHERI focuses on security properties rather than
conforming to a specification, making it effective in detecting
vulnerabilities like timing side channels. This approach enhances
security verification for processors like CHERIoT Ibex, improving
protection against attacks exploiting microarchitectural weaknesses.

a lower-privileged insider to undermine the integrity and isolation
assumptions made by the Homebrew CI/CD.
