 ATTACKERS AREN'T CHASING CVES. ARE YOU? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Agent-based scanners and legacy approaches have failed to keep up
with real-world attacks, creating a false sense of security while
missing exposures that are actively being exploited. And they fail to
protect unmanageable and unknown assets…

So while you're chasing CVEs and playing alert whack-a-mole, attackers
are probing for exposures they can exploit right now.

runZero [4] eliminates dangerous blind spots, providing internal and
external attack surface visibility across IT, OT, IoT, mobile, and
cloud. Using advanced fingerprinting and novel discovery techniques
[5] (no agents or authentication required), runZero uncovers exposures
that others miss, and prioritizes what actually matters.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW NPM ATTACK POISONS LOCAL PACKAGES WITH BACKDOORS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Researchers at Reversing Labs identified two malicious packages on
npm targeting the ‘ethers' package: ‘ethers-provider2' and
‘ethers-providerz.' These packages stand out because they download a
secondary malware stage that monitors the legitimate ‘ethers'
package, then swaps its ‘provider-jsonrpc.js' with a trojanized
version. This trojanized file downloads a third-stage malware that
creates a reverse shell to a malicious IP address. Reversing Labs
emphasizes the severity of this issue, as removing the malicious
package does not eliminate the risk since the trojanized legitimate
package can still harbor the malware. 

 NEW ATLANTIS AIO AUTOMATES CREDENTIAL STUFFING ON 140 SERVICES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Abnormal Security have discovered a new Credential
Stuffing as a Service (CSaaS) called Atlantis AIO. Atlantis AIO can
automate the process of account takeovers via brute forcing,
credential stuffing, or abusing account recovery with pre-built
integrations for 140 services. It also aids threat actors in bypassing
CAPTCHAs and monetizing stolen credentials/accounts. 

 MACOS USERS WARNED OF NEW VERSIONS OF READERUPDATE MALWARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 ReaderUpdate macOS malware loader has evolved to other languages such
as Go and Rust. Initially a Python binary, it targets x86 Intel
systems through third-party software sites, deploying adware and
potentially serving as a pay-per-install platform for threat actors.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SCALING THREAT MODELING WITH AI: GENERATING 1,000 THREAT MODELS USING
GEMINI 2.0 AND AI SECURITY ANALYZER (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post presents a method to produce high-quality threat
models using Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and a series of prompts. The
author found that the LLM performed poorly with prompts that were too
long or too short but found that they could use multiple prompts that
are in a “sweet spot” of length to science the desired results.
They then used GitHub Actions to queue repositories into a pipeline
that their AI Security Analyzer could then generate security design
documentation, threat modeling, attack surface, and attack tree
analysis for. 

 HOW TO HACK AN EIGHT SLEEP SMART MATTRESS “POD” (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Security researcher Dylan Ayrey identified three key vulnerabilities
in Eight Sleep's "Pod" mattress: a developer backdoor for SSH access,
an exposed AWS key, and dependence on cloud services. He replaced the
$4,700 hub with a $150 aquarium chiller, demonstrating a simpler
solution for temperature control that avoided data collection and
internet access, instead of relying on a $200-300 annual subscription.


 DO YOU OWN YOUR PERMISSIONS, OR DO YOUR PERMISSIONS OWN YOU? (6
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The article discusses how BloodHound Enterprise addressed false
positives in Active Directory attack paths due to object ownership
permissions. It explains how Microsoft's BlockOwnerImplicitRights
feature prevents compromised accounts from altering security
descriptors to elevate privileges. The author details the
implementation of OwnsLimitedRights and WriteOwnerLimitedRights edges
in BloodHound v7.1.0, which correctly identify when these features are
active, reducing false positives for users blocking owner implicit
rights.

 HOW THREAT ACTORS GET THEIR NAMES (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Many threat actors are recognized by various names. These
designations vary based on different vendors' conventions, such as
Crowdstrike's use of animal names and Mandiant's APT classifications.
This post features a list of threat actor names publicly disclosed by
Microsoft, as well as additional names they are recognized by. 

 A SNEAKY PHISH JUST GRABBED TROY HUNT'S MAILCHIMP MAILING LIST (6
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Troy Hunt of Have I Been Pwned recently fell for a phishing email
that claimed his Mailchimp privileges were restricted, redirecting him
to a site that stole his login and MFA code. The email's legitimacy
was convincing, and fatigue combined with Outlook for iOS not
displaying the email address contributed to his error. However,
1Password's lack of autofill should have prevented it. Hunt also
questioned why Mailchimp kept unsubscribed emails and has added the
breached email list to his site. 

 SECURITY ON THE PATH TO AGI (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 OpenAI is enhancing its security posture through a security grant
program, a bug bounty cash increase, and AI-powered defense
