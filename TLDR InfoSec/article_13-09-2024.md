 ADVANCED CYBERCHEF TECHNIQUES - DEFEATING NANOCORE OBFUSCATION WITH
MATH AND FLOW CONTROL (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article walks through the process of deobfuscating a .vbs loader
for Nanocore malware. The deobfuscation begins by using a regex to
filter out comments in the obfuscated loader. It involves
alternatively adding or dividing long decimal numbers with hexadecimal
numbers to obtain char codes that are concatenated to form the code.
The CyberChef script utilizes reflexes and capture groups to isolate
the various components of the obfuscated code followed by Subsections
to handle the alternating mathematical operations. 

 STRATEGIES USED BY ADVERSARIES TO STEAL APPLICATION ACCESS TOKENS (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post is a deep dive into mechanisms for stealing
application access tokens and detection and mitigation strategies. It
begins by exploring how access tokens are used and provides examples
of how to use tools like AADInternals and Peirates along with some
examples of how APTs steal tokens. The post then suggests methods for
detecting access token compromise in Azure and provides a sample query
to run to search for compromise. It provides mitigation techniques
such as auditing logs and specific recommendations for ways to
restrict web-based content on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
