TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-09-02

 43% OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FEWER THAN 5 STAFF MEMBERS HANDLING
COMPLIANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Meanwhile, compliance requirements keep expanding. New regulations
emerge annually across privacy, financial controls, and cyber
resilience. Each framework demands separate audits, evidence
collection, and documentation — even when requirements overlap
significantly [4].

Beyond the obvious resource drain, this creates strategic blind spots
when compliance teams operate in silos, miss shared controls, and
duplicate work across frameworks that share common ground.

This ebook [4] breaks down how organizations are rethinking their
approach to manage expanding compliance obligations without expanding
headcount. Get your free copy [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 S1NGULARITY: SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK LEAKS SECRETS ON GITHUB (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Multiple malicious versions of the popular Nx build system package
were published to NPM on August 26. The attack leveraged AI command
line tools to search for sensitive files, extracted credentials, and
then attempted lockout by appending `sudo shutdown -h 0` to .bashrc
and .zshrc files. The root cause of the supply chain attack was a
flawed GitHub Action that allowed code injection through unsanitized
PR titles combined with the `pull_request_target` trigger. 

 GOOGLE WARNS THAT MASS DATA THEFT HITTING SALESLOFT AI AGENT HAS
GROWN BIGGER (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The data theft affecting Drift AI, a Salesloft tool, is more
extensive than initially reported. Attackers used compromised
credentials to access Google Workspace emails, and as a result, all
Salesloft Drift integrations are now considered potentially
compromised. Organizations must revoke and rotate all connected
credentials and check for unauthorized access. 

 FRAUDSTER STOLE OVER $1.5 MILLION FROM CITY OF BALTIMORE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A fraudster stole $1.5 million from Baltimore between February and
March by pretending to be a vendor employee, hacking into the vendor's
Workday account, and convincing AP staff to redirect bank details. The
city recovered $721,000, but cannot recover $803,000 despite insurance
claims and reissued payments. This is Baltimore's third instance of
vendor fraud since 2019, highlighting ongoing weaknesses in financial
controls following losses of $62,000 in 2019 and $376,000 in 2022.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RAGE AGAINST THE AUTHENTICATION STATE MACHINE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers discovered an authentication bypass (CVE-2024-28080) in
Gitblit's SSH service that allows attackers to log in without
requiring a user's private key or password, only needing the username
and public key. This post analyzes how the vulnerability arose,
detailing the SSH login handshake and highlighting where the
implementation deviates from secure best practices with Apache MINA
SSHD. 

 CVSS IS BUILT FOR CODE, NOT AI AGENTS. NOW AIVSS CLOSES THE GAP (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional CVSS scores fail to address the unique risks posed by
autonomous AI agents. The new AIVSS framework extends CVSS by
evaluating behavioral factors—such as autonomy, tool access, and
memory use—enabling security teams to measure and manage the risks
of agentic AI systems more effectively, aligning with modern security
frameworks like NIST AI RMF. 

 THE RESURGENCE OF IOT MALWARE: INSIDE THE MIRAI-BASED BOTNET CAMPAIGN
(7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Gayfemboy botnet exploits vulnerabilities in DrayTek, TP-Link,
Raisecom, and Cisco devices to deploy a Mirai-variant that uses
modified UPX packing, custom architecture naming schemes, and
hardcoded process termination lists to eliminate competing malware
infections. The malware implements sophisticated evasion techniques,
including 50-nanosecond sandbox delays, utilizes public DNS servers
(1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8) to bypass local filtering, and scans 15 predefined
ports for C2 communication with domains such as cross-compiling[.]org
and i-kiss-boys[.]com. Organizations should implement network
monitoring for unusual DNS queries to public resolvers, deploy IPS
signatures for the listed CVEs, and monitor for processes attempting
to bind to UDP port 47272 or exhibiting the malware's distinctive
process termination behavior.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ENDING THE TURF WAR BETWEEN IT AND INFOSEC (SPONSOR) [11] 

 IT and InfoSec are technically on the same side… but it sometimes
doesn't feel like it. In this 30-minute session [11], you'll learn how
to start working as one team:

 	* Bridge the gap without restoring to passive-aggressive Slack
messages
 	* Align on CVE priorities [11] without losing your cool (or your
uptime)
 	* Create a process both teams can actually follow.

Expect practical advice, a few war stories, and useful tips for better
alignment. You'll also find out how automation and better visibility
can take the sting out of security requests. 

Maybe you can even cut those “hey, did you patch this?” emails in
half…

 CATSNIFFER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 CatSniffer is an original, multiprotocol, and multiband board
designed for sniffing, communicating with, and attacking IoT (Internet
of Things) devices using the latest radio IoT protocols. It is a
highly portable USB stick that integrates TI CC1352, Semtech SX1262,
and an RP2040 for V3 or a Microchip SAMD21E17 for V2. 

 START ACCELERATING SECURE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT (3 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Cortex Cloud ASPM is a prevention-first application security module
that integrates with AppSec tools, such as Snyk, GitLab, and
Checkmarx, to block vulnerabilities before they reach production. The
platform offers automated remediation, inline IDE fixes, and
correlates findings across code, cloud, and runtime to prioritize
risks over false alarms. In early access, with general availability in
H2 2025, it claims to be 10 times faster and more cost-effective than
traditional reactive security. 

 BLOCKEDRTRAFFIC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Two tools written in C that block network traffic for blacklisted EDR
processes, using either Windows Defender Firewall (WDF) or Windows
Filtering Platform (WFP).

 FBI CYBER COP: SALT TYPHOON PWNED 'NEARLY EVERY AMERICAN' (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon has infiltrated U.S. telecoms,
stealing personal data from nearly every American and millions
globally since 2019. FBI officials say the scale and indiscriminate
nature of the campaign are unprecedented, affecting at least 80
countries, 200 U.S. organizations, and high-profile political figures.


 SCARCRUFT USES ROKRAT MALWARE IN OPERATION HANKOOK PHANTOM TARGETING
SOUTH KOREAN ACADEMICS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 North Korean APT37 (ScarCruft) carried out Operation HanKook Phantom
using spear-phishing emails with malicious LNK files disguised as PDFs
to deliver RokRAT malware to South Korean research targets. The attack
utilized fake newsletter lures from the National Intelligence Research
Association, employing PowerShell scripts and fileless techniques to
exfiltrate data via Dropbox, Google Cloud, and Yandex. This campaign
shows APT37's focus on espionage against the South Korean government,
research, and academic targets. 

 WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS TRUMP OFFICIALS COPIED MILLIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A whistleblower at the Social Security Administration (SSA) stated
that a former senior DOGE official, now at the SSA, copied the Social
Security Numbers (SSNs), names, and dates of birth of over 300 million
Americans to a private section of the agency's AWS cloud environment.
The complaint states that the cloud environment was set up for
DOGE-affiliated Social Security staffers but lacks independent
security, monitoring, and oversight. The complaint also alleges that
cybersecurity officials within the SSA described the decision to copy
the data as “very high risk” and discussed the possibility of
having to reissue SSNs in the event of a breach.

 OPENSSH 10.1 WILL WARN THE USER WHEN A NON POST-QUANTUM KEY AGREEMENT
SCHEME IS SELECTED (1 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 OpenSSH 10.1 will warn users when connecting to servers that use
