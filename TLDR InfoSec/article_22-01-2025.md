ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BITBUCKET SERVICES “HARD DOWN” DUE TO MAJOR WORLDWIDE OUTAGE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Atlassian reported a major outage affecting Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud
customers. Impacted services included the website, API, git via HTTPS
and SSH, Webhooks, source downloads, pipelines, git LFS, email
delivery, purchasing and licensing, and signup. Bitbucket has managed
to restore services and disclosed that the issue was due to saturated
database connections. A full postmortem will be published. 

 7-ZIP FIXES BUG THAT BYPASSES WINDOWS MOTW SECURITY WARNINGS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 7-Zip has released a patch for a vulnerability that could allow
maliciously crafted archives to bypass Windows MotW protection. Mark
of the Web (MotW) is a flag that alerts users and the operating system
that a file may have come from an untrusted source and prompts for
permission before running. In this vulnerability, 7-Zip failed to
propagate the MotW from the archive to the extracted files. 

 WINDOWS BITLOCKER - SCREWED WITHOUT A SCREWDRIVER (27 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 This blog post discusses how to exploit a vulnerability in
BitLocker-encrypted Windows systems through a bootloader downgrade and
Secure Boot bypass. By downgrading the bootloader, attackers can gain
full read/write access to the encrypted disk without changing the
target system. The exploit highlights the importance of Secure Boot
and the potential risks associated with default BitLocker
configurations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UNSAFE ARCHIVE UNPACKING: LABS AND SEMGREP RULES (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Archive Path Traversal is a vulnerability that can occur when
extracting an archive file if the implementation does not properly
check that filename sequences don't exit the archive (ex: ../../evil).
An intern at Doyensec created a project that provides Semgrep rules as
well as a playground with various malicious archive files and
vulnerable implementations to demonstrate this vulnerability. The post
concludes by discussing path sanitization and path validation as
possible mitigations. 

 UNIQUE 0-CLICK DEANONYMIZATION ATTACK TARGETING SIGNAL, DISCORD, AND
HUNDREDS OF PLATFORMS (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An attacker discovered a method to find a person's location within a
250-mile radius through a unique 0-click deanonymization attack on
platforms like Signal and Discord. By exploiting Cloudflare caching,
the attacker could pinpoint a target's location by causing them to
load a resource that gets cached in a local datacenter. While
Cloudflare patched the bug, the attack shows how infrastructure
designed for performance can be used for tracking, highlighting
ongoing risks for users. 

 SUMMITING THE PYRAMID: BRING THE PAIN WITH ROBUST AND ACCURATE
DETECTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Summiting the Pyramid introduces a methodology to score analytics for
robust detection against adversary behavior, aiming to make it harder
for adversaries to hide. The framework helps defenders build accurate
and resistant detections using a combination of specificity and
exclusion criteria. It also provides guidance on creating robust
detections for both host-based and network data.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EVILKNIEVELNOVNC (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 EvilKnievelnoVNC can be used for scalable and semi-automated
MFA-phishing through a "browser-in-the-middle" approach. It includes
features like concurrent sessions, victim-specific URLs, and real-time
monitoring. Users are advised to use the tool responsibly, customize
settings, and conduct tests before usage. 

 CYBERBRO (WEB APP) [12] 

 Cyberbro is a user-friendly application for checking the reputation
of online observables like IP addresses and URLs. It integrates with
multiple services like VirusTotal and Google Safe Browsing to provide
detailed reports efficiently. Users can easily deploy Cyberbro using
Docker and customize it with API keys from different services. 

 GLIBC_HEAP_EXPLOITATION_TRAINING (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This GitHub repository offers resources for a glibc Malloc heap
exploitation course by Maxwell Dulin and Security Innovation. It
includes free videos, slides, and exercises for learning about heap
exploitation. The training covers various techniques and modules.

 3 TAKEAWAYS FROM RED TEAMING 100 GENERATIVE AI PRODUCTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Microsoft founded its AI red team in 2018 to address the growing
landscape of AI security and threats. Generative AI systems can be
vulnerable to both existing/traditional security vulnerabilities as
well as novel ones. Humans will be necessary to augment Generative AI
systems with subject matter expertise, emotional intelligence, and
cultural context. Both technical and nontechnical, defense-in-depth
approaches will be necessary to protect Generative AI systems. 

 PRODUCT SECURITY BAD PRACTICES (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A list from CISA of product security bad practices for software
manufacturers with recommendations on how to fix the issues. The first
set of product practices focuses on using memory-unsafe languages,
usage of default or hardcoded credentials, usage of dependencies with
critical vulnerabilities, and unsafe cryptography. The second set
focuses on security practices such as supporting MFA and providing
access to logs that would enable intrusion detection. The last set
focuses on organizational practices such as having a VDP and
publishing CVEs and EoL timelines. 

 MALICIOUS EXTENSIONS CIRCUMVENT GOOGLE'S REMOTE CODE BAN (19 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This blog post discusses how malicious extensions found ways to hide
their harmful functions in Chrome Web Store, despite Google's
restrictions. Several extensions, like Phoenix Invicta and Sweet VPN,
were discovered using obfuscated code and accessing sensitive data.
Domain names associated with these malicious extensions were
identified, hinting at potential spying and fraud activities.
