 WEBINAR: HOW REDDIT MATURED ACCESS MANAGEMENT WITH
1PASSWORD (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Poorly-managed passwords are the #1 cause of breaches, and they leave
IT teams struggling with fragmented access management and manual
onboarding/offboarding processes. Reddit was dealing with all these
challenges, plus a compromised security vendor. They needed a solution
that reduced credential risk without slowing down their employees.

In this webinar, Reddit's Sr. Manager of Enterprise Security &
Systems, Nick Fohs, shares the inside story of how his team used
1Password to manage credentials across the entire company. You'll get
a first-hand look at the problems they faced, and the impact 1Password
has had on security and efficiency. [4]

 HYUNDAI AUTOEVER AMERICA DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS, DRIVERS LICENSES
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hyundai AutoEver America, which provides IT services for Hyundai and
Kia affiliates, reported a data breach. The breached data includes
names, SSNs, and driver's licenses. The disclosure did not state
whether the breach only included employee data or also included
customer data. 

 MALICIOUS ANDROID APPS ON GOOGLE PLAY DOWNLOADED 42M TIMES (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Researchers from Zscaler report that an estimated 239 malicious apps
were downloaded 42 million times from the Google Play Store between
June 2024 and May 2025. Zscaler noted a 67% year-over-year growth in
malware targeting mobile devices during this period. Zscaler has
identified three malware families that had a notable impact on Android
users: the Asta banking trojan, the Android Void Android TV backdoor,
and the Xnotice RAT. 

 400,000 WORDPRESS SITES AFFECTED BY ACCOUNT TAKEOVER VULNERABILITY IN
POST SMTP WORDPRESS PLUGIN (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Over 400,000 WordPress sites are at risk due to a severe
vulnerability in the Post SMTP plugin, which allows hackers to view
password reset emails and potentially take over accounts. Exploitation
is already underway. Users must urgently update to version 3.6.1 to
prevent their site from being compromised.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CREDENTIALS AND MISCONFIGURATIONS BEHIND MOST CLOUD BREACHES, SAYS
AWS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The 'Building Cloud Trust" report by AWS and Vanson Bourne surveyed
2,800 organizations across 13 countries, revealing that about 80%
experienced data breaches in the past year, with common attack vectors
including vulnerability exploitation, compromised credentials,
misconfigurations, and physical theft. Attackers are increasingly
using stolen credentials through methods like VPN/VDI abuse,
AI-enabled phishing, and legitimate tool exploitation, with a
predicted shift toward targeting non-human identities protected by
single-factor authentication. To combat these threats, security teams
should focus on cloud security posture management, adopt
phishing-resistant MFA, enforce least privilege access, and prioritize
patching internet-facing infrastructure, while acknowledging human
error as a primary cause. 

 BREAKING INTO GITLAB: ATTACKING AND DEFENDING SELF-HOSTED CI/CD
ENVIRONMENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers can abuse globally scoped GitLab instance runners to
execute arbitrary code and pivot into cloud environments if runners
are configured with shell executors and attached IAM roles. Once a
runner is compromised, the attackers can scrape build artifacts and
environment files to steal secrets, SSH keys, or cloud credentials.
Strategic defense centers on eliminating global runners, enforcing
containerized job isolation, tightening IAM role scoping, and
restricting access to the GitLab instance to reduce blast radius. 

 WINDOWS INTERNALS: SECURE CALLS - THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE NT KERNEL
AND SECURE KERNEL (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Secure Calls are a mechanism in Windows that allows the “regular”
(NT) kernel, residing in virtual trust level (VTL) 0, to communicate
with the secure kernel (SK) operating in VTL 1. Secure calls are
implemented as a hypercall with the hypervisor brokering the
connection. In this post, the author reverse-engineers the secure call
process and structure and introduces a tool for making secure calls
with user-supplied arguments.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TEXAS A&M SAVED $7M WITH VECTRA AI — SEE HOW IT WORKS IN REAL TIME
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 When cloud, identity, and network tools operate in silos, they can't
stop fast-moving attacks. Vectra AI's Attack Signal Intelligence™
connects the dots for faster MTTD, fewer false positives, and stronger
SOC performance. See how in the Best Practices Guide: How to Test an
NDR Solution Effectively [12]. Want to experience it firsthand? Book a
demo [11]. 

 CURL-IMPERSONATE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 curl-impersonate is a special build of curl that can impersonate
Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox. 

 UNDELETE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This tool recovers deleted NPM packages by querying five registries
(npmjs.org, cnpmjs.org, npmmirror.com, huaweicloud.com, and
tencent.com) to download 1-20 recent versions with metadata, including
usernames, emails, and maintainer information, utilizing auto-retries
and security filtering. Security researchers can retrieve discontinued
malicious packages for malware analysis and threat intelligence.
Features include custom output, silent mode with JSON, and no external
dependencies, making deployment easy. Teams use this for post-incident
recovery, building malware collections, and investigating suspicious
packages that have been quickly removed from NPM. 

 MALANTA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Malanta is a cybersecurity startup that utilizes AI to detect digital
traces left by attackers during their attack setup, forecasting, and
dismantling malicious infrastructure before attacks occur. Its
technology provides warning in advance and proactive defense for
clients.

 HOW THE F5 BREACH, CISA JOB CUTS, AND A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ARE
ERODING US CYBER READINESS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A China-linked breach of F5's BIG-IP software exposed source code and
undisclosed vulnerabilities, creating a path for custom exploits
against critical infrastructure and government networks. At the same
time, significant workforce cuts at CISA and a federal shutdown are
degrading incident response capacity, election protection efforts, and
national coordination. Security teams should assume reduced federal
support and prioritize proactive hardening, continuous monitoring, and
supply chain risk management across high-impact edge and network
devices. 

 CYBERSOCEVAL: BENCHMARKING LLMS CAPABILITIES FOR MALWARE ANALYSIS AND
THREAT INTELLIGENCE REASONING (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Researchers from Meta and CrowdStrike introduced the open-source
CyberSOCEval benchmark to assess large language models (LLMs) on two
critical SOC tasks: malware analysis and threat intelligence
reasoning. Technical findings show that current models score only
~15-28% on malware analysis and 43-53% on threat-intelligence
reasoning, highlighting significant gaps in interpreting JSON logs,
mapping attack chains to MITRE ATT&CK, and reasoning about multi-hop
adversaries. Security teams should be cautious about off-the-shelf LLM
reliance, instead using these benchmarks to validate models, augment
human analysts rather than replace them, and prioritize training with
domain-specific cyber data. 

 META IS EARNING A FORTUNE ON A DELUGE OF FRAUDULENT ADS (3 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Internal documents from late last year predicted that Meta would earn
about 10% of its overall annual revenue ($16 billion) from fraudulent
ads. Meta's automated system only bans advertisers if it is 95%
certain that the ads are malicious. Otherwise, the advertisers are
simply charged a higher rate. Documents also show that users who click
on these scams or malicious ads are more likely to see them in the
future.
