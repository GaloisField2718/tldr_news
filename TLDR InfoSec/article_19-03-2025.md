components and trust boundaries, documents threat scenarios of
potential adversary exploitations, and generates actionable findings
with short- and long-term mitigation recommendations. It addresses
root causes at the architecture level, allowing clients to adapt their
threat models as systems evolve and offering vital security insights
throughout the software development lifecycle.
