TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2026-01-22

 YOUR TEAM CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALERT VOLUME. AI SOC AGENTS CAN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Hiring can't solve this. Training takes too long. Analysts burn out
and quit. Meanwhile, critical alerts pile up while your team wastes
time on false positives.

SOC teams using AI SOC analysts to handle alert overload:

	* Indiana Farm Bureau: 75% less manual work
	* Assala Energy: 70% fewer false positives, 5X faster
	* CBTS: 50% more alert volume, zero new hires

AI agents cut investigations from 25 minutes to 3-10 minutes. 10X
capacity, same team.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VULNERABILITIES THREATEN TO BREAK CHAINLIT AI FRAMEWORK (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Zafran Security disclosed two high-severity vulnerabilities in
Chainlit, an open-source AI chatbot framework with over 200,000 weekly
PyPI downloads. CVE-2025-22218 (CVSS 7.7) enables arbitrary file reads
via the custom elements API, while CVE-2026-21219 (CVSS 7.0) is an
SSRF flaw affecting SQLAlchemy implementations. Combined exploitation
could allow attackers to steal AWS credentials from EC2 instances
running IMDSv1 and achieve cloud account takeover. Version 2.9.4
patches both vulnerabilities. 

 CLOUDFLARE WHACKS WAF BYPASS BUG THAT OPENED SIDE DOOR FOR ATTACKERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cloudflare has fixed a vulnerability in its WAF that could allow
attackers to bypass security rules and directly access origin servers.
The vulnerability emerged when Cloudflare disabled security features
upon receiving an HTTP-01 ACME challenge without verifying that the
challenge token was valid. Cloudflare remediated this issue with no
customer action by disabling WAF features only when the challenge
token matches a legitimate token for that domain. 

 PROMPT INJECTION BUGS FOUND IN OFFICIAL ANTHROPIC GIT MCP SERVER (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cyata discovered three prompt-injection vulnerabilities in
Anthropic's reference MCP server for the git implementation. The
vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when
the MCP server is used alongside a filesystem MCP, delete arbitrary
files, and load arbitrary files into an LLM's context. They arise from
mcp-server-git failing to properly validate repository paths or
sanitize arguments passed to Git commands.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT HUNTING WITH CLAUDE CODE AND MCP (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This guide demonstrates how to use Claude Code with Model Context
Protocol servers to compress days of manual threat hunting into hours
by connecting AI agents directly to security data lakes for
hypothesis-driven investigations. The workflow involves stakeholder
alignment on three to five priority threats from threat models, then
deploying reusable "Skills" that teach agents hunting methodologies,
such as the pivot loop pattern for correlating indicators across time,
identity, network, and host dimensions. Hunt outputs include
structured findings with confidence assessments and detection coverage
gaps that translate directly into detection-as-code rules. 

 UNAUTHENTICATED CLUSTER TAKEOVER IN AWS ROSA (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A security researcher discovered a critical vulnerability in the Red
Hat OpenShift Service affecting AWS ROSA Classic clusters that could
allow unauthenticated full cluster takeover. The vulnerability lies in
the cluster transfer endpoint, which checks only whether the recipient
has the ability to accept a cluster, not whether the requester owns
the cluster, allowing an attacker to take over a cluster with only the
cluster_uuid and username. Unauthenticated requests to the cluster's
web console settings endpoint return the cluster_uuid and the owner's
email address, which could be used to guess their username. 

 SDFLGS - THE LOG FIELD I'D BEEN IGNORING THAT UNLOCKED ATTACK PATH
DETECTION (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SDFlags is a field that controls which security descriptor
information is returned in queries and is used extensively in
BloodHound and SharpHound. Querying for nTSecurityDescriptor fields
(Owner, Group, DACL, or SACL) opens the door to attack path mapping.
Conversely, legitimate tools almost never set SDFlags when running AD
queries, opening up a new detection opportunity.

 INTRODUCING SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK CAMPAIGNS TRACKING IN THE SOCKET
DASHBOARD (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Socket launched a Threat Intel page with campaign tracking that
identifies whether organizations are affected by active supply chain
attack campaigns targeting package registries like npm. The feature
groups related malicious packages under single campaigns (such as
Shai-Hulud and Contagious Interview), displays Safe/Impacted status
for each organization, and provides direct links to affected
repositories with ecosystem filtering for npm, PyPI, and Maven.
Security teams can immediately assess exposure to coordinated attacks
without cross-referencing advisories or running custom scripts.

MISCELLANEOUS

 HONG KONG ISSUES CODE OF PRACTICE UNDER THE PROTECTION OF CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURES (COMPUTER SYSTEMS) ORDINANCE (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Hong Kong's Office of the Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure
issued a Code of Practice on January 1 that translated the Protection
of Critical Infrastructures Ordinance into specific compliance
requirements for critical infrastructure operators. The CoP
establishes criteria for Critical Computer System designation
(including SCADA and industrial control systems), defines material
change notification triggers, mandates security audits and management
plans, and clarifies incident reporting timelines—12 hours for
serious incidents affecting service levels or causing data breaches,
and 48 hours for other security incidents. Critical infrastructure
operators should treat the CoP as the operative compliance benchmark
and implement structured governance programs aligned with its
technical baselines, security audit requirements, and incident
response protocols to meet supervisory expectations. 

 A NOVEL SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACK THAT UTILIZES MEMORY RE-ORDERINGS (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Memory DisOrder is a timerless side-channel attack that exploits
memory re-orderings in relaxed memory models to infer cross-process
activity on mainstream CPUs (X86/Arm/Apple) and GPUs
(NVIDIA/AMD/Apple). The technique demonstrated covert channels
achieving up to 16 bits/second with 95% accuracy on Apple M3 GPU,
reliable DNN architecture fingerprinting, and potential throughput of
nearly 30K bits/second on X86 CPUs when exploiting low-level system
details. Organizations should monitor for emerging mitigations as this
vulnerability class, which affects parallel processing units, becomes
better understood. 

 PHISHING CAMPAIGN ZEROES IN ON LASTPASS CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 An ongoing phishing campaign targeting LastPass customers began
around January 19, using LLM-crafted emails with plausible subject
lines urging users to "back up their vaults" before scheduled
maintenance. The phishing emails direct victims to
credential-harvesting sites designed to capture master passwords,
potentially compromising entire password vaults. Organizations should
alert users to verify email sender addresses, enable MFA on password
managers, and report suspicious LastPass-branded emails.
