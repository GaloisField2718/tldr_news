 NEW RESEARCH: 62% OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DEPLOYED AN AI PACKAGE WITH
AT LEAST ONE CVE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Orca Security has published its new State of AI Security Report. This
research report is based on findings from billions of cloud assets
scanned by Orca's agentless cloud security platform [5] on AWS, Azure,
Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.

The report finds that AI adoption rates are high, with 56% of
organizations using AI to develop custom applications ‚Äî but fast
time-to-market is often prioritized over security. The result: risky
misconfigurations and vulnerable AI packages being deployed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DELL INVESTIGATES DATA BREACH CLAIMS AFTER HACKER LEAKS EMPLOYEE INFO
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Dell has announced that it is investigating a data breach after a
hacker posted an alleged data dump to BreachForums. The data breach
contains data of 10k employees' full names, unique identifiers,
employee status, and internal identification strings. Neither Dell nor
the hacker have disclosed how the data was stolen. 

 RESEARCHERS REVEAL CATASTROPHIC SECURITY FLAW IN THE ARC BROWSER (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher has discovered a vulnerability in the Arc
browser that could lead to RCE on other users. The Arc browser has a
feature called Boosts that allows arbitrary CSS and JavaScript to run
and modify websites in users' browsers. The vulnerability arises from
improper ACLs on The Browser Company's Firebase data store, which
allows attackers to apply Boosts to different users' browsers by
changing the user ID that they are attached to. An update has been
pushed and The Browser Company has committed to improving its security
posture. 

 HOW THE NECRO TROJAN INFILTRATED GOOGLE PLAY, AGAIN (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A new version of the Necro Trojan has infected popular apps on Google
Play and unofficial sources, impacting over 100 million devices
worldwide. The malware used obfuscation to evade detection and had the
ability to display ads, download files, and execute JavaScript code.
Google Play removed the malicious loader from affected apps following
reports of the issue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DETECTING SCRIPTBLOCK SMUGGLING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PowerShell Script Block Logging is one of the types of PowerShell
logs that records the content of all script blocks executed within
PowerShell. ScriptBlock Smuggling is a technique whereby an attacker
can hide a malicious script block within a benign script block. This
post tests detections for this attack in a lab environment using a
test script from AtomicRedTeam. The author notes that the full script,
which contains the malicious command, can still be seen in the details
pane and questions the usefulness of this attack. 

 6 TECHNIQUES I USE TO CREATE A GREAT USER EXPERIENCE FOR SHELL
SCRIPTS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This author wrote a script that was praised for its UX to automate
the evaluation steps in a competition. They argue for comprehensive
error handling and input validation with detailed and actionable error
messages, clear and colorful output, detailed progress reporting
without overwhelming the user by using set -x, using set -x and set +x
for fine grained and strategic error handling, making use of platform
specific functionality, and using time stamped file outputs to make
multiple runs easier to compare. Examples of each of these principles
are included in the post. 

 OPEN TO EXPLOITATION: THE SECURITY RISKS OF UNAUTHENTICATED PAGER
NETWORKS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Many critical sectors still use vulnerable pager networks like
POCSAG, which are easily exploited for message injection attacks via
radio frequencies, for emergency communication. These networks lack
encryption, allowing anyone with basic equipment to intercept and
manipulate messages, posing serious security risks in sensitive
environments. This blog post highlights the urgent need for stronger
security measures in these outdated communication systems by
demonstrating how easy it is to spoof messages.
