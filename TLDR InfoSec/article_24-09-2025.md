TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-09-24

 WHY ARE BIG SECURITY VENDORS IGNORING 99% OF COMPANIES? (SPONSOR) [4]


 It's not because cybersecurity is only a problem for Fortune 500s.
It's because these vendors' business models are built on selling
multi-million dollar enterprise licenses. But it doesn't have to be
this way.

With cybercrime hitting businesses of all sizes and industries,
Huntress [4] delivers security for the 99%.

The Huntress Managed Platform [4] is custom-built security for
endpoints, identities, people, and more, all managed for you 24/7, at
a startup-friendly budget. And they'll deliver results like:

✅ 8-min MTTR (EDR) 

✅ 3-min MTTR (ITDR) 

✅ <1% false positives

✅ 98.8% global CSAT score

Wreck hackers, not your security budget.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SHADOWLEAK EXPLOIT EXPOSED GMAIL DATA THROUGH CHATGPT AGENT (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 ShadowLeak is a zero-click vulnerability in OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep
Research agent that utilized invisible, indirect prompt injection
commands hidden in emails to exfiltrate Gmail data without user
knowledge. The attack operated entirely on OpenAI's servers using the
agent's browser.open() function call to send stolen data encoded in
Base64 to attacker-controlled URLs, achieving a 100% success rate.
OpenAI fixed the vulnerability in August after receiving a responsible
disclosure, but researchers warn that the technique could also be used
on other connected services, such as Google Drive, Microsoft Teams,
and GitHub. 

 LASTPASS: FAKE PASSWORD MANAGERS INFECT MAC USERS WITH MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There is a malware campaign that uses GitHub repositories to deliver
fraudulent password managers. The fake software delivers the Atomic
(AMOS) InfoStealer to infected macOS devices. LastPass says that aside
from its product, over 100 different softwares are being used, such as
1Password and Notion. 

 PATCH BYPASSED FOR SUPERMICRO VULNERABILITY ALLOWING BMC HACK (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binarly researchers found they could bypass Supermicro's patch for
CVE-2024-10237, a firmware flaw allowing malicious updates, prompting
a new CVE (CVE-2025-7937) and fix. They also discovered CVE-2025-6198,
a flaw that bypasses the Root of Trust. Both enable attackers to
control the BMC and OS. These flaws show firmware validation's
fragility, risking persistent BMC code execution with major enterprise
security implications.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A TAG TO RULE THEM ALL: USING AWS TAGS TO ENUMERATE CLOUD RESOURCES
(10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS tags offer a way to attach metadata to a resource, either
automatically (like the Name tag) or manually. Several services
provide API calls such as ListTags or GetTags, enabling efficient
enumeration of resources accessible by an identity. TagNabIt is a tool
designed for tag-based brute-force enumeration. 

 EXPLORING GRAPHENEOS SECURE ALLOCATOR: HARDENED MALLOC (22 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 GrapheneOS features a hardened malloc, a memory allocator that uses
ARM Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) to assign tags to memory regions
and detect corruption, effectively preventing heap overflows and
use-after-free attacks. Its two-stage quarantine system, which
involves randomized and FIFO queues, makes exploiting freed memory
difficult by requiring attackers to perform thousands of free
operations. Large allocations are secured through guard pages, address
space randomization, and the separation of metadata from user data,
all of which enhance security. 

 EXTERNAL ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT (EASM) BUYER'S GUIDE (11 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 External Attack Surface Management (EASM) tools automate the
discovery and continuous monitoring of internet-facing assets,
providing organizations with an attacker's perspective of their
vulnerabilities across domains, IP addresses, and exposed services.
The strategic value lies in combining automated asset discovery with
risk prioritization—EASM products excel at identifying shadow IT,
abandoned subdomains, and misconfigurations that traditional internal
scanning misses. Organizations should select EASM solutions based on
their specific needs: small businesses require clear remediation
guidance, SMEs need robust subdomain discovery to prevent takeovers,
and enterprises benefit from large-scale IP scanning with export
capabilities for distributed security teams.

 AMERICAN ARCHIVE OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING FIXES BUG EXPOSING RESTRICTED
MEDIA (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A vulnerability in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting
website, which has been exploited since at least 2021, allowed
unauthorized downloading of protected and private media through an
insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw that bypassed access
controls by manipulating media ID parameters. The exploit circulated
in Discord preservation communities and "data hoarder" groups, leading
to leaks of protected content, including a banned Sesame Street
episode featuring the Wicked Witch of the West. AAPB fixed the
vulnerability within 48 hours after being notified. The extent of
accessed content during the years-long exploitation remains unknown. 

 U.S. SECRET SERVICE DISMANTLES IMMINENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS THREAT IN
NEW YORK TRISTATE AREA (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The US Secret Service (USSS) dismantled a network of over 300
co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards positioned within 35
miles of the UN General Assembly in New York that were used to conduct
telecommunications-related threats against senior US government
officials. The devices were capable of performing multiple attack
vectors, including disabling cell phone towers, facilitating denial of
service attacks, and enabling anonymous encrypted communications
between nation-state threat actors and criminal enterprises. Early
forensic analysis revealed cellular communications between
nation-state threat actors and individuals known to federal law
enforcement, representing an imminent threat to protective operations
during the high-profile international gathering. 

 WHEN LLMS AUTONOMOUSLY ATTACK (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A researcher at Carnegie Mellon University demonstrated that an LLM
can coordinate a system of agents to recreate real-world attacks. As
part of his PhD, Brian Singer recreated the network environment of the
2017 Equifax data breach and observed that an LLM could replicate the
attack. These capabilities allow smaller organizations to use LLMs as
dedicated red teamers.
