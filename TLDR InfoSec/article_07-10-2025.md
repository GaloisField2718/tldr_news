 A REFRESHINGLY SIMPLE APPROACH TO APPLICATION ALLOWLISTING (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Hackers love when companies abandon Application Allowlisting. It's
“too complicated,” “too hard to implement,” “our apps will
break.”

ThreatLocker® [4] kills the excuses with two simple ingredients:

🧐 LEARNING MODE auto-builds allowlists so you can lock down
endpoints without breaking workflows. When something new gets blocked,
users request access, and admins can approve in seconds, not hours
[4].

🛣️ RINGFENCING™ forces app to stay in their lane. Word can't
spawn scripts. Browsers can't reach network shares. Attackers can't
hijack the tools you already trust.

 Instead of false starts and abandoned Zero Trust projects, you get a
solution CISOs can live with, and auditors love.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ORACLE SECURITY ALERT ADVISORY - CVE-2025-61882 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Oracle issued an emergency security alert for CVE-2025-61882, a
critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle E-Business
Suite that can be exploited over the network without authentication
credentials. The vulnerability is already being actively exploited by
threat actors. Oracle has discovered specific indicators of
compromise, including IP addresses, command-line payloads, and file
hashes associated with exploitation attempts. The IOCs reference
exploit tools with naming conventions suggesting involvement by groups
such as Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, and CL0P, indicating that this
vulnerability is being weaponized by ransomware and extortion groups
for immediate attacks. 

 UNITY HAS FOUND A SECURITY VULNERABILITY THAT HAS SAT DORMANT FOR
ALMOST A DECADE: ‘TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROTECT YOUR GAMES &
APPS' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unity warns developers about a vulnerability identified since version
2017.1 that exposes users to unsafe file loading and local file
inclusion attacks, varying by OS. Developers need to either recompile
and redistribute their apps to fix this issue or use a patching tool
that applies updates without recompilation. However, this tool does
not support Linux builds or applications with tamper-proofing or
anti-cheat features enabled. 

 RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON OHIO COUNTY IMPACTS OVER 45K RESIDENTS,
EMPLOYEES (1 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ransomware attackers stole data in a cyberattack on Union County in
Ohio, impacting 45k of the county's 71k residents. The stolen data
includes Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial
account information, fingerprint data, medical information, and
passport numbers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PHOENIX: ROWHAMMER THAT WORKS ON DDR5 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Phoenix is a Rowhammer attack that bypasses DDR5 protections by
reverse-engineering Target Row Refresh (TRR) and exploiting timing
windows where defenses weaken. The attack uses dummy memory accesses
to trick TRR before executing targeted strikes that can read/write
arbitrary memory, steal RSA keys, or escalate Linux privileges within
5 seconds to 7 minutes. It demonstrates that DDR5's protections can
still be evaded by sophisticated timing attacks that manipulate memory
through carefully crafted access patterns. 

 MCP TOOLS: ATTACK VECTORS AND DEFENSE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AUTONOMOUS
AGENTS (26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Elastic Security Labs provides a comprehensive overview of different
attacks and defenses for MCP tools. Elastic provides a prompt for an
LLM to detect malicious functions in an MCP server, covering security
risks ranging from traditional vulnerabilities to tool poisoning,
orchestration injection, rug-pull redefinitions, name collisions, and
passive influence. Elastic recommends that users utilize sandboxed
environments for MCP, adhere to the principle of least privilege,
restrict MCP servers to only trusted sources, require human approval
for sensitive operations, and monitor all prompts and code. 

 IMDS ABUSED: HUNTING RARE BEHAVIORS TO UNCOVER EXPLOITS (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Wiz Research developed a data-driven threat hunting methodology to
detect anomalous Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) usage by identifying
processes that rarely access IMDS but suddenly query sensitive
endpoints, such as IAM credentials, leading to the discovery of active
exploitation of two zero-day SSRF vulnerabilities. The team uncovered
CVE-2025-51591 in Pandoc (HTML-to-PDF conversion via malicious iframe
tags) and a ClickHouse SSRF vulnerability where attackers abused SQL
"SELECT * FROM url" functions to access cloud metadata services across
AWS and GCP environments. This approach demonstrates how behavioral
anomaly detection can reveal novel attack vectors targeting cloud
infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of enforcing IMDSv2 and
implementing least-privilege access controls to mitigate credential
theft and lateral movement risks.

 TOTOLINK X6000R: THREE NEW VULNERABILITIES UNCOVERED (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 There are three critical vulnerabilities in TOTOLINK X6000R routers
(CVE-2025-52905, CVE-2025-52906, and CVE-2025-52907) that allow
unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands and bypass
security controls via the router's web interface. The vulnerabilities
stem from inadequate input sanitization in the cstecgi.cgi endpoint,
with the blocklist failing to filter hyphen characters, and enabling
argument injection, command injection, and arbitrary file manipulation
attacks. TOTOLINK has released patched firmware
(V9.4.0cu.1498_B20250826). Users are strongly advised to update
immediately as these flaws could allow attackers to gain root access,
intercept traffic, and pivot to other network devices. 

 SIGNAL STATEMENT ON GERMANY (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The latest German Chat Control proposals would require scanning of
every message, photo, and video on a person's device. Signal has
announced that it will discontinue services in Germany, and possibly
across Europe, if these controls are passed, arguing that regardless
of whether messages are scanned before or after encryption, the
controls negate the premises of end-to-end encryption. 

 SCATTERED LAPSUS$ HUNTERS OFFERING $10 IN BITCOIN TO 'ENDLESSLY
HARASS' EXECS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The cybercrime group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is paying individuals
$10 in Bitcoin to pressure executives of alleged breach victims via
email, aiming to coerce them into making ransom payouts. The group,
linked to attacks via a Salesforce integration, published targets'
details and set a payment deadline. Salesforce and Google have stated
that the attacks aren't linked to a compromise of Salesforce itself,
and law enforcement is investigating the gang.
