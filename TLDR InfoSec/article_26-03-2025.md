 THE HIDDEN COSTS OF MANUAL INBOUND SECURITY REVIEWS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Security reviews are often seen as the cost of doing business. But
for many companies, these costs are far higher than they should be due
to slow, manual security processes that hinder operations, inflate
costs, and delay revenue.

requests and inbound security review questionnaires. These often
require coordination across multiple teams (security, GRC, sales,
legal) and endless communication loops.

[9] 

 This post outlines how to measure the success of Adversary Simulation
or Red Teaming exercises, focusing on three key goals: test controls,
defensive enlightenment, and professional courtesy. Test Controls
involves collaboration where testers validate expected security
measures and share findings with defenders to enhance understanding
and improve defenses. Testers should maintain professional courtesy
throughout this process by being available, cleaning up data and
tools, and acting transparently and humbly. 

 CONTINUOUS TRAIL (8 MINUTE READ) [10]

security assumptions, as well as tracking components, sensitive data,
and controls after systems stabilize. This post provides practical
advice for incorporating threat modeling into all SDLC phases,
adapting models to organizational needs, and identifying security
risks early.
