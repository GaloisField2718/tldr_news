 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF THE LATEST VARIANT OF VALLEYRAT (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The ValleyRAT malware uses a multi-stage process involving DLL
sideloading, process injection, and shellcode execution to establish
connections with a command-and-control server for downloading further
malicious payloads. The malware utilizes encryption, decryption, and
hashing algorithms to dynamically load and execute embedded DLLs,
collect system information, and carry out specific actions based on
the victim host's configuration. ValleyRAT conducts device
fingerprinting to gather detailed information about the infected
system, such as IP address, system uptime, hardware details, and user
privileges, aiding in its malicious activities.
