ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PUTTY SSH CLIENT FLAW ALLOWS RECOVERY OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRIVATE KEYS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A vulnerability in PuTTY 0.68-0.80 could allow attackers with access
to 60 cryptographic signatures from a user to compute the private keys
offline. These signatures could come from an attacker-controlled SSH
server or signed git commits. The vulnerability arises from the way
that PuTTY generates ECDSA nonces, which lacks robust cryptographic
random number generators on specific Windows versions. 

 IVANTI WARNS OF CRITICAL FLAWS IN ITS AVALANCHE MDM SOLUTION (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ivanti fixed 27 vulnerabilities in its Avalanche MDM solution,
including critical flaws that allowed remote attackers to execute
commands. These security updates are crucial for protecting over
100,000 mobile devices from potential attacks. It is recommended that
customers update to the latest Avalanche 6.4.3 version to stay secure.


 OPENJS FOUNDATION TARGETED IN POTENTIAL JAVASCRIPT PROJECT TAKEOVER
ATTEMPT (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security researchers discovered a takeover attempt targeting the
OpenJS Foundation similar to a recent incident with the XZ Utils
project. Suspicious emails urged OpenJS to update a JavaScript project
and designate new maintainers without proper involvement. Maintainers
of open-source projects should be cautious of social engineering
attacks targeting their sense of duty and community.

for future deployments. 

 UNRAVELING SIEM CORRELATION TECHNIQUES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post provides an overview of SIEM correlation techniques. It
begins by defining correlation, introducing the MITRE ATT&CK
framework, and presenting an example of a simple correlation rule. The
post then continues to work through an example of detecting a Brute
Force Okta Login, while combining multiple TTPs and log sources.

MISCELLANEOUS

 AWS TOOK 6 MONTHS TO FIX STS BUG - IAM POLICY INADEQUATE (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Stedi discovered a vulnerability in AWS STS that arose from its usage
of IAM role trust policies that relied upon resource tags and request
tags. AWS first denied the issue, then found that the scope of the
problem was larger than initially believed, but still took 6 months to
deploy a fix. A major issue is that the AWS IAM Policy Simulator lacks
many IAM features, which makes it difficult and time consuming to
properly test IAM policies. 

 A QUICK POST ON CHEN'S ALGORITHM (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cryptographer and Professor Matthew Green addresses the new e-print
authored by Yilei Chen, ‚ÄúQuantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems,"
which could potentially threaten current lattice-based encryption
schemes. Despite the significance of this discovery, it may not
immediately affect widely used schemes like Kyber or Dilithium. The
cryptography community is closely monitoring this development for
potential implications for future encryption security. 

 FTC FINES MENTAL HEALTH STARTUP CEREBRAL $7 MILLION FOR MAJOR PRIVACY
VIOLATIONS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The FTC fined Cerebral $7 million for sharing users' sensitive health
data with third parties without consent. Cerebral misled consumers
about its privacy practices and failed to protect their information.
The company must now improve its privacy policies and delete
unnecessary consumer data.
