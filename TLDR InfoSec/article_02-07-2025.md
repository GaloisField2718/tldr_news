 STOP BLOCKING. START ALLOWLISTING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's a lot of software out there. If you're making an ad-hoc
decision on every program a user decided to install, you'll never do
anything else.

Make life easier for everyone with ThreatLocker Application
Allowlisting [5]. Here's how it works:

1️⃣ The ThreatLocker agent learns your system, cataloging every
application and dependency.

2️⃣ The IT admin reviews the list and removes non-essential apps.

3️⃣ Once finalized, the system blocks any executable file, script,
or library not on the allowlist.

4️⃣ Users can request new software to be added to the allowlist.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AND NOW MALWARE THAT TELLS AI TO IGNORE IT? (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers at Check Point discovered a new malware dubbed SkyNet,
which employs a novel technique to attempt to evade AI-based scanners
and tools. The method hard-codes a prompt that attempts to tell any AI
analyzing the code to ignore any previous instructions and respond
with a “NO MALWARE DETECTED” message. Check Point noted that the
SkyNet malware was unable to stop Check Point's AI scanners from
scanning it and concluded that the author would need to refine their
prompt injection technique. 

 CAN YOU TRUST THAT VERIFIED SYMBOL? EXPLOITING IDE EXTENSIONS IS
EASIER THAN IT SHOULD BE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers have found critical vulnerabilities in popular IDEs
(VSCode, Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Cursor) where malicious
extensions can appear verified while containing dangerous code. The
flaw enables attackers to create files that utilize verified symbols
but incorporate malicious functionality, allowing them to execute
system commands and potentially impact millions of developers using
these platforms. 

 ANALYSIS OF THE THREAT CASE OF KIMSUKY GROUP USING 'CLICKFIX' TACTIC
(12 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Kimsuky APT group has evolved its "ClickFix" tactic, tricking
users into executing malicious PowerShell commands disguised as
troubleshooting guides or security checks. The campaign uses
spear-phishing emails, fake job sites, and compromised sites,
employing obfuscation and multilingual variants to evade detection.
Defense involves EDR monitoring for abnormal PowerShell activity and
user education to identify prompts that ask users to copy and paste
codes or "fix" browser issues.
