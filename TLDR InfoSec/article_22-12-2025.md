ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRACKED SOFTWARE AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS SPREAD COUNTLOADER AND
GACHILOADER MALWARE (5 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 CountLoader 3.2 and GachiLoader malware are spreading via cracked
software sites and 100+ compromised YouTube videos (220K views from 39
accounts), deploying ACR Stealer and Rhadamanthys through multi-stage
attacks. CountLoader uses trojanized Python interpreters that execute
via mshta.exe, create persistence with fake Google scheduled tasks
that run every 30 minutes, detect CrowdStrike Falcon to adapt its
execution, and spread via USB drives. GachiLoader employs Node.js with
novel Vectored Exception Handling PE injection techniques and kills
SecHealthUI.exe to disable Windows Defender. Security teams should
monitor for mshta.exe abuse, suspicious scheduled tasks that mimic
legitimate software, WMI queries for AV detection, and modifications
to system folders that exclude Defender, and implement application
whitelisting to block execution of unauthorized Python interpreters
and Node.js scripts. 

 NEW UEFI FLAW ENABLES PRE-BOOT ATTACKS FROM GIGABYTE, MSI, ASUS,
ASROCK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers from Riot Games discovered a UEFI flaw that could allow
for Direct Memory Access (DMA) capable devices to load before the
operating system. DMA allows for PCIe devices to read and write RAM
without going through the CPU and relies upon IOMMU for protection. A
physically present attacker would need to attach a rogue PCIe device
before boot to exploit this vulnerability. 

 NEW CRITICAL WATCHGUARD FIREBOX FIREWALL FLAW EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WatchGuard is warning users to patch a critical, actively exploited
remote code execution vulnerability in its Firebox firewalls. The
vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write that allows
unauthenticated attackers to execute remote code. Firebox firewalls
are only vulnerable if they are configured to use IKEv2, or in some
circumstances, even if the configuration was deleted.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TP-LINK TAPO C200: HARDCODED KEYS, BUFFER OVERFLOWS AND PRIVACY IN
THE ERA OF AI ASSISTED REVERSE ENGINEERING (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A security researcher documented AI-assisted firmware analysis of
TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras using tools including Grok, GhidraMCP, and
Claude Sonnet 4. They discovered hardcoded SSL private keys that
enabled HTTPS traffic decryption, pre-authentication memory overflows,
integer overflow crashes, and unauthenticated WiFi hijacking,
affecting approximately 25,000 internet-exposed devices. The
vulnerabilities enabled remote attackers to decrypt camera traffic,
crash devices, force connections to malicious networks, and enumerate
nearby WiFi BSSIDs for precise geolocation via Apple's location
services API. TP-Link delayed patching beyond its 90-day commitment
despite being a CVE Numbering Authority, raising concerns about vendor
conflicts of interest when controlling their own vulnerability
disclosure pipeline while marketing low CVE counts as a competitive
advantage. 

 MISTRUSTED ADVISOR: EVADING DETECTION WITH PUBLIC S3 BUCKETS AND
POTENTIAL DATA EXFILTRATION IN AWS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Fog Security discovered three methods to bypass AWS
Trusted Advisor and expose S3 buckets without triggering alerts. The
three methods are to create a bucket policy that denies
s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus, s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock, and
s3:GetBucketAcl. Fog Security coordinated disclosure with AWS, but
noted that it took AWS two attempts to fix the vulnerability and felt
that AWS's communication downplayed the severity. 

 HOW GOOGLE DOES IT: BUILDING AGENTS FOR CYBERSECURITY AND DEFENSE (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When introducing agentic AI to its cybersecurity teams, Google began
by building trust in generative AI by adding chat interfaces to
existing tools. Google security then identified initial use cases for
distillation and translation, focusing on bottlenecks that AI could
alleviate. The team then established and monitored KPIs as they scaled
their program.

 ANNOUNCING GOTATUN, THE FUTURE OF WIREGUARD AT MULLVAD VPN (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Mullvad's GotaTun is a Rust-based WireGuard implementation forked
from Cloudflare's BoringTun that replaces wireguard-go, eliminating
85% of Android app crashes attributed to the Go implementation's FFI
complexity and opaque runtime debugging challenges. The Android
rollout in November reduced the user-perceived crash rate from 0.40%
to 0.01%, with zero GotaTun-originated crashes, while improving
connection speeds and battery efficiency through safe multithreading
and zero-copy memory strategies. Mullvad plans a third-party security
audit in early 2026 before expanding the GotaTun deployment to desktop
and iOS platforms, maintaining full WireGuard protocol compatibility
while supporting privacy features, including DAITA and Multihop.

 DISMANTLING DEFENSES: TRUMP 2.0 CYBER YEAR IN REVIEW (20 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The Trump administration systematically dismantled federal
cybersecurity infrastructure: CISA lost 1/3 of its workforce and faces
$491M budget cuts, the Cyber Safety Review Board was dissolved
mid-investigation of Chinese telecom intrusions, and both NSA and
Cyber Command have operated without leadership since April. DOGE
accessed sensitive federal databases from SSA, DHS, OPM, and Treasury
by circumventing security controls and audit mechanisms, with data
exfiltration coinciding with Russian login attempts using valid DOGE
credentials. Security professionals should prepare for degraded
federal threat intelligence sharing after the elimination of CIPAC and
MS-ISAC funding, reduced public-private coordination as agencies
canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, and increased foreign
intelligence recruitment of laid-off federal employees with security
clearances. 

 DEFENSE BILL ADDRESSES SECURE PHONES, AI TRAINING, CYBER TROOPS'
MENTAL HEALTH (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In addition to $901B in funding, the 2026 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) also includes a series of new cybersecurity
policies. The NDAA includes a provision that secure phones provided to
senior leaders meet a set of security requirements, such as data
encryption. The act also includes increased mental health provisions
and training initiatives around AI security. 

 MINISTERS CONFIRM BREACH AT UK FOREIGN OFFICE BUT DETAILS REMAIN
MURKY (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 UK ministers acknowledge a confirmed cyberattack on the Foreign
Office, first reported by The Sun and widely linked in the media to
Chinese state-backed hackers, though officials stress those claims are
speculative. They say a technical flaw at one site was quickly closed
and insist there is currently low risk to individuals, despite
concerns about possible exposure of visa application data and growing
warnings over China's broader cyber-espionage activity in Europe.
