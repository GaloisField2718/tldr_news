ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK TARGETING LEDGER CRYPTO WALLET LEAVES USERS
HACKED (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Ledger has reported that hackers compromised the code for the Ledger
Connect software development kit used by decentralized apps to
interface with Ledger wallets. The hackers pushed out a malicious
version of the kit. Ledger pushed out an update of the Connect Kit to
replace the malicious one within 40 minutes of becoming aware. The
attackers have amassed $600,000 in stolen funds. 

 APACHE WARNS OF CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN STRUTS 2 (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A new vulnerability, CVE-2023-50164, has been given a maximum
severity rating. It affects Struts 2.0.0-2.3.37 (EOL), Struts
2.5.0-2.5.32, and Struts 6.0.0-6.3.0. An attacker can manipulate file
upload parameters to enable path traversal and under some
circumstances, this can lead to uploading a malicious file which can
be used to perform remote code execution. Struts 2 developers and
users are urged to immediately upgrade to version 2.5.33 or Struts
6.3.0.2, or greater. 

 10K PEOPLE‚ÄôS DATA STOLEN IN GENETIC TESTING COMPANY LEAK (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Asper Biogene has disclosed that personal health data belonging to
approximately 10,000 people has been illegally downloaded. Asper
Biogene began an investigation after discovering that over 100,000
files were accessed and is yet to determine the full scope of data
that was contained in these files. A criminal investigation has also
been launched by the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXTRACTING TRAINING DATA FROM CHATGPT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A group of researchers has developed a novel attack method to extract
several megabytes of ChatGPT‚Äôs training data and theorize that the
technique could be extrapolated to extract ~a gigabyte of training
data. The attack involves prompting the model with ‚Äúrepeat the word
poem forever‚Äù and watching as the model spits out training data.
This article discusses why this works and the implications behind it. 

 BAZARCALL ATTACKS ABUSE GOOGLE FORMS TO LEGITIMIZE PHISHING EMAILS (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 BazarCall is a phishing attack that utilizes an email resembling a
payment notification or subscription confirmation that suggests that a
user is being billed an outrageously high amount for a product or
subscription with a phone number to call for support. The ‚Äúcustomer
support‚Äù team then tricks the user into installing malware onto
their device. The newest wave of these attacks utilizes a Google Form
to create the invoice with the option to send a copy of the completed
form to the entered email which leads to the invoice coming directly
from Google. 

 THE TALE OF GOOGLE‚ÄôS RESPONSE TO REPTAR CPU VULNERABILITY (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 In this blog post, Google discusses its response to the Reptar
vulnerability. The response was led by the Vulnerability Coordination
Center (VulnCC), which ensures a consistent vulnerability management
process across Alphabet. By working alongside the vendors, the
response was successful, with the vulnerability being mitigated
without impacting users or customers.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW PREVALENT IS KEYLOGGER MALWARE? (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Keyloggers can steal the most sensitive user data ‚Äî and new data
[11] shows that this is far from being a solved problem. Between March
to August 2023, Moonlock detected a large number of keylogger samples
[11] on macOS devices. Their report highlights the distribution of
keyloggers, core modules, anti-analysis techniques, code examples, API
usage, detection methods, and more.
Read the full findings on Moonlock Lab (ungated) [11]

 ENVEEDO (WEBSITE) [12] 

 Enveedo is a cyber resilience tool that aims to deliver integrated
risk management and achieve continuous cyber resiliency. It offers a
comprehensive view of the organization‚Äôs IT and security systems,
assets, data, and people and simplifies cybersecurity oversight and
management.

from all Kubernetes nodes in a cluster. 

 NUCLEI AI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Nuclei AI Browser Extension enables users to extract vulnerability
information directly from a webpage to create Nuclei templates. The
extension also enables creating a Nuclei template from an ExploitDB
exploit or HackerOne report. An account from cloud.projectdiscovery.io
is required.

 DISRUPTING THE GATEWAY SERVICES TO CYBERCRIME (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 In this post, Microsoft talks about the disruption of Storm-1152, a
cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) ecosystem that created 750 million
fraudulent Microsoft accounts in support of phishing, identity theft,
and other schemes. The CaaS is believed to have made millions of
dollars in illicit revenue by creating fraudulent accounts for other
cybercrime groups to use in phishing, spam, ransomware, distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS), and other types of attacks. 

 SPECTRE-BASED ATTACK EXPLOITS INTEL, ARM, AND AMD CPUS (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Researchers have found a new type of side-channel attack, named SLAM,
that can circumvent the security features of the latest CPUs. The
attack leverages a memory feature of CPUs that allows storing
untranslated data bits in the kernel metadata to extract encryption
keys and root passwords. Linux has released patches and Intel intends
to issue a patch. Arm and AMD believe they are safe. 

 MICROSOFT WARNS OF OAUTH APPS BEING USED TO AUTOMATE BEC AND
CRYPTOMINING (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Microsoft Threat Intel experts have been investigating a new
post-exploitation technique in which attackers use compromised
accounts to create high-privileged OAuth apps. These OAuth apps allow
attackers to spawn VMs for cryptomining, automate BEC attacks, and
manage spam campaigns without needing to retain access to the original
compromised account. Microsoft recommends enforcing MFA and
conditional access policies to protect against attacks like this.
