TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-03-25

 THE DATA IS IN: 95% OF SECURITY FIXES DON'T REDUCE THE RISK (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 OX Security analyzed 101+ million security findings across 178
organizations [4] and the results are eye-opening : ONLY 2-5% OF THESE
ALERTS ACTUALLY MATTER! The rest? Just static noise, draining your
AppSec and Dev teams while real threats slip by unnoticed. 

The truth is that you don't have a vulnerability problem. You have a
noise problem. 
The fix isn't “more tools and alerts” or “better filters.”
It's a necessary shift from VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT to AUTOMATIC
RISK-DRIVEN REMEDIATION.

Download the full benchmark report [4] with data-backed insights on:

 	* How to prioritize and what to ignore.
 	* How to stop alert fatigue before it breaks your team.
 	* The playbook (With recommendations) of how to secure software
pipelines without slowing down.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AUTHENTICATION BYPASS IN NEXT.JS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Next.js has disclosed a Critical (9.1/10) auth bypass vulnerability.
Next.js uses an internal header, X-middleware-subrequest, to prevent
infinite loops from recursive requests. The vulnerability allowed
users to abuse the header, bypassing middleware checks, including
authorization. 

 CRITICAL INGRESS NGINX CONTROLLER VULNERABILITY ALLOWS RCE WITHOUT
AUTHENTICATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Five vulnerabilities in the NGINX Ingress Admission Controller,
called IngressNightmare, enable remote code execution without
authentication. Attackers can inject harmful configurations to
compromise Kubernetes environments via the admission controller. 

 OVER 3M APPLICANTS' DATA LEAKED ON NYU'S WEBSITE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This past Saturday, a hacker took over NYU's website for at least two
hours and exposed the personal data of over 3M applicants in an act of
hacktivism. The leaked data included names, test scores, majors, zip
codes, financial data, and information on applicants' family members
dating back to at least 1989. The hacker claimed to have breached NYU
to expose its continued use of affirmative action after the 2023
SCOTUS ruling.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BYPASSING DETECTIONS WITH COMMAND-LINE OBFUSCATION (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Defensive tools that use command-line arguments to detect malicious
activity are vulnerable to a technique called ArgFuscator. Obfuscation
can exploit parsing flaws in executables to evade security detections,
highlighting weaknesses in current cybersecurity methods. 

 UNRAVELING TIME: A DEEP DIVE INTO TTD INSTRUCTION EMULATION BUGS (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft's Time Travel Debugging (TTD) framework is a powerful
record-and-replay tool that uses CPU instruction emulation to replay
program execution. Google's Mandiant team found a bug in the emulation
engine and built a fuzzing harness to execute random instruction
sequences through TTD and a real CPU, discovering three bugs in the
process, which they reported to Microsoft. 

 TUTORIAL: UNPACKING EXECUTABLES WITH TINYTRACER + PE-SIEVE (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This tutorial demonstrates how to unpack a modified UPX-packed
executable using TinyTracer and PE-sieve tools, which avoids
anti-debugging measures common in packed malware. The process involves
first tracing the executable to identify its Original Entry Point
(OEP), setting a stop offset in TinyTracer to pause execution at the
OEP, then using HollowsHunter to dump and reconstruct the unpacked
program with its Import Address Table. After dumping, final
modifications are needed in PE-bear to fix the entry point and restore
proper section characteristics for the executable to run successfully.

 ALBABAT RANSOMWARE EXPANDS TARGETS, ABUSES GITHUB (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Albabat ransomware is evolving to target Windows, Linux, and macOS
platforms. Retrieving components from a GitHub repository, it now
harvests system information, encrypts files across multiple operating
systems, and tracks infections in a PostgreSQL database. 

 DRYRUN SECURITY VS TRADITIONAL SAST VENDORS IN RUBY ON RAILS (10
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post compares DryRun Security's contextual scanner to Snyk Code,
GitHub Advanced Security, Semgrep, and SonarQube in finding
vulnerabilities in the intentionally vulnerable RailsGoat. The test PR
included SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, IDOR, user enumeration, and
hardcoded token vulnerabilities. DryRun was the only tool that found
all the vulnerabilities, whereas Semgrep found 3/6, GitHub and Snyk
found 2/6, and SonarQube found none. 

 AWS WAF NOW SUPPORTS URI FRAGMENT FIELD MATCHING (2 MINUTE READ) [17]


 AWS WAF has added support for using URI Fragments in match statements
along with the URI path. A URI Fragment is often the part of a URL
that comes after a # character to identify specific sections or
anchors.
