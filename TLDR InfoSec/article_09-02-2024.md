ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SECURITY FLAW IN A POPULAR SMART HELMET ALLOWED SILENT LOCATION
TRACKING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Livall fixed a flaw allowing real-time location tracking of its
connected helmets. The skiing and biking helmets featured group chats
and location sharing via apps. Accessing a group only required an
easy-to-guess numeric ID. Anyone was able to listen in and track
locations. 

 CHINESE HACKING CAMPAIGN AIMED AT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE GOES BACK
FIVE YEARS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A CISA reveals that the Chinese threat actor Volt Typhoon has
maintained footholds in critical infrastructure for at least five
years. The report doesn‚Äôt mention any specific companies but
mentions the rail, aviation, mass transit, highway, maritime,
pipeline, water, and sewage industries. 

 CRITICAL BOOT LOADER VULNERABILITY IN SHIM IMPACTS NEARLY ALL LINUX
DISTROS (3 MINUTES READ) [7] 

 The maintainers of Shim have released a new version to fix 6 security
vulnerabilities, including one critical flaw that could allow for
remote code execution. Shim is used as a first-stage bootloader in
many Linux distros for UEFI systems. The vulnerability stems from
Shim‚Äôs HTTP boot support trusting attacker-controlled values when
parsing an HTTP response.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YARA THREAT DETECTION LAB (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article covers how to identify file IoCs and create YARA rules
to detect malicious activity using tools like yarGen and Arya for
generation and testing. Developing YARA skills is critical for
security roles to detect and mitigate threats. YARA allows creating
customized rules matching an organization's needs to classify malware
based on signatures. 

 KMS KEY POLICY PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post presents an attack chain that could allow an AWS
Administrator to override a KMS key policy that was restricted to only
a specific identity. In this attack scenario, one admin can lock down
a KMS key to their specific use, but another admin can bypass these
restrictions by deleting the first admin‚Äôs IAM user, changing the
contact on the AWS account, and then opening a ticket with AWS support
to recover the key. As no identity will be able to access the key, AWS
support will then contact the new phone number to verify the request
and facilitate the reset. The post ends with some potential
mitigations. 

 SHELLCODE EVASION USING WEBASSEMBLY AND RUST (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Meterpreter and its helper PEs are easily detected by antivirus
programs due to their age and widespread use. This can be overcome by
leveraging WebAssembly, a low-level assembly-like language that can be
run in web browsers and written in multiple backend languages. This
article provides code examples in Rust and explains how to compile
Rust to Wasm.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CYBERCRIME DUO ACCUSED OF PICKING $2.5M FROM APPLE'S ORCHARD (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple was likely defrauded of a total of $2.6M in gift cards/hardware
by hackers Noah Roskin-Frazee and Keith Latteri via an Apple
contractor. Though unnamed in the case, the victim matches Apple's
description and location. The duo allegedly stole and resold items,
cashing in on the theft from Apple and its customer support
contractor. 

 US AGENCY DECLARES AI CLONED VOICE ROBOCALLS ILLEGAL (3 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The FCC has officially banned robocalls using AI-generated voices,
deeming them "artificial" and illegal under existing laws like the
Telephone Consumer Protection Act. While fake AI celebrity calls will
likely still plague phones, this makes it clear that such scams
violate robocall prohibitions. 

 SURGE IN DEEPFAKE ‚ÄúFACE SWAP‚Äù ATTACKS PUTS REMOTE IDENTITY
VERIFICATION AT RISK (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A new report by biometric firm iProov shows that deepfake "face swap"
attacks have increased by 704% from the first to the second half of
2023. Fraudsters are using off-the-shelf tools to create manipulated
images and videos, making it easier to create convincing deepfakes.
These deepfakes can trick remote identity verification systems into
believing that the subject's "liveness" is real.
