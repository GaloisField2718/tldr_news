 AMA: INSIDE THE OWASP TOP 10 FOR AGENTIC APPLICATIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The industry now has a peer-reviewed risk framework for autonomous,
tool-using AI agents. In this live AMA-style webinar [4] on Wed. 1/28,
engage with CHRIS HUGHES, STEVE WILSON, MICHAEL BARGURY, AND KAYLA
UNDERKOFFLER - security experts who helped shape the new OWASP
standard.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CLAUDE COWORK EXFILTRATES FILES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Claude Cowork is a new general-purpose agent now available in
research preview. It is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection via
uploaded files and can be abused to exfiltrate sensitive documents.
This attack exploits a previously reported, unremediated vulnerability
in the Claude sandbox that allows network connections to the Claude
API. 

 GRUBHUB CONFIRMS HACKERS STOLE DATA IN RECENT BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Grubhub has confirmed that an unarmed threat actor accessed its
systems and stole data. While Grubhub has not confirmed the identity
of the threat actor, sources have reported that the ShinyHunters group
is extorting the company. The threat actor is reportedly extorting the
company to prevent the leak of data from an older Salesforce instance
and to prevent the theft of data from the company's current Zendesk
platform. 

 HOW A HACKING CAMPAIGN TARGETED HIGH-PROFILE GMAIL AND WHATSAPP USERS
ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A phishing campaign delivered via WhatsApp targeted Iranian
activists, academics, government officials, and business leaders
across the Middle East, stealing Gmail credentials with 2FA codes,
hijacking WhatsApp accounts via malicious QR codes, and attempting to
exfiltrate location data, photos, and audio recordings. An exposed
attacker server revealed 850+ records affecting fewer than 50
confirmed victims, with infrastructure registered as early as August
2025 using DuckDNS for domain masking. Security researchers noted
hallmarks consistent with IRGC-linked spearphishing, though financial
motivations have not been ruled out. Users should avoid clicking
unsolicited WhatsApp links and regularly audit linked devices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PREPARED STATEMENTS? PREPARED TO BE VULNERABLE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Prepared statements are a standard recommendation to solve most SQL
injection issues. This post demonstrates a technique discovered while
working on a pentest for manipulating prepared statements in
JavaScript applications using the mysql or mysql2 package. The
packages convert arrays and JSON objects to SQL fragments by default,
which could allow an attacker to perform SQL injection. 

 THOUGHTS ON PROMPT INJECTION OPSEC (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Prompt injection prompts are akin to 0days and should not be
published. Prompt injection prompts that are not customer-specific
should be shared because attackers already have access to prompt
injection strings, so the benefit to defenders of seeing real-world
threats outweighs the risks. 

 HOW THREAT ACTORS ARE USING SELF-HOSTED GITHUB ACTIONS RUNNERS AS
BACKDOORS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Shai-Hulud worm demonstrated how attackers weaponize self-hosted
GitHub Actions runners as persistent backdoors by installing rogue
runners on compromised machines and using GitHub Discussions as a
command-and-control channel via intentionally vulnerable workflows
with command injection. The technique exploited the
RUNNER_TRACKING_ID=0 environment variable to bypass process cleanup
and achieve persistence, while all traffic flowed to github.com,
evading traditional network defenses. Security teams should audit
runner inventories for unauthorized registrations, implement ephemeral
runners, restrict self-hosted runners to private repositories only,
and deploy runtime detection for persistence techniques.

 MCP BREACH-TO-FIX LABS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 This repository contains a collection of 10 MCP challenges reproduced
from real CVEs and public incident reports. 

 SIGDREAM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 sigdream provides a sigreturn-oriented programming-based sleep
obfuscation library that encrypts PT_LOAD segments and the heap. 

 TANGLED (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Tangled is a phishing platform that weaponizes iCalendar rendering
features in Microsoft Outlook and Gmail to automatically add spoofed
meeting invites to targets' calendars without user interaction. The
tool automates the delivery of social engineering campaigns and runs
as Docker containers, with a web-based dashboard for managing phishing
operations. Red teams can use this to test an organization's
susceptibility to calendar-based phishing attacks that bypass
traditional email security controls.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NPM TO IMPLEMENT STAGED PUBLISHING AFTER TURBULENT SHIFT OFF CLASSIC
TOKENS (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 npm has announced a new release strategy called staged publishing to
protect against future compromises in the wake of 2025's Shai-Hulud
supply chain compromises. Staged publishing will complement npm's
previous credentials safety efforts by requiring new project releases
to be manually approved via an MFA-verified maintainer. Package
maintainers have expressed a need for more registry-level protections
after npm's chaotic removal of classic tokens. 

 CRITICAL FLAW IN AWS CONSOLE RISKED COMPROMISE OF BUILD ENVIRONMENT
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers from Wiz discovered a vulnerability in the way CodeBuild
CI pipelines handled build triggers. This vulnerability could have
been exploited to take over AWS repositories, including the AWS
JavaScript SDK, which powers the AWS console. AWS immediately took
steps to remediate the vulnerability before any exploitation occurred.


 ACCOUNT TAKEOVER IN FACEBOOK MOBILE APP DUE TO USAGE OF
CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY UNSECURE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR AND XSS IN FACEBOOK
JS SDK (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A security researcher chained multiple vulnerabilities in Facebook's
JavaScript SDK to achieve account takeover in the Facebook mobile app,
exploiting Math.random() for callback identifier generation, DOM XSS
via unsanitized SVG injection in the Customer Chat plugin, and
X-Frame-Options bypass in mobile webviews. The attack reconstructed
the PRNG state by forcing plugin iframe reinitializations and
observing leaked window.name values, enabling prediction of
security-critical callback identifiers. Meta awarded a $66,000 bounty
and fixed the vulnerability in December 2023.
