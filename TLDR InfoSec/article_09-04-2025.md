ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 UMMC FACING CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR ENABLING CYBERSTALKING CAMPAIGN
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) is being sued by
current and former employees for enabling a pharmacist to conduct
cyberstalking due to a lack of security practices. The pharmacist used
a keylogger and installed spyware on at least 400 computers in UMMC to
obtain employees' usernames and passwords to access the accounts of
about 80 female co-workers for nearly a decade. The hacker hacked
victims' cloud accounts to steal private information and used
internet-connected cameras to watch the victims in their homes. 

 FLAW IN ESET SECURITY SOFTWARE USED TO SPREAD MALWARE FROM TODDYCAT
GROUP (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A threat actor known as ToddyCat has exploited a vulnerability in
ESET's antivirus scanner. The vulnerability could allow privileged
attackers to plant a malicious DLL and execute it through the
antivirus scanner. The attackers in this campaign are using a tool
dubbed TCDSB, which seems to be an extension of EDRSandBlast, to alter
key components of the OS and disable alerts. 

 OCC EMAIL SYSTEM BREACH DESCRIBED AS ‘STUNNING, SERIOUS' (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 On February 11, the OCC, the US's banking regulator, discovered
unusual activity between a system admin account and user mailboxes.
Unknown attackers had accessed over 150,000 emails since June 2023.
Security analyst David Shipley called the intrusion "massively
serious," posing a potential threat to national banking
infrastructure. The OCC, which regulates all national banks, has hired
third-party cybersecurity experts for a full investigation while
asserting that its security controls meet or exceed NIST standards.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLOUD INCIDENT READINESS: KEY LOGS FOR CLOUD INCIDENTS (6 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 This post ranks key logs for cloud incident readiness as must-have,
should-have, and nice-to-have for Microsoft, AWS, and Google. It uses
real-life incident response cases to highlight the importance of
enabling and retaining the right logs for security monitoring and
analysis. 

 COMBINING DLL SIDELOADING AND SYSCALLS FOR EVASION (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This article examines DLL Sideloading and using Direct Syscalls as
evasion techniques to bypass Antivirus and EDR solutions by loading
malicious DLLs via legitimate applications. Using hijacking and Direct
Syscalls, the author shows how to create and execute a malicious DLL
that evades static detection and executes shellcode on a victim
machine. Elastic YARA rules and Havoc C2 are used for generating and
testing shellcode, enhancing evasion against security defenses. 

 GAMAREDON CAMPAIGN ABUSES LNK FILES TO DISTRIBUTE REMCOS BACKDOOR (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cisco Talos is tracking an ongoing campaign targeting users in
Ukraine with malicious LNK files that resemble war-related files to
eventually download the Remcos backdoor. The LNK files run a
PowerShell command to launch a decoy file and download the
second-stage zip file containing the backdoor. The second stage
payload then uses DLL side-loading to execute the Remcos payload.
Cisco believes that this campaign is associated with Gamaredon.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE (PROVEN) IMPACT OF PASSWORD MANAGEMENT ON ENTERPRISE SECURITY
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 In a recent survey of enterprise end users by Bitwarden, 96% of
organizations say Bitwarden has improved their security posture and
81% have reduced reused passwords. That's just another reason why
Bitwarden Password Manager [11] is trusted by millions to store,
share, and protect login credentials and sensitive enterprise data.
Get the report [10]. 

 ATTEST-BUILD-PROVENANCE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The attest-build-provenance action generates signed build provenance
attestations for workflow artifacts. These attestations associate an
artifact with its digest to SLSA build provenance predicate in the
in-toto format, accompanied by a verifiable signature from a
short-lived Sigstore certificate. The attestation generation differs
based on repository visibility: public repositories use the public
Sigstore instance, while private repositories utilize GitHub's private
Sigstore. 

 GHIDRAMCP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ghidraMCP is a Model Context Protocol server that allows LLMs to
autonomously reverse engineer applications. It exposes numerous tools
from core Ghidra functionality to MCP clients. 

 LNAV - THE LOGFILE NAVIGATOR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 lnav is a terminal log file viewer that supports decompressing files,
detecting file format, merging files based on timestamp, tailing
files, and building an index of errors and warnings.

 FIVE VPN APPS IN THE GOOGLE PLAY AND APP STORE HAD LINKS TO CHINESE
MILITARY (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A joint investigation by the Tech Transparency Project and the
Financial Times found that at least five VPN apps present in both the
App Store and Google Play store had links to a company associated with
the Chinese military. Three of the apps have racked up more than a
million downloads. The five apps cited were Turbo VPN, VPN Proxy
Master, Thunder VPN, Snap VPN, and Signal Secure VPN (unaffiliated
with the messaging app). 

 ENHANCING CLOUD SECURITY IN AI/ML: THE LITTLE PICKLE STORY (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Python pickles are a serialization format that is commonly used in
AI/ML workflows in Python. Pickles that come from unsafe sources can
result in arbitrary code execution due to invalidated object loading,
corrupt models, exposure of sensitive data, or lead to sensitive
information disclosure due to a lack of encryption. One strategy for
scanning pickle files using static code analysis is to generate a list
of all Python libraries that are used in your environment, validate
any pre-built rules in existing static code analysis tooling, and
write custom rules in tools like Semgrep to identify pickling and
unpickling methods. 

 WHATSAPP FOR WINDOWS FLAW COULD LET HACKERS SNEAK IN MALICIOUS FILES
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A security flaw (CVE-2025-30401) in WhatsApp for Windows allowed
hackers to send malicious files to users, posing a risk to those
interacting with attachments. The vulnerability could trick users into
opening harmful code disguised as harmless files. To stay safe, users
should update WhatsApp to version 2.2450.6 or later and be cautious
when opening file attachments.
