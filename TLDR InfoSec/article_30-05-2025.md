ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DATA BREACH AFFECTS 38K UCHICAGO MEDICINE PATIENTS (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 UChicago Medicine released a statement that the data of 38K patients
may have been exposed in a July 2024 breach. The data breach was
caused by a third-party debt collector's system breach. The exposed
data may include SSNs, addresses, dates of birth, medical information,
and financial account information. 

 THREAT ACTORS ABUSE GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT IN EVASIVE PHISHING ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threat actors are exploiting Google Apps Script to create phishing
pages that mimic legitimate sites, enhancing their credibility. This
tactic reduces the likelihood of detection by security tools. As a
result, users may be more easily deceived into providing sensitive
information. 

 FAKE CHATGPT AND INVIDEO AI DOWNLOADS DELIVER RANSOMWARE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Cisco Talos has discovered three malware families—CyberLock
ransomware, Lucky_Gh0$t ransomware, and Numero malware—that disguise
themselves as legitimate AI tool installers for ChatGPT, InVideo AI,
and NovaLeadsAI. These threats spread through SEO poisoning, social
media, and messaging platforms, specifically targeting sales,
technology, and marketing businesses. CyberLock demands $50,000 in
Monero cryptocurrency, Lucky_Gh0$t encrypts files under 1.2GB while
destroying larger ones, and Numero renders Windows systems unusable by
interfering with the graphical interface.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DETECTION-IN-DEPTH (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Detection-in-depth is a detection engineering concept modeled after
the principle of defense-in-depth, in which security teams create
detections to catch an attacker at every step of the attack chain.
Detections (including out-of-the-box detections that come with a
platform) must be fine-tuned to the specific environment to reduce
false positives. They should be tested using threat emulation tools
such as Atomic Red Team and penetration testing activities. 

 HTML TO PDF RENDERER: A TALE OF LOCAL FILE ACCESS AND SHELLCODE
EXECUTION (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In a recent engagement, a penetration tester from Neodyme tested a
tool that converted HTML to PDF. The tester's first instinct was to
attempt Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), which they succeeded in
doing in a test environment. They then discovered that they could
enumerate information about the engine and local files. The tester
then found an exploit against the outdated Chromium browser used by
the converter to render the HTML and adapted it to obtain shellcode
execution on the server. 

 DECODING TCP SYN FOR STRONGER NETWORK SECURITY (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 NETSCOUT analyzed TCP SYN segments from honeypots to identify network
security patterns, examining source addresses, IPv4 TTL values, and
TCP header lengths. The study found no source address spoofing despite
expectations, discovered that TTL values varied widely from the same
sources due to path diversity, and identified that many anomalies
correlated with crafted packets from suspicious networks. The research
demonstrates that analyzing TCP header patterns can effectively
distinguish legitimate traffic from potential threats, with 20-byte
headers and zero sequence numbers as strong indicators of malicious
activity.

 FROM REVERSE ENGINEERING TO CHEAT DEVELOPMENT: INTERNAL GAME HACKS
WITH ASSAULTCUBE (13 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This guide shows how to build an internal cheat for the AssaultCube
game by injecting a custom DLL into the game's memory. It explains how
to hook into game functions like damage and add advanced features such
as aimbot and wallhacks. The project is intended to be a technical
learning tool for understanding game memory and function hooking. 

 US SANCTIONS FIRM LINKED TO CYBER SCAMS BEHIND $200 MILLION IN LOSSES
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Funnull Technology, a
Philippines-based company facilitating numerous malicious websites.
These sites are connected to cyber scams that have resulted in over
$200 million in losses for Americans. The sanctions aim to disrupt the
operations of this company and its role in cybercrime. 

 MARK YOUR CALENDAR: APT41 INNOVATIVE TACTICS (12 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google's Threat Intelligence Group discovered APT41 using the
"TOUGHPROGRESS" malware, which exploits Google Calendar for command
and control communications. The malware is delivered through
spear-phishing emails containing ZIP archives hosted on compromised
government websites. To evade detection, the malware uses a
three-stage infection chain (PLUSDROP, PLUSINJECT, and TOUGHPROGRESS)
with advanced obfuscation techniques, including 64-bit register
overflow and control flow obfuscation. Google disrupted the campaign
by developing custom detection signatures, terminating
attacker-controlled Calendar accounts and Workspace projects, and
adding malicious domains to Safe Browsing blocklists.
