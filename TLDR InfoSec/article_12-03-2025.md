 OSINT FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION: THE COMPLETE GUIDE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Executives are prime targets for cyber and physical attacks—are you
equipped to protect them?

Doxxing. Deepfakes. Targeted harassment. Threats against high-profile
individuals often start online—and if they go unnoticed, they can
escalate into serious security risks. In THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO OSINT
FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION [4], Flashpoint breaks down how security
teams can:

 	* Identify and neutralize digital threats before they escalate
 	* Set up real-time alerts and remove sensitive data
 	* Use AI-powered analysis, social intelligence, and geospatial data
to track bad actors

 EVALUATING AWS NATIVE APPROACHES FOR DETECTING SUSPICIOUS API CALLS
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A comparison of three methods for detecting suspicious AWS API calls.
Eventbridge offers quick response times and low cost but lacks support
for multi-account or complex setups. CloudTrail to Lambda provides
flexibility and visibility with easy multi-account integrations but is
slower. The CloudWatch with Metric Filters approach is faster than
Lambda, but increases complexity in AWS pattern syntax. 

 A DEEP DIVE INTO JS TRUSTED TYPES VIOLATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Trusted Types implementation in Gmail and AppSheet eliminated DOM XSS
vulnerabilities using developer-focused approaches to find and fix
violations. Key strategies included deploying static analysis tools
for early detection and utilizing runtime analysis techniques to track
violations through script-sample searches and minified code
examination. The work created patterns and tools like Trusted Types
Helper to fix violations, contributing to better security practices
across the JavaScript ecosystem.
