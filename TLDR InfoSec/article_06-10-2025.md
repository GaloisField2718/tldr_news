 WHY YOU SHOULD USE PRIMARY SOURCES FOR YOUR THREAT INTELLIGENCE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your threat intelligence is only as good as the data that feeds into
it - and no amount of AI will change that. If you're relying on the
same static data feeds as everyone else, you're likely to fall into
the same traps.

Primary Source Collection (PSC) [4] lets you deliver actionable
intelligence for cyber threat investigations, fraud prevention,
executive protection, and more. It allows you to capture threats
directly from the source [4] - including closed, invite-only, and
fringe communities that are inaccessible to most vendors.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DISCORD DISCLOSES DATA BREACH AFTER HACKERS STEAL SUPPORT TICKETS (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Discord suffered a data breach on September 20. The Scattered Lapsus$
Hunters threat group compromised a third-party Zendesk customer
service system, stealing personal data, including names, government
IDs, partial payment information, and support communications from
users who contacted Discord's support teams. The attackers demanded a
ransom payment and threatened to leak the stolen data, which security
experts warn could be valuable for solving cryptocurrency-related
crimes, as many scammers use Discord without proper anonymization.
Organizations should review their third-party vendor access controls,
implement additional monitoring for customer service platforms, and
ensure incident response procedures include immediate isolation of
compromised third-party systems. 

 HACKING GROUP CLAIMS THEFT OF 1 BILLION RECORDS FROM SALESFORCE
CUSTOMER DATABASES (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacking group known by several names, including Scattered Spider
and ShinyHunters, claims to have stolen approximately a billion
records from companies using Salesforce cloud databases. The group is
extorting victims with threats to leak stolen data unless ransoms are
paid. Multiple major companies are affected. Salesforce denies any
breach of its platform or vulnerabilities in its systems. 

 RESEARCHERS WARN OF SELF-SPREADING WHATSAPP MALWARE NAMED SORVEPOTEL
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SORVEPOTEL is a self-propagating malware campaign targeting Brazilian
users that spreads through WhatsApp by exploiting social trust and
sending malicious ZIP file attachments disguised as receipts or health
app files. The attack chain begins with phishing messages from
compromised contacts, which leads victims to open Windows shortcut
files that execute PowerShell scripts to download payloads from
external servers and establish persistence via the Windows Startup
folder. Once installed, the malware automatically detects active
WhatsApp Web sessions and mass-distributes the malicious ZIP files to
all contacts and groups, prioritizing rapid propagation over data
theft and frequently resulting in account bans due to spam violations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 POINTER LEAKS THROUGH POINTER-KEYED DATA STRUCTURES (13 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Google Project Zero demonstrated a novel technique to remotely leak
memory addresses without memory safety violations by exploiting
pointer-keyed data structures in Apple's NSKeyedArchiver
serialization. The attack works by crafting specific NSDictionary
objects with carefully chosen NSNumber keys to control hash bucket
placement, then using the serialized ordering of an NSNull singleton
(whose hash is its memory address) to determine its location in the
shared cache. While theoretical and requiring a
deserialize-reserialize attack surface, this technique demonstrates
how pointer-based hashing in keyed data structures can leak addresses
even without timing attacks. Organizations should audit serialization
endpoints and consider using keyed hash functions instead of raw
pointer addresses for object hashing. 

 SIGNAL PROTOCOL AND POST-QUANTUM RATCHETS (23 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Signal's Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet (SPQR) is part of a new "Triple
Ratchet" protocol that combines its existing Double Ratchet with
quantum-resistant ML-KEM cryptography to protect against future
quantum computing threats while maintaining forward secrecy and
post-compromise security. The implementation uses erasure coding and
state machines to efficiently transmit large ML-KEM keys (over 1,000
bytes) in small chunks, includes a graceful downgrade mechanism for
backward compatibility during rollout, and employs formal verification
using ProVerif and F* to ensure protocol correctness. Security
professionals should note that this represents a practical approach to
post-quantum migration, which preserves existing security guarantees
while introducing quantum resistance. The protocol automatically
upgrades conversations without requiring user intervention. 

 VED 2026: AFTER CFI - DATA ONLY (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Modern kernel privilege escalation attacks have shifted from
traditional control flow methods like ROP to more stealthy, stable
data-only attacks that bypass Control Flow Integrity (CFI), prompting
the development of advanced defense systems like VED (Vault Exploit
Defense). Novel techniques, such as DirtyPipe, cred-jar heap spray,
and pipe primitives, exploit weaknesses in kernel memory handling to
corrupt authentication data or page buffers, directly overwriting
critical structures, including credential jars and pipe buffers, while
evading detection by typical CFI solutions. VED counters these threats
through multiple integrity measures, including shadow data tracking,
hash monitoring, slab poisoning, and specialized protections for core
patterns and pipe buffers, aiming to detect stealthy modifications and
strengthen kernel security against increasingly sophisticated
data-centric exploits while minimizing performance impact.
