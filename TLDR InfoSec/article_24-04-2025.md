ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TEXAS CITY TAKES SYSTEMS OFFLINE AFTER CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Abilene, Texas, suffered a cyberattack that caused server outages.
Officials disconnected affected systems and hired cybersecurity
experts. Emergency services remain operational, while card payment
systems at government offices are currently unavailable. A complete
recovery is expected to take several weeks. 

 SK TELECOM REVEALS CYBERATTACK, CUSTOMER USIM DATA STOLEN COULD BE
USED IN ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 SK Telecom detected a malware attack targeting customer USIM data in
mid-April. The company quickly isolated affected systems, notified
authorities, and implemented security measures to prevent USIM swaps
and suspicious authentication attempts. No data has appeared on the
dark web, and no group has claimed responsibility for the incident. 

 GOOGLE FIXES CLOUD COMPOSER PRIVILEGE ESCALATION VULNERABILITY (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability impacting the
Cloud Composer 2 managed workflow orchestration service. Cloud
Composer allows any user with edit permissions to install a package
from PyPi, which is then installed by Cloud Build. Prior to this fix,
Cloud Build used the highly privileged default Cloud Build service
account. An attacker could install a malicious PyPi package that
exfiltrates the sensitive Cloud Build credentials.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I MADE $64K FROM DELETED FILES — A BUG BOUNTY STORY (14 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Security researcher Sharon Brizinov earned $64,000 by discovering
secrets in deleted GitHub repository files. His research highlighted
how Git retains copies of all files in its commit history, even after
they are deleted from the working directory. Completely removing
sensitive files requires specific tools, such as git filter-branch or
git-filter-repo, as Git maintains references in its object storage for
several weeks before performing garbage collection. 

 MCP: BUILDING YOUR SECOPS AI ECOSYSTEM (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MCPs offer a standardized way for LLMs to interact with various
tools, which can significantly aid SecOps teams in leveraging
disparate security tools for investigations. AI Agents can currently
perform specialized automations to complete tasks that require minimal
human intervention, whereas MCPs can facilitate flexible workflows
guided by humans. In the future, we may see vendors create more MCPs
for their tooling, as well as a convergence between agents and MCPs. 

 GAINING LONG-TERM AWS ACCESS WITH CODEBUILD AND GITHUB (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Attackers can exploit AWS CodeBuild and GitHub for persistent access
after compromising an AWS account. They can modify an IAM role's trust
policy to allow CodeBuild to assume it, link CodeBuild to an
attacker-controlled GitHub repository, and create GitHub Actions
workflows that execute commands using the permissions of the assumed
role. This technique is more discreet than creating new IAM users with
admin privileges, as the activity appears as legitimate CodeBuild
operations from AWS infrastructure IPs, not external ones.

 GOOGLE WON'T DITCH THIRD-PARTY COOKIES IN CHROME AFTER ALL (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Google has abandoned plans to replace third-party cookies with its
Privacy Sandbox initiative after years of development struggles.
Initially proposed in 2019, the company's alternatives, like FLoC and
Topics API, faced criticism and delays. Google will now maintain
cookie support indefinitely while continuing to develop privacy
features for Incognito. 

 DPRK HACKERS STEAL $137M FROM TRON USERS IN SINGLE-DAY PHISHING
ATTACK (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 North Korean hackers are targeting cryptocurrency organizations to
generate funds amid international sanctions. Google's Mandiant
identified multiple threat groups using custom malware tools across
Windows, Linux, and macOS to infiltrate Web3 companies and steal large
amounts of TRON. 

 OUTSIDE EXPERTS PICK UP THE SLACK ON TESTING OPENAI'S NEWEST MODEL
RELEASE (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AI red teaming company SplxAI chose to publish its own testing after
OpenAI failed to publish a safety report for GPT-4.1 as it did for
4.0. SplxAI used the same prompts from its 4.0 testing to simulate a
financial advisor and evaluate its safety in 11 categories across
1,000 simulated tests. GPT-4.1 performed 3x worse than GPT-4.0.
Following OpenAI's guidance that 4.1 may require more explicit
prompting, the SplxAI team developed a 1,400-word prompt over 5 hours
of iterating that performed better than their initial prompt.
