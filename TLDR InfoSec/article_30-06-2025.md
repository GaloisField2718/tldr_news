ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACKERS STOLE DATA ON 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE IN CYBERATTACK AFFECTING
AMERICAN GROCERY CHAINS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Dutch conglomerate Ahold Delhaize disclosed that over 2.2 million
people had personal data stolen in a November cyberattack. The breach
exposed Social Security numbers, financial information, and health
data. The INC ransomware gang has claimed responsibility, allegedly
stealing six terabytes of data. 

 ALOHA, YOU'VE BEEN PWNED: HAWAIIAN AIRLINES DISCLOSES
‘CYBERSECURITY EVENT' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hawaiian Airlines disclosed a cybersecurity incident on June 23
affecting IT systems, though flights continue operating normally.
Security experts suspect the Scattered Spider gang, known for
targeting retail and insurance sectors, was involved. The airline
immediately engaged authorities and cybersecurity experts. 

 BLUETOOTH FLAWS COULD LET HACKERS SPY THROUGH YOUR MICROPHONE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Three vulnerabilities in Airoha Bluetooth chipsets affect 29 audio
devices from major brands like Bose, Sony, and JBL, allowing attackers
within Bluetooth range to eavesdrop on conversations and hijack phone
connections. The flaws enable the extraction of call history and
contacts and the ability to initiate calls to arbitrary numbers by
exploiting missing authentication in Bluetooth protocols. While
technically serious, practical attacks require physical proximity and
high technical skills, limiting the threat to high-value targets in
sensitive industries.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DISSECTING RDP ACTIVITY (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post examines RDP activity using Windows event logs for
cybersecurity forensics. It identifies important event IDs for
successful logins (1149 and 4624), failed attempts (4625), and session
changes to detect brute-force attacks. The author demonstrates how
correlating these events helps create timelines to reconstruct
attacker behavior. 

 LEVERAGING GOOGLE ADK FOR CYBER INTELLIGENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog explains how to set up a multi-agent system for threat
intelligence gathering and analysis. It uses Kafka, DSPy, and Neo4j to
coordinate specialized agents that discover, collect, and process
security feeds. The system extracts IOCs, maps threats to MITRE
ATT&CK, and builds comprehensive threat intelligence graphs with
natural language querying capabilities. 

 WHAT SHOULD I WORK ON NEXT? A FRAMEWORK FOR HIGH-IMPACT SECURITY WORK
(6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 To drive maximal efficiency on teams, security managers should
optimize the work they assign based on business goals, implicit
interest, and personal growth. Security managers should seek out
projects that allow them to establish a strong connection between
business goals and the engineering roadmap. Given multiple projects
with similar levels of business impact, managers should then consider
assigning work that fits best with engineers' interests and personal
growth objectives.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REVENG AI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 RevEng AI enables security engineers and malware analysts to identify
malicious components and verify the integrity of software supply
chains without requiring access to source code. 

 SBT-SBOM (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The sbt-sbom plugin creates CycloneDX-compatible Software Bill of
Materials (SBOM) files from sbt projects for security tools. You can
customize the BOM and choose dependencies. It supports both XML and
JSON formats. 

 CLOUDFLARE OPEN-SOURCES ORANGE MEETS WITH END-TO-END ENCRYPTION (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Cloudflare has added end-to-end encryption to its open-source video
app, Orange Meets, making video calls more secure. The app utilizes a
robust group encryption protocol and allows users to verify their
safety number to prevent potential attacks. Orange Meets is a demo for
developers and privacy fans, not a full-featured video chat tool like
Zoom or Google Meet.

 IDENTITY THEFT HITS 1.1M REPORTS — AND AUTHENTICATION FATIGUE IS
ONLY GETTING WORSE (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article discusses the balance between security and user
convenience in authentication. With fraud increasing, businesses must
offer multiple authentication options (passwords, passkeys, 2FA, and
MFA) since customer preferences vary. Future authentication will use
continuous risk-based signals rather than one-time logins, while AI
complicates bot detection. 

 TRY THIS ONE WEIRD TRICK RUSSIAN HACKERS HATE (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Installing a Russian or Ukrainian virtual keyboard can block many
ransomware strains that check the system language to avoid infecting
their home countries. Microsoft's June 2021 patches fix six actively
exploited zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers use for privilege
escalation and ransomware deployment. Security researchers have
identified connections between the DarkSide and REvil ransomware
groups, with both sharing exclusion lists and operational patterns. 

 SCHREMS' PRIVACY NGO FILES COMPLAINT AGAINST DATING APP BUMBLE'S AI
FEATURE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Privacy group Noyb has filed a complaint with the Austrian
authorities against the dating app Bumble's use of generative AI in
its “AI Icebreaker” feature. Noyb is concerned about how data is
being sent to OpenAI's servers while only displaying a pop-up, which
Noyb considers “fake” consent. Bumble has responded that it takes
precautions with its users' data and does not send any special
category data.
