ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 POLAND'S ENERGY GRID WAS TARGETED BY NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN WIPER MALWARE
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Poland's power grid faced a cyberattack in December that involved a
new “DynoWiper” malware. Likely linked to Russia's Sandworm group,
the attempt to disrupt electricity failed. The operation coincided
with the 10th anniversary of Sandworm's landmark 2015 Ukraine
blackout, and it fits a long pattern of Russian wiper use. 

 FORTINET ADMITS FORTIGATE SSO BUG STILL EXPLOITABLE DESPITE DECEMBER
PATCH (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Attackers can still exploit a critical FortiCloud SSO authentication
vulnerability in FortiOS, even on systems fully patched in December,
by abusing a new SAML-based SSO attack path. Recent campaigns involve
automated reconfiguration of FortiGate firewalls, the creation of
backdoor admin accounts, and the theft of configuration files.
Fortinet has urged customers to monitor authentication logs, restrict
management exposure, and track admin changes while it develops a new
fix. 

 ANCIENT TELNET BUG HAPPILY HANDS OUT ROOT TO ATTACKERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A critical (CVSS 9.8) vulnerability in telnet could allow
unauthenticated users to obtain root privileges on systems running
InetUtils telnetd. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker only
needs to set their USER environment variable to “-f root” and pass
the “-a” or “--login” flag to telnet. Experts recommend
updating to the latest version of telnet or, ideally, switching to a
more secure protocol such as SSH.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KUBERNETES V1.35: A BETTER WAY TO PASS SERVICE ACCOUNT TOKENS TO CSI
DRIVERS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Kubernetes v1.35 added the ability for CSI drivers to opt-in to
receiving service account tokens via the `secret` field in
`NodePublishVolumeRequest`. Prior to this update, service account
tokens were received via the `volume_context` field, which could lead
to secrets being included in gRPC request logs if drivers did not
implement custom sanitizer logic. To opt in to this feature, CSI
drivers should implement the `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets' field as
well as implement logic for backwards compatibility. 

 BUILDING TAMPER-PROOF MEDIA APPS: C2PA VS CPP DEEP DIVE FOR
DEVELOPERS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This technical deep dive compares C2PA (the industry standard backed
by Adobe and Sony) with the emerging Content Provenance Protocol (CPP)
for building tamper-proof media applications that prove content
authenticity. CPP's key differentiator is its "Completeness
Invariant," which uses XOR hash sums to mathematically detect deleted
evidence—a critical capability for legal proceedings, insurance
claims, and regulatory compliance that C2PA cannot provide
architecturally. The article provides Swift and Python implementations
of cryptographic patterns, including Secure Enclave signing, Merkle
tree construction, RFC 3161 timestamp anchoring, and
privacy-preserving human attestation without storing biometric data. 

 THE DUAL-USE DILEMMA OF AI: MALICIOUS LLMS (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While LLMs can be a useful tool for defenders, they can also be used
by attackers. WormGPT was the first malicious LLM that was released.
It is still being developed. KawaiiGPT is an open-source malicious
LLM. This article analyzes the efficacy of these models at producing
ransomware notes, data exfiltration scripts, and lateral movement
detection.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE SO-CON 2026 AGENDA IS LIVE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 SO-CON 2026 (April 13–14, Arlington, VA) brings together the
community shaping the future of Attack Path Management [11]. Hear from
Kevin Mandia, HD Moore, JPMorgan Chase, and leading APM
practitioners—plus hands-on training led by real adversary experts.
Training students get a free event pass. View the full agenda here
[10]. 

 AWESOME-BLACKHAT-ARSENAL (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Whether you're in red teaming, blue teaming, appsec, or OSINT, this
list helps you explore and leverage the best tools demonstrated live
by security professionals across the world. 

 SECURITY DETECTIONS MCP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Security Detections MCP is an MCP server that enables LLMs to query a
unified database of over 7,200 Sigma, Splunk ESCU, Elastic, and KQL
security detection rules through natural language. The tool features
SQLite FTS5-powered full-text search across detection fields, MITRE
ATT&CK mapping, CVE coverage lookup, and process name filtering, with
token-optimized analysis tools that reduce data transfer by 25x
compared to traditional queries. Security teams can integrate this
with Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, or VS Code to perform coverage
analysis, identify detection gaps against threat profiles, and
generate ATT&CK Navigator layers directly from their AI assistant. 

 BANDJACKS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Bandjacks is a comprehensive Cyber Threat Intel system that quickly
extracts MITRE ATT&CK techniques from threat reports, builds a
knowledge graph of threat actors, and utilizes LLM response caching
for faster extraction, among other features.

 MICROSOFT GAVE FBI A SET OF BITLOCKER ENCRYPTION KEYS TO UNLOCK
SUSPECTS' LAPTOPS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The FBI has obtained a warrant compelling Microsoft to hand over
BitLocker recovery keys for three seized laptops, allowing agents to
decrypt the drives despite full‑disk encryption. BitLocker recovery
keys are often stored in Microsoft's cloud, enabling lawful access but
also raising privacy and security fears if the company or its keys are
compromised. 

 MICROSOFT FLAGS MULTI-STAGE AITM PHISHING AND BEC ATTACKS TARGETING
ENERGY FIRMS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft describes a layered phishing and BEC campaign against
energy companies that abuses trusted services like SharePoint and
OneDrive to deliver links leading to adversary-in-the-middle
credential theft pages. Attackers then use stolen credentials and
session cookies to set stealthy inbox rules, launch large internal and
external phishing waves, and bypass MFA using tailored phishing kits
and social engineering, prompting defenders to adopt
phishing-resistant MFA, conditional access, continuous access
evaluation, and robust anti-phishing controls. 

 IRELAND WANTS TO GIVE ITS COPS SPYWARE, ABILITY TO CRACK ENCRYPTION
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Ireland has announced the release of a new communications bill that
seeks to provide sweeping updates to its decades-old
telecommunications legislation. Among the provisions in the bill,
Ireland is looking to provide law enforcement with the ability to
utilize spyware as well as the ability to intercept encrypted
messages. Ireland is looking to follow the framework laid out by the
EU Commission in 2024.
