 INFOSTEALERS ARE NOW THE #1 DRIVER OF IDENTITY ATTACKS — LEARN TO
DEFEND AGAINST THEM (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Identity is the new attack surface, and infostealers are at the
frontline - fuelling ransomware, fraud, and data breaches for bad
actors. Low costs and easy access mean they're here to stay.

Download this Flashpoint guide [5] to learn:

 	* Which strains of infostealers dominate underground markets — and
how they're deployed,
 	* How stolen identities are weaponized and what you can do to
monitor + respond [4], 
 	* Why early visibility into compromised accounts is key to
neutralizing infostealer attacks,
 	* Methods for using the logs you already have to close security
gaps.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 US CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE HIT BY SUSPECTED FOREIGN CYBERATTACK
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) confirmed that it had
suffered a cyberattack after detecting unauthorized access to its
networks. Officials who discovered the breach are concerned that
emails between CBO and congressional offices may have been exposed. A
foreign actor is suspected. 

 DANGEROUS RUNC FLAWS COULD ALLOW HACKERS TO ESCAPE DOCKER CONTAINERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Three critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-31133, CVE-2025-52565, and
CVE-2025-52881) in the runC container runtime used by Docker and
Kubernetes allow attackers to exploit symlink races and bind-mount
redirections to gain root-level write access to the host system,
bypassing container isolation by manipulating /dev/null, /dev/console,
and /proc filesystem mounts during container initialization. The flaws
affect all runC versions for CVE-2025-31133 and CVE-2025-52881, while
CVE-2025-52565 impacts versions 1.0.0-rc3 and later, with patches
available in runC versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3, 1.4.0-rc.3 and above.
Security teams should immediately update to patched runC versions,
enable user namespaces without mapping host root into containers,
implement rootless containers where possible, and monitor for
suspicious symlink behaviors that could indicate exploitation
attempts. 

 NEW LANDFALL SPYWARE EXPLOITED SAMSUNG ZERO-DAY VIA WHATSAPP MESSAGES
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A threat actor exploited CVE-2025-21042, a critical out-of-bounds
write zero-day in Samsung's libimagecodec.quram.so library, to deploy
LandFall spyware via malicious .DNG images sent through WhatsApp to
Samsung Galaxy users (S22, S23, S24, Z Fold 4, and Z Flip 4) in the
Middle East from July 2024 until Samsung patched it in April 2025. The
spyware delivered a malformed DNG file with an embedded ZIP archive
containing a loader and SELinux policy manipulator, enabling extensive
spying such as microphone/call recording, location tracking, and
access to photos, contacts, SMS, call logs, files, and browsing
history while maintaining persistence and evading detection. Security
professionals should ensure devices are updated with April 2025
patches, disable automatic media downloads, enable Android's Advanced
Protection or iOS Lockdown Mode for high-risk users, and monitor for
similar DNG exploitation patterns, given recent trends of commercial
spyware leveraging image vulnerabilities.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BYPASSING ENROLLMENT RESTRICTIONS TO BREAK BYOD BARRIERS IN INTUNE
(15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Administrators can configure Intune to block bring your own device
(BYOD) enrollment using the device enrollment restriction, which can
prevent attackers from enrolling rogue devices after stealing login
credentials. If personal devices are allowed for other operating
systems (such as Android), attackers can send the Entra join request
as that OS and then check in and complete enrollment as Windows.
Otherwise, attackers can manipulate the check in XML to mock a device
ID or mock Azure Virtual Desktop. 

 FROM KEY SPRAWL TO SCALABLE CONTROL: RETHINKING SSH ACCESS (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Static SSH keys can present security issues if they are not rotated
often enough or shared between teams or with external contractors, and
can also add to management overhead. SSH certificates present a more
modern alternative in which users present their public key to a
centralized CA, which signs a certificate based on it, which can be
used for a time limited authentication. This article presents an
implementation of SSH certificates using Hashicorp Vault and Boundary.


 BUILDING SECURITY IN OPEN SOURCE FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES: OPENSSF AT
OPEN SOURCE FINANCE FORUM (OSFF) NYC (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 OpenSSF sponsored the Open Source in Finance Forum to address
critical security challenges in financial services, where 80-90% of
modern software supply chains rely on open source software, including
71% of AI components, highlighting emerging risks such as malware
hidden in AI model weights, poisoned training data, and identity-based
intrusions that now account for 30% of financial sector attacks. The
organization is implementing proactive defense measures, including
Model Signing v1.0 for AI integrity verification, MLSecOps frameworks
for full AI lifecycle security, transparency tools like OpenSSF
Scorecard, OSV, and GUAC, plus policy engagement across the US and EU
to secure open source from development to deployment. Financial
services security professionals should adopt OpenSSF's security
frameworks and tools, implement model signing for AI components,
establish MLSecOps practices throughout the AI lifecycle, and actively
participate in cross-industry collaboration to address supply chain
vulnerabilities while connecting maintainers with the organizations
that depend on their work.

 MY AWS ACCOUNT GOT HACKED - HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED (10 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 A cloud architect discovered that their personal AWS account was
breached when they received a DKIM verification email. They then
removed the attacker's access and found that the attacker had created
four IAM accounts for backdoor access, launched a large EC2 instance
(possibly for cryptomining), created an AWS Organization and a new
account, and used Resource Explorer to search for additional access.
The post walks the reader through the author's full process, from
discovery to incident response to root cause analysis. 

 WHAT MAKES RANSOMWARE GROUPS SUCCESSFUL? (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ransomware gangs thrive through automation, customization, and
advanced tools, rapidly evolving their tactics to outpace defenders.
AI accelerates attacks and facilitates phishing, while tailored
ransomware operations employ strong encryption and sophisticated
extortion tactics. These groups operate like efficient SaaS
enterprises, and the recommendation is to focus on defense against
attacker techniques and fast, automated responses. 

 RANSOMVIBING APPEARS IN VS CODE EXTENSIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A ransomware-infected VS Code extension, "susvsex," was found on the
Visual Studio Marketplace. It utilizes GitHub for command and control,
encrypts files, and uploads them for extortion, but its malicious
intent was clearly evident. Due to poor coding and a hardcoded
decryption key, its threat is currently low. The incident highlights
gaps in extension security.
