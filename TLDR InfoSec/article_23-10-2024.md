ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACKERS EXPLOIT ROUNDCUBE WEBMAIL FLAW TO STEAL EMAIL CREDENTIALS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Russian cybersecurity company Positive Technologies has detected an
ongoing campaign that exploits a medium-severity stored XSS flaw in
Roundcube webmail. The flaw lies in the improper processing of SVG
elements in emails which bypass syntax checks. The threat actor sends
an email with no visible text and a .doc attachment which contains a
hidden payload disguised as a href that injects an unauthorized login
form into the HTML message. 

 50,000 FILES EXPOSED IN NIDEC RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Nidec suffered a ransomware attack in August where hackers stole
50,694 files after obtaining domain credentials. It refused ransom
demands, so attackers have leaked its documents on the dark web. 

 CISCO DISABLES DEVHUB ACCESS AFTER SECURITY BREACH (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Cisco has disabled public access to DevHub as it investigates a
breach from earlier this month. The attackers have sold customer data,
which includes source code, credentials, and certificates from major
companies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AUTOMATING CLIENT SIDE PATH TRAVERSAL DISCOVERY (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Client Side Path Traversal (CSPT) is a vulnerability that occurs when
a client can provide path traversal characters (../) in a request to
modify a different request. This can be chained with Open Redirect
vulnerabilities to control the response returned to the client. This
post describes the process of creating a Chrome extension to automate
the discovery of CSPT vulnerabilities using dynamic analysis. 

 APPLYING LLMS AND GENAI TO CYBERSECURITY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post shares various resources and tactics for applying LLMs and
Generative AI to CyberSecurity. It highlights how LLMs are being used
for security tasks, sparking interest in the field. Various studies
and projects are exploring LLM capabilities in code analysis and bug
hunting. The potential of augmenting language models with tools and
agentic approaches can be instrumental for various cybersecurity jobs.


 FINDING VULNERABILITY VARIANTS AT SCALE (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BlackWing security found vulnerabilities in a JPEG processing program
called jpeg-recompress by analyzing its source code. The company
identified two vulnerabilities in the program related to buffer
overflow and integer overflow. It discovered over 40 projects with
similar vulnerabilities by using automated and manual searches.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE API SECURITY PROBLEM NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 AI is helping developers build APIs 200% faster, making it impossible
for security teams to see the full picture. Join StackHawk's Joni
Klippert and CISO Scott Gerlach to for an open and honest discussion
[11] about this growing security challenge, and why source-code level
API discovery might be the solution. Join the chat [11] 👋 

 HYDDEN (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Hydden creates a single data layer across IAM, identity governance
and administration (IGA), privileged access management (PAM), and
identity threat detection and response (ITDR) solutions. 

 CODEPENDENCE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Codependence is a JavaScript utility for checking dependencies to
ensure they're up-to-date or match a specified version. 

 VULNCOV (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Vulncov is a tool that correlates Semgrep SAST scans with Python test
code coverage to determine which unit tests run vulnerable code to
help prioritize findings. It includes a self-hosted LLM that suggests
bug fixes.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CHALLENGES WITH IP SPOOFING IN CLOUD ENVIRONMENTS (7 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 IP spoofing is an attack technique where attackers report an
incorrect IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header to bypass rate
limiting or IP based restrictions. Nearly a third of organizations
that use Datadog's product receive X-Forwarded-For headers but 25% of
those also receive suspicious X-Forwarded-For headers. To defend
against this attack, use trusted vendor headers, add a custom header
at the edge, or instruct frameworks to parse the header to the depth
appropriate for your environment. 

 MANDIANT: 70% OF EXPLOITED FLAWS DISCLOSED IN 2023 WERE ZERO DAYS (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Analysts from Google's Mandiant warn that threat actors are getting
more sophisticated. Specifically, 70% of the vulnerabilities that were
reported as being actively exploited in 2023 were zero days. Mandiant
also reported that the time to exploit a newly disclosed vulnerability
has dropped to 5 days from 32 days in 2021-2022. 

 SIGN-IN TO AWS CONSOLE MOBILE APPLICATION WITH AN AWS ACCESS PORTAL
OR THIRD-PARTY IDP URL (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AWS has added the ability to sign in via SSO to the AWS Console
mobile app. Once a user provides their sign-in URL in the application,
it will redirect to the sign-in URL and provide a similar experience
as the web login flow. This post includes a walkthrough of the new
sign-in flow.
