 NEW FAKE LEDGER DATA BREACH EMAILS TRY TO STEAL CRYPTO WALLETS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ledger is a hardware cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to
store, manage, and sell cryptocurrencies that use a multi-word
recovery phrase for securing the wallets. A new phishing campaign is
targeting Ledger owners with an email stating that a recovery phrase
breach occurred and urging them to verify if their recovery phrase is
secure. The link takes users to a fake Ledger page that prompts them
to enter their recovery phrases and then transmits the phrase back to
the attackers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURING CI/CD: DON'T USE LONG-LIVED API TOKENS, USE OPENID CONNECT
INSTEAD (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 OpenID Connect is a mechanism for applications to authenticate
without requiring long-lived credentials like API keys. This post
provides tutorials for connecting GitHub and AWS to authenticate from
GitHub Actions via OpenID Connect as well as sample workflows to build
and push Docker containers to ECR and plan/apply Terraform changes.
The post concludes by describing how OpenID Connect can be used with
Amplify. 

 LDAP ENUMERATION: UNVEILING THE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD OF ACTIVE
DIRECTORY (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 team explains how LDAP,
while essential for Active Directory management, is frequently
exploited by threat actors like Stately Taurus and BlackCat ransomware
groups who use tools such as AdFind and SharpHound for malicious
reconnaissance. While detecting malicious LDAP activity is challenging
due to high volumes of legitimate traffic, organizations can implement
effective detection strategies by monitoring suspicious attributes,
analyzing user context, and establishing behavioral baselines. The
article concludes by highlighting how Palo Alto Networks' products
like Cortex XDR, XSIAM, and Xpanse can help security teams detect and
prevent LDAP-based attacks. 

 EXPLOITING REFLECTED INPUT VIA THE RANGE HEADER (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reflected input in web attacks can sometimes be made exploitable by
using the Range header to extract specific sections from a server
response. By combining this technique with desync or header injection,
attackers can turn previously unexploitable vectors into fully
exploitable ones. The ability to manipulate the Range header can lead
to successful attacks by extracting targeted content from server
responses.
