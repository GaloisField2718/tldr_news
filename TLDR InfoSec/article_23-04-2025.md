ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BUG HUNTER TRICKED SSL.COM INTO ISSUING CERT FOR ALIBABA CLOUD DOMAIN
IN 5 STEPS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A security researcher discovered a flaw in SSL.com's domain
validation flow that allowed a potential attacker to obtain a
certificate for a site they do not control. SSL.com allows for domain
validation using a _validation-contactemail TXT record that contains
an email, which it then sends a link to. The bug involved SSL.com
using the email's domain for validation, regardless of the domain
hosting the TXT record. 

 MANY MALWARE CAMPAIGNS LINKED TO PROTON66 NETWORK (3 MINUTE READ) [6]


 The Russian network "Proton66" has allegedly been the backbone for
multiple cyberattacks since January. Security researchers have linked
this hosting service to SuperBlack ransomware, fake Google Play sites,
XWorm malware, Strela Stealer, and WeaXor ransomware, primarily
targeting the technology and financial sectors globally. 

 MARKS & SPENCER CONFIRMS CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT AMID ONGOING
DISRUPTION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Marks & Spencer has confirmed that it is managing a cyber incident
that requires operational changes to protect its customers. The
retailer's stores remain open, with the website and app functioning
normally. However, customers have reported issues with payment
terminals and disruptions to order pickup. The company has engaged
cybersecurity experts and notified authorities, but has not disclosed
the nature of the attack or whether customer data was affected.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UEBA - A KEY DETECTION INGREDIENT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) can be leveraged to
incorporate additional context in detections to reduce false
positives. This post enhances a YARA-L rule by adding login counts and
countries from the last 30 days to detect Azure command interpreter
logins after multiple failures. Other example alerts that can be
enriched with UEBA are also provided. 

 ATTACKING MY LANDLORD'S BOILER (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog explores how something as simple as heating can be a
powerful motivator to investigate new ways to connect to devices. The
author needed more control over their heating and decided to integrate
the existing thermostat with Home Assistant for smarter climate
control while leaving no trace. 

 JUMPING THE LINE: HOW MCP SERVERS CAN ATTACK YOU BEFORE YOU EVER USE
THEM (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 There is a critical vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
known as "line jumping" where malicious servers can inject prompt
instructions into tool descriptions before any tools are invoked. This
bypasses security controls, allowing attackers to manipulate AI models
to exfiltrate code, insert vulnerabilities, or suppress security
alerts.

 WHY DEI IS KEY FOR A CYBER SAFE FUTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Embracing diversity at a critical moment in cybersecurity enables us
to utilize all available resources to address the cyber skills gap.
Diverse teams are also better equipped to address complex threats with
a broader viewpoint. Common arguments against DEI, which stem from a
scarcity mindset, ignore the staffing shortages that many
organizations face. 

 ANNOUNCING THE AGENT2AGENT PROTOCOL (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol complements MCP and defines a
protocol for agents to communicate with each other. Agents advertise
their capabilities in “Agent Cards,” which allows for the
completion of “tasks” and the production of “artifacts.”
Notably, A2A includes built-in authorization and authentication
schemes that are not present in MCP. 

 OUTSIDE EXPERTS PICK UP THE SLACK ON SAFETY TESTING ON OPENAI'S
NEWEST MODEL RELEASE (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 SplxAI researchers found that GPT-4.1 is three times more likely to
go off-topic and permit intentional misuse compared to GPT-4o, with
higher error rates across most safety categories, despite using
recommended prompting techniques. Creating effective safety guardrails
for GPT-4.1 required experts to spend 4-5 hours developing entirely
new prompts, highlighting challenges for organizations that might
simply port over previous guidance. This safety testing gap coincides
with OpenAI's revised policies, which prioritize only "severe" harms
and exclude front-end testing for risks such as generating
disinformation, drawing criticism that companies are cutting corners
on safety.
