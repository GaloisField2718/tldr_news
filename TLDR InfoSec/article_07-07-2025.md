ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PROVIDER OF COVERT SURVEILLANCE APP SPILLS PASSWORDS FOR 62,000 USERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Catwatchful, an Android spyware app marketed for "stealthy
monitoring," leaked sensitive data from 62,000 users due to an SQL
injection vulnerability. The breach exposed email addresses,
plain-text passwords, and monitoring data. 

 RECRUITING SOFTWARE MAKER EXPOSES NEARLY 26M RESUMES (2 MINUTE READ)

 INGRAM MICRO OUTAGE CAUSED BY SAFEPAY RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE
READ) [7]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YET ANOTHER ZIP TRICK WRITEUP (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This write-up explains how to create a "schizophrenic ZIP file". This
type of ZIP file appears differently depending on the parser used. The
trick relies on how parsers locate the Central Directory, with some
using the offset field and others calculating it from the size. As a
result, each method points to different Central Directories containing
different file content, allowing the same ZIP file to display
different contents depending on which parser opens it. This enables
malicious files to be opened without the user's knowledge. 

 RULES FILES FOR SAFER VIBE CODING (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Studies have shown that code generated by LLMs contains many security
vulnerabilities. Developers should move security earlier in the
development process by creating rules files for IDEs like Cursor,
which include security guardrails and instructions. This post offers
guidance on writing prompts for these rules files. Early research
indicates that simply adding the word “secure” to a prompt can
significantly reduce vulnerabilities. 

 PROFILING TRADETRAITOR: TACTICS, HISTORY & DEFENSES (5 MINUTE READ)
[10]

billion through social engineering and cloud attacks, compromising

CloudTrail logs, MFA, and credential monitoring.

 INSTAGRAM USES EXPIRING CERTIFICATES AS SINGLE DAY TLS CERTIFICATES
(4 MINUTE READ) [17]

that Instagram uses certificates with a lifetime of 8 days, replaces
them daily, and uses unique certificates for instagram.com and
