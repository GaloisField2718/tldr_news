ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACKERS SPOOF MICROSOFT ADFS LOGIN PAGES TO STEAL CREDENTIALS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Abnormal Security has detected a new phishing campaign targeting
education, healthcare, and government organizations' ADFS. The
attackers send emails to targets, impersonating their company's IT
team, with a request that they sign in to accept new policies or other
routine changes, steal the login credentials and MFA, and then
redirect the victims to the login page. 

 LIVE CHAT BLOG #2: CISCO WEBEX CONNECT - ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF CHATS
HISTORIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A vulnerability was discovered in Cisco's Webex Chat that allowed
unauthorized access to the chat histories of many organizations,
including internal and customer-facing help desks. The flaw was
related to the use of the clientKey as a secretKey in API calls, which
allowed attackers to read chat histories by exploiting specific
parameters. The issue was reported to Cisco in July 2024 and patches
were released to address the security vulnerability. 

 NETGEAR URGES USERS TO UPGRADE TWO FLAWS IMPACTING WIFI ROUTER MODELS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Netgear has identified critical flaws in multiple WiFi router models
(XR1000, XR1000v2, and XR500) and is urging users to update their
firmware as soon as possible. The vulnerabilities include a remote
code execution issue and an authentication bypass vulnerability that
can be exploited by attackers without user interaction. This post
includes the firmware versions to download the patches as well as
instructions on how to upgrade.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW WE BUILT AN APPSEC AI THAT SECURITY RESEARCHERS AGREE WITH 96% OF
THE TIME (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Semgrep built Semgrep Assistant's auto triage function to
automatically classify a finding as a true or false positive by
sending a minimal amount of code to an LLM. To benchmark the model,
Semgrep's research team labeled 2,000 findings and then the system was
evaluated against it. The original Assistant system was able to score
a 90% success rate, but through optimizations around models,
prompting, and context the team managed to increase the true positive
rate to 96%. 

 INSIDE IMESSAGE-EXPORTER: REVERSE ENGINEERING APPLE'S TYPEDSTREAM
FORMAT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple uses a proprietary and undocumented serialization format for
serializing iMessage data. This researcher breaks down the process of
reverse engineering the binary format, noting the patterns found, and
shows how those assumptions are translated into the imessage-exporter
tool. 

 LINUX DETECTION ENGINEERING - A CONTINUATION ON PERSISTENCE
MECHANISMS (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post is part of a three part series from Elastic Security
that covers various persistence mechanisms and utilizes PANIX, a
custom-built Linux persistence tool. It goes in-depth on various
techniques like Dynamic Linker Hijacking that exploit LD_PRELOAD and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH to inject malicious libraries, Kernel Module
Persistence, Web Shell persistence, and system account SSH backdoors.
The post also provides key detection and mitigation strategies file,
configuration monitoring, as well as examples of utilizing
ElasticSearch and OSquery for hunting.

 StokeKeeper is an experimental EDR evasion framework for research
purposes. 

 INTRODUCING NATURAL LANGUAGE CODE POLICIES IN DRYRUN SECURITY (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 DryRun Security has introduced Natural Language Code Policies (NLCP)
to help AppSec teams identify critical code changes without drowning
in alerts. NLCP uses plain language to create policy checks, making it
easier to spot high-impact vulnerabilities. 

 VMINER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Vminer is a tool that aims to simplify the retrieval of data from
virtual machines without utilizing guest tools or working with memory
dumps. It supports multiple guest OS and architectures and offers
features like getting process information and backtraces. To use it,
you attach it to the VM process. Required PDBs are automatically
downloaded for Windows guests.

 ALMOST 1 IN 10 PEOPLE USE THE SAME FOUR-DIGIT PIN (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) analyzed a corpus of 29
million four digit pins from Have I Been Pwned? Some of the most
popular pins are expected keyscans, 1234, and number repetitions
(1111, etc). Some other more interesting trends are highlighted such
as 0229 and 2902 being less popular than other surrounding pins as
they represent leap days. 

 CVSS IS DEAD TO US (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The curl team abandoned the CVSS system in favor of four security
levels ranging from critical to low for use in their bug bounty
system. They cited evidence from previous incidents, where CVSS
calculators overstated the impact of a vulnerability that is only
present in very niche configurations. One issue that the team notes is
that even though the CVSS score is not mandatory in CVE filings, it is
often added by CISA as an enrichment. 

 ROBOCALLERS POSING AS FCC FRAUD PREVENTION TEAM CALL FCC STAFF (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Scammers using Telnyx's VoIP service made nearly 1,800 robocalls
impersonating a fictitious FCC "Fraud Prevention Team," ironically
targeting FCC staff and their families among others. The FCC has
proposed a $4.5M fine against Telnyx for allegedly failing to properly
verify customer identities through Know Your Customer (KYC)
procedures, though Telnyx denies these accusations. The scammers,
operating under "MarioCop" accounts with suspicious discrepancies
between their registered location and IP addresses, attempted to
defraud victims by demanding $1,000 in Google gift cards to avoid
supposed jail time.
