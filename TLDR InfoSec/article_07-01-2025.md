STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW ATTACKERS ABUSE SERVERLESS SERVICES TO HARVEST SENSITIVE DATA
FROM ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post provides an overview of how attackers exploit environment
variables from serverless devices post-exploitation. When secrets are
stored directly in environment variables, they can be leaked by an
attacker that can achieve code execution on the function. As
permissions are generally provided to the serverless execution
environment via environment variables, they can also be acquired by
the attacker to pivot to other services in the account that the
function can access. To mitigate these issues, utilize Secrets Manager
services, audit functions, scope roles to least privilege, and alert
on abuse. 

 HOW TO BUILD AN OFFENSIVE AI SECURITY AGENT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post walks through the process of building a POC for an
offensive AI security agent that was able to analyze a JavaScript file
to discover API endpoints and detect a vulnerability. The author
provided the AI agent with 4 “tools” to find endpoints, format an
API request, execute the test, and analyze the results. The post also
provides some lessons learned, such as the importance of effective
prompting, the power of agentic workflows, and the strengths of Claude
3.5 Sonnet for code writing.

 FROM REMEDIATION TO MITIGATION: ADDRESSING INSECURE-BY-DESIGN FLAWS
(6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Insecure-by-Design flaws are vulnerabilities inherent to the design
of a system. They require a full redesign of the system remediate.
These vulnerabilities should first be mitigated by implementing
guardrails and monitoring tools. Once mitigations are in place, a slow
sunsetting process can be started to reduce downstream impacts.
