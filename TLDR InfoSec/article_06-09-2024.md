ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PLANNED PARENTHOOD CONFIRMS CYBER-ATTACK AS RANSOMHUB THREATENS TO
LEAK DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Planned Parenthood in Montana experienced a cyber-attack on August
28. It is working with federal law enforcement and cybersecurity
experts to investigate and restore systems. Ransomware group RansomHub
claims to have stolen 93GB of data and has threatened to leak it
unless paid. 

 REVIVAL HIJACK SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK THREATENS 22K PYPI PACKAGES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 JFrog has detected a new attack, dubbed Revival Hijack, where
attackers register a package under the name of a previously deleted
package. 22k packages are vulnerable to this attack because PyPi makes
package names available immediately upon deletion. JFrog took action
to mitigate this vulnerability by registering packages under the name
of more popular vulnerable projects. 

 GOOGLE CONFIRMS CVE-2024-32896 EXPLOITED IN THE WILD, RELEASES
ANDROID SECURITY PATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google has released its monthly security updates for the Android
operating system, addressing a known security flaw that it said has
come under active exploitation in the wild. The high-severity
vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-32896 (CVSS score: 7.8), allows
privilege escalation in the Android Framework component.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A SECURITY ANALYSIS OF AZURE DEVOPS JOB EXECUTION (15 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Azure DevOps is a key tool in CI/CD practices - particularly its
Azure Pipelines feature for automating code building and testing. This
post explores the server-side processes when pipelines are triggered,
focusing on potential security risks and the importance of protecting
against unauthorized access and data breaches in modern development
workflows. 

 THREAT MODELING AUTOMATION: OPPORTUNITIES, CHALLENGES, AND THE ROLE
OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional threat modeling struggles with scalability due to needing
dedicated security resources as well as engineering resources to
understand both the security aspects and application components.
Recent innovations in the threat modeling process are meant to
integrate threat modeling throughout the SDLC as well as offering
tools for diagramming or threat models as code. With the advent of
LLMs, it could be possible to generate threat models directly from
source code. Current efforts such as STRIDE GPT can generate threat
models from a natural language description. 

 AVOIDING SECURITY INCIDENTS DUE TO REQUEST COALESCING (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Web caching is often utilized to speed up costly calculations or
decrease response times by maintaining a copy of data closer to users.
Request coalescing is when Amazon CloudFront is used as a CDN and sees
requests for the same cache key come in simultaneously and the CDN
waits for the first response to be cached and then uses the cached
copy for the following responses. Wiz found an unexpected behavior
where Amazon CloudFront was ignoring the Cache-Control: no-cache
header and sending sensitive cached content to users via request
coalescing. To prevent this behavior, users must configure the managed
cache policy CachingDisabled for those cache keys or set the minimum
TTL for the cache behavior to 0 AND configure the origin to send the
Cache-Control: no-cache header.

 ANNOUNCING AWS KMS ECDH SUPPORT (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AWS has announced support in KMS for asymmetric keys using ECDH. Each
party generates a key using the same key spec and selects
KEY_AGGREEMENT for the usage. The parties then retrieve and exchange
their public key from KMS. Each party can then utilize the other
party's public key and their KEY_AGREEMENT key to call the new
DeriveSharedSecret API to derive an asymmetric key that can be
utilized for secure communication. This post provides a walkthrough
for a sample use case of end-to-end encryption using the new
DeriveSharedSecret API.
