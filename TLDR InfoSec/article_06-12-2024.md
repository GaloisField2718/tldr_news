ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 7-ZIP VULNERABILITY LETS ATTACKERS EXECUTE ARBITRARY CODE (1 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 7-Zip has released an update for a high (7.8) vulnerability that can
allow for RCE. The vulnerability exists in the implementation of the
Zstandard decompression where improper validation of user-supplied
data can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. It
allows attackers to run arbitrary code under the current user. 

 760,000 EMPLOYEE RECORDS FROM SEVERAL MAJOR FIRMS LEAKED ONLINE (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A massive data leak exposed over 760,000 employees' information from
major organizations like Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.
Originating from last year's MOVEit hack, the breach is attributed to
the Cl0p ransomware gang. It revealed names, emails, and work details,
potentially enabling sophisticated social engineering attacks. 

 TELECOM GIANT BT GROUP HIT BY BLACK BASTA RANSOMWARE (4 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 The Black Basta ransomware gang has attacked BT Group's Conferencing
division, stealing 500 GB of sensitive data. The telecom giant claims
limited impact, with core services unaffected. The leak could include
financial information and even passport copies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USING VBS ENCLAVES FOR ANTI-CHEAT PURPOSES (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Virtualization-based security enclaves are a Windows 11 feature that
allows code to be run in a Secure Enclave that runs at a higher
privilege mode than the kernel. The author of this post decided to
attempt to write a simple Pong game that would run the core game logic
in a VBS enclave and only run the code to write the display and read
keypresses in the user mode. The theory was that if a game could run
in a VBS enclave, then an attacker would only be able to cheat if they
hooked into the Windows boot chain before the VBS enclave was loaded.
Ultimately, the author found that the performance and API limitations
that result from using VBS enclaves makes it an infeasible option. 

 HOW TO USE AWS RESOURCE CONTROL POLICIES (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS Resource Control Policies (RCPs) are like Service Control
Policies (SCPs) for setting access limitations across your entire AWS
Organization. RCPs help control resource sharing and enforce policy
standards, making it easier to manage data perimeters and prevent
undesired actions from external accounts. Deploy RCPs carefully across
your organization to avoid potential issues and ensure security
measures are maintained. 

 MOONLOCK'S 2024 MACOS THREAT REPORT (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The 2024 macOS threat report by Moonlock Lab highlights a significant
increase in malware targeting macOS users, with a focus on stealers.
The rise of malware-as-a-service (MaaS) has made macOS threats more
accessible and cost-effective, leading to an evolution in
cybercriminal operations and techniques. The report emphasizes the
need for users to stay vigilant as macOS malware continues to evolve
rapidly and adapt to evade detection.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW DO YOU GET PROACTIVE ABOUT VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT? (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Cyber threats are inter-connected. Vulnerabilities are gateways in
your attack surface that can be exploited to deploy ransomware,
infostealers, and other cyber threats. Learn how you can build a
strong vulnerability management program (VMP) [11] and reduce your
attack surface with this comprehensive guide by Flashpoint [11]. 

 OVERSIGHT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Oversight is a modular LLM reverse engineering, red teaming, and
vulnerability research platform. It currently has a single loader that
supports loading plugins directly from Hugging Face but more are
planned. 

 PERMCHECK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 PermCheck is a little tool that checks if the files in a PHP project
have the executable bit set properly. 

 INTRODUCING NACHOVPN: ONE VPN SERVER TO PWN THEM ALL (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Amberwolf's NachoVPN is an open-source tool that demonstrates how
vulnerabilities in popular corporate VPN clients can be exploited by
attackers to gain remote code execution. NachoVPN simulates rogue VPN
servers to showcase insecure behaviors in VPN clients and help
security professionals understand and mitigate risks. Detailed
advisories for vulnerabilities in clients like Palo Alto GlobalProtect
and SonicWall NetExtender are also provided to aid organizations in
protecting against threats.

 EMPLOYEE LAWSUIT ACCUSES APPLE OF SPYING ON ITS WORKERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 An Apple employee has accused the company of privacy violations due
to its monitoring of personal iCloud accounts when using personal
devices for work. The employee alleges that Apple-provided devices
have too many restrictions to be used, virtually forcing employees to
use personal devices. 

 AWS ANNOUNCES DECLARATIVE POLICIES (1 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AWS has announced a new type of management policy for AWS
Organizations. Declarative policies enforce a security baseline that
persists even when services add new APIs or features and when new
principals or accounts are added to an Organization. Currently,
declarative policies support blocking public access to VPCs, blocking
public access to EBS snapshots, and various configurations for EC2
such as restricting available AMIs. 

 EU COUNCIL PROPOSES NEW CYBERSECURITY LAWS (1 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The EU has adopted two new cybersecurity laws establishing a
pan-European Cybersecurity Alert System and introducing certification
schemes for managed security services. These measures aim to enhance
cooperative threat detection, improve information sharing, and
strengthen cyber resilience across member states through coordinated
technological and regulatory approaches.
