 WE TESTED 13 WAF SOLUTIONS IN REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS. HERE'S WHAT WE
FOUND (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Security researchers from Check Point's open-appsec tested the
efficacy of several leading WAF solutions using a comprehensive
dataset: 1,040,242 legitimate HTTP requests from 692 real websites
[4], and 73,924 malicious payloads from common attack vectors.

Based on these tests, they ranked each solution's true positive rate
— cases where it detected and blocked malicious requests —
compared with false positive cases where the solution blocked
legitimate requests.

→ See the full scores and test data [4] for leading WAF solutions
from Azure, AWS, Cloudflare, Imperva, and others on the open-appsec
blog [4].

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GRUBHUB CONFIRMS DATA BREACH AFFECTING CUSTOMERS AND DRIVERS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Grubhub reported a data breach through a third-party provider that
affects customers, merchants, and drivers. Hackers accessed personal
information including names, emails, phone numbers, and partial
payment data for some campus diners. While hashed passwords were
exposed, bank details and Social Security numbers weren't compromised.


 ZYXEL WON'T PATCH NEWLY EXPLOITED FLAWS IN END-OF-LIFE ROUTERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Zyxel has issued a security advisory about actively exploited flaws
in CPE series devices that it has no plans to fix. VulnCheck released
the full details of two CVEs - one is for insecure default passwords
and the other is for improper command validation leading to command
injection. According to FOFA and Censys, there are over 1,500
potentially vulnerable devices that are internet exposed. 

 AMD SEV-SNP VULNERABILITY ALLOWS MALICIOUS MICROCODE INJECTION WITH
ADMIN ACCESS (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BUILD IN SECURITY FROM THE GROUND UP? (5 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Security has a unique position as a systems requirement. While
"building security from the ground up" is a popular way of starting,
using established security mechanisms and following best practices
might be more practical. 

 PHISHING FOR REFRESH TOKENS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article examines an Attacker-in-the-Middle technique for
stealing access and refresh tokens from the OAuth 2.0 authorization
flow. The attacker first allows the user to go through the initial
steps of the OAuth 2.0 flow until a response from the upstream server
that has a header containing “nativeclient?code=“ is seen. This
code can be used to request access and refresh tokens from the
/oauth2/token endpoint. 

 8 MILLION REQUESTS LATER, WE MADE THE SOLARWINDS SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK
LOOK AMATEUR (38 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Watchtowr Labs researchers discovered abandoned Amazon S3 buckets and
monitored incoming requests to them. They found vulnerabilities in how
these abandoned buckets were accessed and used by organizations,
highlighting security risks. They registered and monitored the
abandoned buckets to raise awareness and improve internet security.
