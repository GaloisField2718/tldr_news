 AI AGENTS THAT ACTUALLY ACCELERATE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most "AI for security" tools don't actually make your workflows
faster or easier. Sumo Logic's Dojo AI [4] is a different beast,
deploying specialized agents that work together to triage alerts,
explain what triggered them, and write queries for you.

>> Mobot lets you use natural language to run an investigation 
>> Query Agent turns natural language into precise searches for faster
root cause analysis 
>> Summary Agent explains each insight so you know where to start your
investigation

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EVEREST RANSOMWARE CLAIMS BREACH AT NISSAN, SAYS 900GB OF DATA STOLEN
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Everest ransomware group claimed to have breached Nissan Motor
Corporation, posting screenshots on their dark web leak site showing
directory structures with 900GB of allegedly stolen data, including
dealership information, financial records, and operational
documentation in .csv, .txt, .pgp, and .xls formats. The group issued
a five-day deadline before public release, continuing their aggressive
2025-2026 campaign that has targeted ASUS, Chrysler, AT&T, and other
major organizations. This marks Nissan's third significant security
incident in recent years, following the Qilin ransomware attack on its
design subsidiary and the 2023 breach affecting over 100,000
individuals. 

 SPANISH ENERGY COMPANY ENDESA HACKED (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hackers broke into Spanish utility Endesa's commercial systems and
accessed customer data of over 20 million customers, including
identification details, national ID numbers, contract information, and
IBAN payment data. The company says passwords were not exposed,
operations remain normal, and extra security measures and monitoring
are in place. 

 TARGET'S DEV SERVER OFFLINE AFTER HACKERS CLAIM TO STEAL SOURCE CODE
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An unknown threat actor has claimed to have stolen a trove of
Target's internal source code and documentation and is selling it on
dark web marketplaces. After BleepingComputer contacted Target for
comment, the files were taken offline, and Target's Git server became
inaccessible from the internet. Multiple Target employees have
confirmed that the source code samples are legitimate.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OID-SEE: GIVING YOUR OAUTH APPS THE SIDE-EYE (26 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OAuth in Microsoft Entra creates complex webs of apps, permissions,
and identities that are hard to reason about with tables alone, so
modelling everything as a graph reveals abuse paths such as
impersonation and long‑lived access that would otherwise stay
hidden. OID-See uses Microsoft Graph to map service principals,
delegated scopes, app roles, ownership, assignments, and reply URLs
into a graph-backed analysis. It then layers scoring and enrichment to
highlight risky apps, misleading Microsoft-shaped metadata, and
dangerous patterns like broad reachability, wildcard redirects, and
stale credentials. 

 STOPPING KILL SIGNALS AGAINST YOUR EBPF PROGRAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [11]


 When malicious processes gain elevated privileges, they can disable
eBPF agents, weakening a system's security posture. To prevent this,
defenders can hook security_task_kill to prevent kill signals from
reaching the eBPF agent. However, this also blocks any kill signals
sent by defenders, such as to upgrade the agent. Defenders can instead
set the eBPF hook to accept a signed signal with a nonce for restarts.


 EVENTBRIDGE PATTERN MATCHING: A FIELD GUIDE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 EventBridge JSONs can become very complex quickly. AWS provides very
little documentation to help parse them. Fields at the same level of
the JSON are ANDed together, whereas values in an array are ORed
together. If a user wants to apply an OR to two fields, they can use
the $or operator. However, users should be careful when nesting $ors,
as each branch gets expanded into additional sub-patterns that can
become contradictory or complex to debug. This post also covers other
operators and how to combine them to develop complex Boolean logic.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ANTHROPIC LAUNCHES CLAUDE AI FOR HEALTHCARE WITH SECURE HEALTH RECORD
ACCESS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Claude for Healthcare enables Pro and Max subscribers in the US to
connect health records via HealthEx, Function, and upcoming Apple
Health/Android Health Connect integrations for medical history
summarization and test result explanations. The implementation
features privacy-by-design controls allowing users to manage data
sharing permissions, with health data explicitly excluded from model
training. Anthropic's Acceptable Use Policy requires qualified
professional review of outputs for high-risk healthcare decisions,
acknowledging AI limitations in medical contexts. 

 REDTEAM-TOOLS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This GitHub repository contains a collection of 150+ tools and
resources that can be useful for red teaming activities. Some of the
tools may be specifically designed for red teaming, while others are
more general-purpose and can be adapted for use in a red teaming
context.

 GOBRUTEFORCER BOTNET TARGETS CRYPTO PROJECT DATABASES BY EXPLOITING
WEAK CREDENTIALS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Check Point Research identified an upgraded GoBruteforcer campaign
targeting cryptocurrency and blockchain project databases, exploiting
weak credentials spread via AI-generated server-deployment tutorials
and legacy XAMPP stacks that expose FTP and phpMyAdmin interfaces. The
Golang-based botnet features an obfuscated IRC bot, dynamic credential
lists that include crypto-focused usernames, and a module that queries
TRON blockchain addresses for non-zero balances. Separately, GreyNoise
observed 80,469 sessions over 11 days from threat actors
systematically probing 73+ LLM endpoints across major AI providers,
hunting for misconfigured proxy servers that leak API access. 

 DUTCH PORT HACKER SENTENCED TO PRISON (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A Dutch man was sentenced to seven years in prison for hacking port
logistics systems in the Netherlands and Belgium to support cocaine
smuggling operations. He used malware delivered via USB sticks, with
help from an insider, to gain remote access, steal data, and intercept
communications. 

 DUTCH COPS CUFF ALLEGED AVCHECK MALWARE KINGPIN IN AMSTERDAM (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Dutch authorities have arrested a 33-year-old Dutch suspect at
Schiphol Airport, accusing him and two linked companies of running
AVCheck, a major counter-antivirus platform that lets criminals test
and fine-tune malware against multiple security products. AVCheck,
dismantled in May 2025 during Operation Endgame, allegedly helped
attackers perfect campaigns by identifying which targets and defenses
were easiest to evade.
