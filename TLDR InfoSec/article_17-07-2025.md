ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 UNITEDHEALTH-LINKED HEALTH TECH FIRM EPISOURCE BREACH HITS 5.4M
PATIENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Episource, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, suffered a ransomware attack
between January 27 and February 6 that exposed the data of 5.4 million
patients, including medical records, diagnoses, medications, and
insurance info. This is the second major breach for UnitedHealth in 13
months, following the Change Healthcare attack that affected 190
million Americans in February 2024. The attack suggests that threat
actors are now targeting third-party healthcare providers to access
large amounts of protected health information across multiple
organizations. 

 POPULAR FITNESS APP FITIFY EXPOSES 138K USER PROGRESS PHOTOS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fitify, a popular fitness app, exposed 373,000 files, including
138,000 progress photos, via an unsecured Google Cloud storage bucket.
Many of the photos showed users in minimal clothing, making the
exposure highly sensitive. Additionally, private data was accessible
without passwords or security keys, and the app contained hardcoded
secrets that could have allowed attackers to access more user
information. 

 MOBILE NOTARY ZONE SUFFERED A DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Mobile Notary Zone (MNZ), a third-party notary service vendor,
reported a highly sensitive data breach. The compromised data includes
full names and addresses, SSNs, dates of birth, government-issued IDs,
bank account and payment details, loan, employment, and escrow data.
The breach also affected clients served by MNZ, prompting at least one
provider (New American Funding) to terminate its relationship with
them.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO PROTECT YOUR ROUTER FROM BEING HACKED AND BECOMING A
RESIDENTIAL PROXY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hackers target home routers to use as residential proxies,
command-and-control servers, and botnets. Recent ASUS breaches
demonstrate that backdoors can survive updates. These attacks often
brute-force default passwords or exploit vulnerabilities, then install
SSH backdoors. Defenses include disabling WAN management and SSH,
changing default credentials, enabling automatic updates, and auditing
configs for unauthorized access. 

 KONFETY RETURNS: CLASSIC MOBILE THREAT WITH NEW EVASION TECHNIQUES (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Android malware "Konfety" employs sophisticated evasion tactics,
including dual-app deception (same package name for benign and
malicious versions), ZIP-level tampering to break analysis tools,
dynamic code loading with encrypted assets, stealth techniques such as
icon hiding, and the use of the CaramelAds SDK for ad fraud. 

 FROM A TEAMS CALL TO A RANSOMWARE THREAT: MATANBUCHUS 3.0 MAAS LEVELS
UP (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Matanbuchus, a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) loader that has been
active since 2021, has evolved to version 3.0 with enhanced
capabilities. Recent campaigns have used Microsoft Teams impersonation
and Quick Assist for deployment. Updates include improved
communication protocols, in-memory stealth, enhanced obfuscation,
indirect system calls, broader execution support, and enriched data
collection targeting EDR controls.

 THE FIPS 140-3 GO CRYPTOGRAPHIC MODULE (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Go programming language has introduced native FIPS 140-3
compliance support directly into its standard library and `go`
command, starting with Go 1.24. Developers can enable FIPS 140-3 mode
by setting the `fips140=on` GODEBUG option (either as an environment
variable or in go.mod), and can build against validated cryptographic
modules using `GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 go build`. This native integration
eliminates the need for unsupported third-party solutions, providing a
seamless developer experience with cross-compilation support and no
performance overhead from foreign function interfaces. 

 VULNERABLECODE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 VulnerableCode is a free and open database of open source software
package vulnerabilities. 

 SSH-SNAKE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 SSH-Snake is a tool designed to perform automatic network traversal
using SSH private keys discovered on systems with the goal of creating
a comprehensive map of the network and its dependencies.

 DDOS PEAKS HIT NEW HIGHS: CLOUDFLARE MITIGATED MASSIVE 7.3 TBPS
ASSAULT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cloudflare blocked 7.3 million DDoS attacks in Q2 2025, including a
record-breaking 7.3 Tb/s attack. Most attacks were small and brief,
but intense attacks are increasing. Attackers are using increasingly
powerful botnets and targeting new industries and countries. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT A BLIND SPOT BY HIDING MALWARE INSIDE DNS RECORD (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Hackers are concealing malware in DNS records, particularly TXT
records, by converting binary files to hexadecimal and splitting them
across multiple subdomains. This technique evades security defenses as
DNS traffic is often unmonitored and has been used to deliver malware
like Joke Screenmate and malicious PowerShell scripts. 

 SECURITY SHOP ADARMA CEASES TRADING, CONFIRMS IT WILL ENTER
ADMINISTRATION (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 UK cybersecurity firm Adarma has entered administration, the UK
equivalent of bankruptcy, after investor Livingbridge withdrew funding
three months earlier due to major contract losses. All 173 employees
were made redundant with immediate effect on July 14. The company
struggled financially despite charging daily rates of £740-£2,380
and serving clients with a combined turnover of £150 billion.
