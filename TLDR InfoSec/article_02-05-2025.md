 THE HYPE MUST DIE! UNMASKING THE DANGERS OF MISGUIDED AI IN
CYBERSECURITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 When the AI boom began, organizations raced to automate fastest and
implement AI into every workflow.

Now the dust is settling, business leaders are witnessing the ethical,
security, and privacy implications [4] play out - and it's not always
pretty. However, many still feel pressured to adopt AI while
increasingly uncertain about its trustworthiness or governance.

Join WethosAI CEO, Stuart McClure, and CTO, Alen Capalik, for the
final installment in WethosAI's groundbreaking webinar series [4]
about separating AI noise from reality. This session goes deeper than
ever to reveal the cybersecurity realities behind AI's glamorous
façade – and what your organization must know to stay safe and
effective.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 WINDOWS RDP LETS YOU LOG IN USING REVOKED PASSWORDS. MICROSOFT IS OK
WITH THAT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A security researcher discovered a vulnerability where Windows RDP
would accept a revoked password without raising any alerts. This
vulnerability occurs because when a user logs in using a Microsoft or
Azure account, Windows validates the password and then caches it in an
encrypted local storage, which is used for all further authentication
attempts. Microsoft has responded that this is an intentional design
decision to prevent users from getting locked out of a device. 

 ASCENSION DISCLOSES NEW DATA BREACH AFTER THIRD-PARTY HACKING
INCIDENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ascension, one of the largest private healthcare systems in the US,
is notifying patients that their data was stolen in a breach in
December 2024. Ascension stated that the breach was caused by them
inadvertently disclosing data to a business partner which the attacker
then stole the data from via a vulnerability in third-party software
used by the business partner. The disclosed data includes names,
addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race,
gender, and Social Security numbers. 

 EMERA, NOVA SCOTIA POWER RESPOND TO CYBERSECURITY BREACH; INCIDENT
RESPONSE TEAMS MOBILIZED (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Emera Inc. and Nova Scotia Power reported unauthorized access to
their Canadian network. They have isolated the affected systems,
engaged cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement. No
disruption to power operations has occurred.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PWNING THE LADYBIRD BROWSER (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ladybird browser has a bug that allows use-after-free exploitation
via a constructor and a malicious handler. Attackers can manipulate
the argument buffer to trigger a heap-use-after-free condition,
leaking object addresses and potentially achieving code execution by
overwriting return pointers. Exploiting this bug involves crafting
memory structures to control the renderer and executing malicious
code, which requires careful data and pointer manipulation within the
browser environment. 

 MY SIEM-AGNOSTIC CREATIVE PROCESS TO DETECTION ENGINEERING (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post describes a process for understanding a new data source and
creating detections for malicious behaviors. The first steps involve
reading the documentation to understand the service and brainstorming
ideas for what a malicious user might do. Then, examine the logs to
determine what is considered regular or anomalous behavior, often
utilizing event counts. Finally, plan out what type of detection they
will write, write the detection, and then test for success, failure,
and edge cases. 

 VIBE HACKING: FINDING AUTH BYPASS AND RCE IN OPEN GAME PANEL (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Eddie Zhang vibe-hacked his way to discovering vulnerabilities in
Open Game Panel, including a PHP type juggling authentication bypass
and two local file inclusion flaws that enable remote code execution
when chained with game configuration files. His "vibe hacking"
approach combined AI tools with manual analysis, demonstrating both
the potential and limitations of AI-assisted security research.

 HOW US DEFENSE SECRETARY HEGSETH CIRCUMVENTS THE OFFICIAL DOD
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post walks through the various communications equipment that has
been available to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth since the Obama
administration. Hegseth initially would shift his chair to the back of
his office to get a better Wi-Fi signal to use the Signal app but
later requested a direct line to the public internet be run to a
personal computer at his desk with Signal and another app for sending
text messages installed. Hegseth also has access to SecDef Cables,
which is a communications center dedicated to the office of the
Secretary of Defense. 

 TAG YOUR WAY IN: NEW PRIVILEGE ESCALATION TECHNIQUE IN GCP (8 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A new privilege escalation technique in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
exploits IAM Conditions and tagBindings to elevate access for
attackers with low-risk roles. By attaching specific tags to
resources, attackers can bypass restrictions and gain elevated
privileges without directly modifying IAM policies. Organizations
should prioritize securing tag permissions to prevent this overlooked
escalation path in GCP. 

 THE WORDPRESS SECURITY TEAM IS HIDING THAT THEY ARE FAILING TO FIX

issues, lacking transparency and accountability. Despite claims of a
large team, details about their members remain hidden. Some security
issues, like SSRF vulnerability, have gone unaddressed for years
