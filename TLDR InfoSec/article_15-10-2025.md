 OSINT FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION: THE FLASHPOINT GUIDE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Doxxing. Deepfakes. Targeted harassment. Executives are prime targets
[4] for cyber and physical attacks—are you equipped to protect them?

Threats against high-profile individuals often start online—and can
escalate into serious security risks. In The Complete Guide to OSINT
for Executive Protection [4], Flashpoint breaks down how security
teams can:

 	* Identify and neutralize digital threats before they escalate
 	* Set up real-time alerts and remove sensitive data
 	* Use AI-powered analysis, social intelligence, and geospatial data
to track bad actors

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SIMONMED IMAGING: 1.27M INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY JANUARY 2025
CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 In early 2025, a cyberattack at SimonMed Imaging exposed the data of
over 1.27 million patients, including medical and personal
information, with the ransomware group Medusa claiming responsibility.
Medusa likely received a ransom to prevent data release. SimonMed
responded with improved security measures and offered credit
monitoring and identity theft protection to impacted people. 

 SATELLITES FOUND EXPOSING UNENCRYPTED DATA, INCLUDING PHONE CALLS AND
SOME MILITARY COMMS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Sensitive personal, corporate, and military data is being transmitted
unencrypted via about half of Earth's geostationary satellites,
according to researchers. Using a basic satellite receiver, they
accessed voice calls, texts, and critical infrastructure
communications, exposing serious privacy and security risks. 

 PIXEL-STEALING “PIXNAPPING” ATTACK TARGETS ANDROID DEVICES (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 “Pixnapping” is an advanced attack where a malicious Android app
can secretly steal individual pixels from your device's
screen—enabling it to extract sensitive data like 2FA codes, even
from supposedly secure apps. The attack exploits Android's app
messaging system and nearly invisible overlays.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY SIGNAL'S POST-QUANTUM MAKEOVER IS AN AMAZING ENGINEERING
ACHIEVEMENT (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Signal Messenger has rolled out a major upgrade to its encryption
protocol, making it resistant to future quantum computer attacks. This
technical overhaul adds a third layer—a quantum-safe ratchet—to
its already-robust system to ensure strong privacy even if classical
encryption breaks. Thanks to clever use of chunking methods and
erasure codes, Signal's triple ratchet protects users' messaging by
combining classic and quantum-safe security mechanisms, all without
impacting everyday use. 

 WHY UNMONITORED JAVASCRIPT IS YOUR BIGGEST HOLIDAY SECURITY RISK (5
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Client-side JavaScript attacks pose a critical blind spot for
e-commerce security as 73% of sites load 50+ third-party scripts on
checkout pages while only 23% use dedicated client-side monitoring,
allowing attackers to steal payment data through browser-based
skimmers that bypass WAFs and traditional server-side defenses
entirely. Major 2024 attacks, including the Polyfill.io breach
affecting over 500,000 websites and Cisco's Magecart incident,
demonstrate how compromised third-party scripts and supply chain
vulnerabilities enable data theft that often goes undetected for an
average of 7.5 months, with incidents costing $2.4 million plus
regulatory fines. Security teams should immediately implement Content
Security Policy with nonces (avoiding ‘unsafe-inline'), deploy
Subresource Integrity tags for third-party scripts, establish
comprehensive script inventories with regular audits, and deploy
specialized client-side monitoring tools to detect unauthorized data
collection, DOM manipulation, and suspicious script behavior before
the 2025 holiday shopping season. 

 HOW DO TIMING ATTACKS WORK? (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Timing attacks that target string comparison work by measuring how
long it takes a vulnerable server to verify a string, such as a
password or other secret. When a vulnerable function compares two
strings, it loops through each character to check for equality,
causing the function to take slightly longer to complete with each
correct character. The page includes a demo for how this attack works
in practice.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 COMPARING SEMGREP VS. APPSEC ALTERNATIVES (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Independent reviewers confirm that using Semgrep can cut false
positives by over 90% [11] compared to popular alternatives:

 	* With Semgrep, there's no need to manually filter and prioritize
findings because developers only see exploitable, high-priority
issues.
 	* Instead of asking devs to trust a black box, Semgrep offers
explainable findings with rule-level visibility.
 	* Semgrep then delivers AI-assisted, step-by-step fix guidance to
reduce issue resolution time. 

👉 THE BOTTOM LINE? Developers spend 86% less time reviewing
findings [11] and sifting through alert noise. That's 15+ hours saved
every week.

 MALTRAIL (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly
available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally
suspicious trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV
reports and custom user-defined lists. 

 FORENSIC TIMELINER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Forensic Timeliner is a high-speed forensic processing engine built
for DFIR investigations. It can quickly consolidate CSV output from
tools to create a mini timeline, with built in filtering, artifact
detection, keyword tagging, and deduplication. 

 MCP-SNITCH (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 MCP Snitch is a macOS application that intercepts and monitors MCP
server communications, providing security analysis, access control,
and audit logging for AI tool usage.

 HERE'S HOW APPLE IS LOCKING DOWN IPHONES TO COMPLY WITH TEXAS' AGE
VERIFICATION LAW (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Starting next year, Texas will require companies to verify the ages
of people who use their app stores. Apple has announced that beginning
January 1, Texans trying to create a new Apple Account must confirm
their age. If they are under 18, they must join a Family Sharing
group. Parents and guardians will be required to give their consent to
download apps or make in-app purchases, and developers will be
required to implement the Declared Age Range API. 

 DISCORD BLAMED A VENDOR FOR ITS DATA BREACH — NOW THE VENDOR SAYS
IT WAS ‘NOT HACKED' (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Discord reported a breach impacting 70,000 users, claiming a
third-party vendor, 5CA, was responsible, but 5CA denies any hacking
of its systems or handling of government ID photos. The company argues
the incident likely resulted from human error outside its systems, and
both parties are conducting ongoing investigations to clarify further
responsibility and the extent of affected data. 

 ASAHI BREACH LEAVES BITTER TASTE AS BREWER FEARS PERSONAL DATA
SLURPED (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Japanese beer maker Asahi suffered a ransomware attack in late
September that disrupted operations across Japan and may have resulted
in unauthorized access to personal information. The ransomware group
Qilin claims to have stolen 27 GB of data, including employee and
financial records.
