ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MASSIVE SMS STEALER CAMPAIGN INFECTS ANDROID DEVICES IN 113 COUNTRIES
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers are tracking a campaign that utilizes 2,600 Telegram bots
to promote malicious Android APKs controlled by 13 C2 servers. The
bots deliver the malware by either directing victims to fake download
pages that mimic Google Play or by promising to deliver victims a
pirated APK. The malware transmits captured SMS messages to a website
that offers anonymization services by using these phone numbers to
relay OTP codes.

MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Checkmarx researchers have discovered an infostealer campaign
targeting users of the Raydium and Solana blockchains. The campaign
published a set of PyPi packages purporting to be official packages
and then posted high quality responses on StackExchange threads that
promoted the malicious packages. The packages were downloaded over
2,000 times before being removed from PyPi.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHERE TO STORE JWTS (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post breaks down the pros and cons of storing JWT tokens in
cookies vs Session/Local Storage. Neither option is completely secure.
Cookies used with HttpOnly are protected from JavaScript but they are
vulnerable to CSRF and can be used in XSS attacks because the browser
will send them on every request. Session and Local Storage are not
vulnerable to CSRF but are designed to be accessed from JavaScript and
are also vulnerable to XSS. Session Storage is per-tab, so users that
open a link in a new tab will be logged out in that tab. 

 AN OPINIONATED RAMP UP GUIDE TO AWS PENTESTING (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article begins with discussing some dark patterns in cloud
pentesting before offering a 7 stage roadmap to ramp up in AWS
pentesting. The first couple of stages begin with solving Red Team
labs with official and community walkthroughs before beginning to do
CTFs independently. The next couple of stages involve automating
exploits for CTFs and learning to build a secure AWS environment with
CloudSLAW. The final stages focus on filling in knowledge gaps,
synthesizing knowledge, and continuous learning. 

 APPSEC GUIDES, NOT GATES: INTRODUCING SECURE GUARDRAILS WITH SEMGREP
(5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Use secure guardrails instead of traditional ‚Äúshift-left‚Äù gates.
Secure guardrails integrate directly into developer workflow, should
offer autofixes or advice that aligns with organization policies, and
should empower developers to write more secure code and use
secure-by-default libraries while also allowing developers to adjust
or override guardrails when needed. Semgrep can be used to implement
secure guardrails and provides a scorecard to grade your
implementation of secure guardrails.
