ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ENGINEERING GIANT SMITHS GROUP DISCLOSES SECURITY BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 British engineering giant Smiths Group has disclosed that it detected
unauthorized activity in its network. Smiths reported that it isolated
the affected systems as soon as the unauthorized activity was
detected. Smiths has not disclosed if any customer data was accessed
at this time. 

 ENGLOBAL SAYS HACKERS ACCESSED SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA DURING
CYBERATTACK (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 US engineering firm ENGlobal reported that hackers accessed sensitive
personal information during an attack in November 2024. ENGlobal did
not disclose details of what data was accessed. The filing also
implied that the attack may have involved ransomware and that some
systems were offline for six weeks. 

 ADVERSARIAL MISUSE OF GENERATIVE AI (27 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This blog post from Google Threat Intelligence Group explores how
state-sponsored threat actors attempted to misuse Google's AI
assistant Gemini. The research found that while threat actors from
countries like Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia used Gemini for
tasks like research, coding, and content generation, with Iranian
actors being the heaviest users, they have not developed novel
capabilities or successfully bypassed security controls. The report
concludes that while AI can be a useful tool for threat actors, it has
not yet proven to be the game-changer some feared, though Google
emphasizes continued vigilance through robust security measures and
responsible AI development practices.

contain breaches. This post dives into how companies can deal with
these threats. 

 STATIC SOURCE CODE SECURITY SCANNING TOOLS EVALUATION BENCHMARK (11
MINUTE READ) [9]

testing (SAST) tools. It provides objective criteria for organizations
to select appropriate tools, focusing exclusively on static code
analysis while excluding dynamic testing methods and non-code scanning
tools. 

 ONE STEP AHEAD IN CYBER HIDE-AND-SEEK: AUTOMATING MALICIOUS
INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY WITH GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Palo Alto's Unit 42 has observed that threat actors often reuse
infrastructure. Using a Graph Neural Network, Unit 42 has demonstrated
that it can discover new malicious infrastructure before it is
weaponized. The post walks through three case studies where the team
was able to apply this technique.
