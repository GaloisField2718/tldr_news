 FLASHPOINT REPORT: 5 RANSOMWARE GROUPS BEHIND NEARLY 2900 ATTACKS IN
2024 (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Infostealers infected 23M+ devices in 2024, harvesting 2.1B stolen
credentials. That's just one insight from Flashpoint's data-rich 2025
Global Threat Intelligence Report. [4]

The report delivers expert-curated intelligence on adversary
playbooks, including the TTPs of the five major
ransomware-as-a-service groups responsible for nearly half of all
attacks. On the solution side, it reveals how security teams can cut
critical vulnerability patching workloads by 83% [4] by focusing on
exploitability rather than severity scores.

security resilience and mitigate emerging threats before they

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BROADCOM EMPLOYEE DATA STOLEN BY RANSOMWARE CROOKS FOLLOWING HIT ON
PAYROLL PROVIDER (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A September 2024 ransomware attack on Business Systems House (BSH),
ADP's Middle Eastern partner, resulted in the theft of Broadcom
employee data. El Dorado/BlackLock claimed responsibility. Stolen data
potentially included personal information, financial details, and
employment records. ADP confirmed that only a small subset of clients
in the Middle East countries were affected. 

 PRODUCTION AT STEELMAKER NUCOR DISRUPTED BY CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 North American steel giant Nucor halted some production after hackers
accessed its computer systems. The company is working with experts and
police while restarting operations. No one has claimed responsibility
for the attack, and the financial impact is still unknown. 

 HARD-CODED API KEY IN AI NOTE TAKING APP EXPOSED USERS' PRIVATE
TRANSCRIPTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A security researcher from Tenable discovered that a new release of
its Mac desktop client included an AssemblyAI API key. This API key
could be retrieved from the Electron app to enumerate and download any
user's private meeting transcript. The researcher notified Granite,
whose CEO responded by removing the offending API key and notifying
the researcher that the vulnerability had only affected a smaller
group of TestFlight users.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT DOES EU'S BUG DATABASE MEAN FOR VULNERABILITY TRACKING? (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The European Union's cyber agency ENISA launched the European
Vulnerability Database (EUVD), a new vulnerability tracking system
with a numbering format that includes CVE references. Experts debate
whether this additional database will help create redundancy or
further fragment the vulnerability tracking landscape. 

 CYBERSECURITY (ANTI)PATTERNS: BUSYWORK GENERATORS (15 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Busywork generators are solutions that create a disproportionate
amount of busywork compared to the security value they add. They can
be introduced due to not fully understanding the root cause of a
security issue, prioritizing the wrong solution, and lacking
organization-wide mechanisms to enforce the solution. Security teams
can avoid busywork generators by introducing security guardrails and
adopting a reasonable threshold of acceptable alerts. 

 ANALYZING CVE-2025-31191: A MACOS SECURITY-SCOPED BOOKMARKS SANDBOX
ESCAPE (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Microsoft discovered a vulnerability in macOS that allowed
applications to escape the App Sandbox without user interaction while
researching macro exploit detection for Microsoft Office in April
2024. Security-scoped bookmarks are a macOS mechanism that bypasses
the App Sandbox using explicit, persistent user choices. Microsoft
researchers discovered that the Keychain entry used for
security-scoped bookmarks can be overwritten to sign new bookmarks.
