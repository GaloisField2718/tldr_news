 GETTING TO KNOW THE NIST AI RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Excitement around AI is at an all time high - and compliance is
starting to catch up.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently
released its AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4], which aims to
help organizations manage the new and evolving territory of AI risk
[4] ‚Äî including potential harms to people, organizations, and
ecosystems.

This handy guide by Hyperproof [4] offers a detailed overview of AI
risk, an explanation of the different risk categories delineated in
the NIST AI RMF, and a summary of the key concepts it introduces. Read
the full, ungated guide here [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PHYSICAL SECURITY BIZ EXPOSES 1.2M FILES VIA UNPROTECTED DATABASE (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Amberstone Security exposed nearly 1.3 million documents through a
misconfigured public-facing database. The leaked data, dating back to
2017, contained over 99,000 snapshots of guards checking in for
shifts. The data includes sensitive information like names, headshots,
ID cards, and signatures, potentially compromising the security of the
company's operations and personnel. 

 XIAOMI ANDROID DEVICES HIT BY MULTIPLE FLAWS ACROSS APPS AND SYSTEM
COMPONENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [6]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY YOUR VPN MAY NOT BE AS SECURE AS IT CLAIMS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VPNs may not provide complete protection against snooping when
connecting from untrusted networks. Attackers on the same network can
abuse the DHCP protocol to force a target's traffic off the VPN tunnel
without triggering alerts. By running a rogue DHCP server and
manipulating gateway settings, attackers can snoop on the target's
traffic while passing it through to the legitimate gateway, bypassing
the VPN's encryption. 

 DOCKER IMAGELESS REPOSITORIES USED TO PUNT MALWARE AND PHISHING
SCHEMES (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 JFrog identified that nearly 20% of repositories on DockerHub were
imageless repositories that were involved in three campaigns to social
engineer users to download malware or expose credit card information.
The attacks would include links in the description of imageless
repositories on DockerHub to redirect users to malicious pages. JFrog
worked with DockerHub to remove the repositories and remove the
capability to include links in imageless repositories' descriptions. 

 HOW NOT TO PROTECT YOUR ANDROID APPLICATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article advises against common security methods for Android
apps, like relying on signing certificates and trusting the framework
API, as they can be bypassed or manipulated by attackers. It also
highlights the vulnerability of binary files in Android security,
emphasizing the risk of hook attacks on dynamically linked binaries.
The article suggests considering the potential benefits of cracked
versions of apps as an alternative distribution channel with
cost-effective advantages.

 POLICE RESURRECT LOCKBIT'S SITE AND TROLL THE RANSOMWARE GANG (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Law enforcement agencies have resurrected the seized darkweb site of
the infamous LockBit ransomware gang, teasing new revelations about
the group. The revived site features posts with titles suggesting that
authorities plan to release information about LockBit members and
their activities within the next 24 hours in an apparent move to troll
and warn the hackers after successfully infiltrating their operations
earlier this year. 

 SSO TAX, CUT (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This blog post discusses why Tailscale originally charged extra for
advanced identity providers and why it decided to remove this charge.
Tailscale requires SSO and doesn't allow for username + password
authentication, but made the decision to charge extra for some
paid/advanced identity providers, believing that clients of those IdPs
might want premium features anyway. However, when Tailscale
reevaluated its pricing structure, it realized that this created an
SSO tax and customer feedback indicated that it didn't really impact
their chosen services. 

 PDD IS A DYING FRAUDULENT COMPANY AND TEMU IS CLEVERLY HIDDEN SPYWARE
(20 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 An internal and external investigation into PDD and its shopping app
TEMU concluded that the app is spyware and is likely selling or
looking to sell user data. Grizzly Research conducted its own
decompilation of the TEMU app and corroborated with third-party
researchers that the app is harvesting user data in malicious and
hidden ways. The company's corporate financials and infrastructure are
also suspect.
