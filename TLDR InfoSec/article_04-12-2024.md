ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 UGANDA CONFIRMS HACK OF CENTRAL BANK ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Bank of Uganda announced that offshore hackers stole nearly 17M
USD from accounts in the country's central bank. Uganda's largest
independent newspaper reported that the hack may have involved
collusion from malicious insiders. Conversely, a state-owned newspaper
published that over half of the stolen currency had been recovered and
downplayed the attack. 

 VULNERABILITIES EXPOSE MYSCADA MYPRO SYSTEMS TO REMOTE HACKING (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cybersecurity researcher Michael Heinzl discovered 4 critical and 1
high vulnerability in mySCADA's myPRO system. The vulnerabilities in
the ICS software include OS command injection, improper and missing
authentication, and path traversal. CISA which coordinated the
disclosure has not observed any evidence of exploitation. 

 TELCOS STRUGGLE TO BOOT CHINESE HACKERS FROM NETWORKS (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 FBI and CISA have noted that the China-linked hacking group Salt
Typhoon still has access to U.S. telecommunications networks, causing
concerns for officials. Steps are being taken to strengthen network
security against these hackers. Efforts are ongoing to remove the
hackers completely, with some progress being made by companies working
with the government.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TAILSCALE'S INFRA TEAM STAYS SMALL (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tailscale's infrastructure team is composed of only three engineers.
The company is able to simplify networking infrastructure by utilizing
Tailnets to connect resources across VPCs and different cloud
providers while handling access at the Tailscale ACL level. Tailscale
ACLs combined with setec, an in-house secrets manager to simplify
secrets management as well. 

 WHY PHISHERS LOVE NEW TLDS LIKE .SHOP, .TOP, AND .XYZ (4 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Phishing attacks have increased by nearly 40 percent, with many
targeting new domain extensions like .shop and .xyz due to their low
prices and minimal registration requirements. These new gTLDs
accounted for 37 percent of cybercrime domains reported in the past
year. Despite this trend, ICANN plans to introduce more new gTLDs in
the future, raising concerns about further opportunities for
cybercriminals. 

 STOP USING PREDICTABLE BUCKET NAMES: A FAILED ATTEMPT AT HACKING
SATELLITES (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Jonathan Walker of Security Runners crawled through AWS documentation
to create a list of all possible service buckets and determine if any
were available for bucket namesquatting. During his research, Walker
discovered buckets created for a large number of regions that didn't
yet exist such as us-east-3. While ultimately unsuccessful at
discovering an available bucket for namesquatting, Walker's discovery
that AWS reserves buckets in a large list of uncreated regions to
protect against attacks like this is interesting.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REQUESTSHIELD (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 RequestShield is an open source tool written in Python designed to
analyze HTTP access.log files and identify suspicious HTTP requests
and potential security threats. It uses factors like geolocation,
abuse history, request volume, and suspicious request paths to assign
a risk score to each IP, providing actionable insights for security
monitoring. RequestShield helps security teams detect and mitigate
threats by analyzing access logs in real-time. 

 SEMGR8S (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Semgr8s is an admissions controller for Kubernetes that uses Semgrep
rules to validate k8s resources before deployment. 

 NATIVEBYPASSCREDGUARD (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 NativeBypassCredGuard is a Red Team tool that bypasses Credential
Guard by patching WDigest.dll using NTAPI functions. It can force
plaintext credential storage in memory, making user credentials easily
retrievable. The tool offers options to check current values or write
new values, with the ability to remap the ntdll library for bypassing
security mechanisms.

 APT35 FORGES RECRUITMENT SITES, LAUNCHES ATTACKS ON AEROSPACE AND
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRIES IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 APT35, a threat group linked to Iran, is targeting aerospace and
semiconductor industries in various countries using forged recruitment
sites to lure victims into downloading malicious programs. The
attackers utilize legitimate internet resources like OneDrive and
Google Cloud to carry out their activities, making threat detection
and protection tools essential for defense against these attacks.
ThreatBook has identified key indicators of compromise (IOCs) related
to this attack event to enhance threat intelligence detection and
protection efforts.
