ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CORNERSTONE STAFFING RANSOMWARE ATTACK LEAKS 120,000 RESUMES, CLAIMS
QILIN GANG (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Qilin ransomware group breached Cornerstone Staffing Solutions,
exfiltrating 300GB, including 120,000 resumes, SSNs, employee salary
data, and internal financial records. The Russian-linked group has
become 2025's most active ransomware operation with 991 victims since
2023, employing double extortion tactics and recently allying with
LockBit and DragonForce. Security teams should expect increased
targeting of staffing agencies and organizations storing large volumes
of PII. Threat actors are leveraging the stolen resumes for
sophisticated phishing campaigns. 

 LOGITECH CONFIRMS DATA BREACH FOLLOWING DESIGNATION AS ORACLE HACK
VICTIM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Logitech has acknowledged a data breach after being listed by Cl0p
ransomware, but did not confirm a connection to Oracle. The attack
likely exploited a zero-day vulnerability in third-party software,
allowing some employee, consumer, customer, and supplier information
to have been copied. No sensitive data, such as IDs or credit cards,
appears to have been affected. 

 EUROFIBER ADMITS CROOKS SWIPED DATA FROM FRENCH UNIT AFTER
CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Eurofiber's French branch suffered a cyberattack on November 13 that
exposed company data through a vulnerability in its ticket platform.
Eurofiber claims that no banking data was exfiltrated, and the flaw
has now been resolved. However, the attackers sought extortion for an
unspecified amount of data. The company is working with authorities
and clients to determine the incident.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USING AWS SECRETS MANAGER AGENT WITH AMAZON EKS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS Secrets Manager Agent simplifies the retrieval of secrets in EKS
clusters. The Secrets Manager Agent is a client-side agent that
retrieves and caches secrets in your compute environment, allowing
applications to consume secrets directly through an in-memory cache
via a local HTTP endpoint. The agent implements pod identity to
provide authentication and access control. 

 BYPASSING WIFI CLIENT ISOLATION (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Client isolation is a security feature that prevents devices
connected to the same network from communicating directly with each
other. A device can spoof WiFi frames with the From-DS to bypass the
Access Point (AP) and make a client think the communication is coming
from the distribution system instead of directly from a client. In an
encrypted network, the attacker will also need to spoof the WPA 4-way
handshake or use a tool like aircrack-ng to deauthenticate a victim
device.

 RESEARCHERS QUESTION ANTHROPIC CLAIM THAT AI-ASSISTED ATTACK WAS 90%
AUTONOMOUS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Anthropic reported a major AI-driven cyber espionage attempt using
Claude AI, claiming it automated 90% of hacking steps for suspected
Chinese attackers. However, outside experts challenge this view,
saying such full automation is exaggerated, as most attacks were not
successful, and the AI often fabricated results. 

 GOOGLE ONLINE SECURITY BLOG: RUST IN ANDROID: MOVE FAST AND FIX
THINGS (7 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Google's use of Rust in Android has led to a 1,000x reduction in
memory safety vulnerabilities compared to C/C++, while also
accelerating software delivery. Rust's adoption means fewer code
reviews, reworks, and rollbacks, making it now integral to Android's
kernel, firmware, and apps, delivering greater safety and efficiency,
even as rare bugs are quickly fixed without undermining overall
security benefits. 

 FIVE PLEAD GUILTY TO HELPING NORTH KOREANS INFILTRATE US FIRMS (3
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Five individuals pleaded guilty to facilitating North Korean IT
worker infiltration schemes that compromised 136 US companies and
generated over $2.2 million for the DPRK regime through stolen and
false identities. The operation involved identity theft from 18 US
persons, salary funneling to North Korea, and data exfiltration.
Meanwhile, the DOJ separately moved to seize $15 million in
cryptocurrency stolen by APT38/Lazarus from four 2023 exchange heists
totaling $382 million. Organizations should strengthen identity
verification for remote workers, implement behavioral analytics to
detect credential sharing or anomalous access patterns, and monitor
for data exfiltration to foreign adversary infrastructure.
