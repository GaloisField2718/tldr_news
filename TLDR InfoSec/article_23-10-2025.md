 STRONGDM DEBUTS IN GARTNER'S MAGIC QUADRANT FOR PRIVILEGED ACCESS
MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most PAM vendors started with password vaults and bolted on cloud
connectors. StrongDM was built differently [4]: a universal access
platform that treats authorization, not authentication, as the primary
control plane.

Instead of managing static secrets, StrongDM enforces continuous,
policy-based authorization for every access request [4]. It works
across databases, Kubernetes clusters, cloud consoles, CI/CD systems,
and APIs - evaluating user identity, role, device health, and context
in real time.

The result is temporary, least-privilege access without
pre-provisioned admin accounts or long-lived credentials - and
granular auditing that shows not just who accessed what, but what they
did while there.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RESEARCHERS UNCOVER REMOTE CODE EXECUTION FLAW IN ABANDONED RUST CODE
LIBRARY (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CVE-2025-62518 is a high-severity boundary-parsing vulnerability
(CVSS 8.1) in the abandoned async-tar Rust library that allows remote
code execution through file overwriting. The flaw affects critical
tools, including the uv package manager, tokio-tar (5+ million
downloads), and multiple widely-used forks. The issue highlights the
open-source abandonware crisis, where unmaintained code is repeatedly
forked, spreading bugs across ecosystems with limited visibility and
patchability. Security teams should audit dependencies for async-tar
and related forks (tokio-tar, testcontainers, wasmCloud), apply
available patches, and establish processes to track abandoned
dependencies. 

 TP-LINK WARNS OF CRITICAL COMMAND INJECTION FLAW IN OMADA GATEWAYS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 TP-Link has issued a warning about two command injection
vulnerabilities in Omada gateway devices that could allow attackers to
execute arbitrary OS commands. One of the flaws has a critical
severity rating (CVSS 9.3) and can be exploited by unauthenticated
attackers, while the second requires access to the web management
interface. TP-Link also disclosed two additional vulnerabilities in a
separate bulletin that could allow command injection and root access. 

 TYKIT SVG PHISHING KIT TIED TO ATTACKS TARGETING M365 CREDENTIALS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from ANY.RUN identified a new phishing campaign using SVG
attachments as lures, dubbed the Typical phishing kit or Tykit. The
malicious SVG distracts users while embedded JavaScript redirects the
victim to a “trampoline” page,  which then leads to a phishing
site mimicking the Microsoft 365 login page. ANY.RUN believes this
campaign is operated by a Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) operator.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PROMPT INJECTION TO RCE IN AI AGENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trail of Bits discovered argument injection vulnerabilities across
three popular AI agent platforms that allow attackers to bypass human
approval safeguards and achieve remote code execution. The flaw
exploits pre-approved “safe commands” such as git, find, and
ripgrep through malicious flag combinations (e.g., git show --format
to write files, fd -x=python3 for execution, or go test -exec to run
arbitrary code). These one-shot prompt-injections can be embedded in
code comments, GitHub repositories, or logs. Researchers note that
maintaining allowlists of “safe commands” without sandboxing is
fundamentally insecure, as flag filtering is impractical. Security
teams should use container-based sandboxing, use argument separators
(--), drastically reduce allowlists, and audit against
GTFOBINS/LOLBINS for potential abuse. 

 UNLOCKING FREE WIFI ON BRITISH AIRWAYS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 British Airways offers free “messaging” WiFi to frequent flyer
members, limited to whitelisted messaging app domains via SNI (Server
Name Indication) filtering in TLS handshakes. By simulating traffic to
approved domains, researchers found they could tunnel general web
activity through the free tier. The method relies on customizing TLS
connections and proxying traffic, demonstrating how SNI leaks
destination domains even when content is encrypted and how service
restrictions can be bypassed with technical knowledge. 

 VERIZON: MOBILE BLINDSPOT LEADS TO NEEDLESS DATA BREACHES (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Many organizations overlook mobile security, leaving them exposed as
employees transmit attacks from personal devices. Smishing has become
more effective than email phishing, with up to half of users failing
simulated tests. Despite the availability of strong mobile defenses,
most organizations fail to adopt them, leading to increased breach
risk, downtime, and regulatory consequences.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CONTAIN SLACK DATA BEFORE IT COSTS MILLIONS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Uncontrolled data equals uncontrolled risk. BENlabs deployed Onna to
protect against litigation costs and infosec vulnerabilities hiding in
Slack. The result: proactive discovery, predictable costs, and
stronger compliance. Onna gives teams the confidence to scale without
fear of legal or security fallout.

 Imhex is a modern, high-performance hex editor for reverse engineers
and programmers. It features a visually optimized interface, data
pattern analysis, and powerful scripting capabilities. 

 GRAVWELL (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Gravwell is an enterprise analytics and security platform that helps
teams centralize logs, accelerate threat hunting, and analyze data
from both IT and OT environments. 

 INTRODUCING HONEYBEE: HOW WE AUTOMATE HONEYPOT DEPLOYMENT FOR THREAT
RESEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Wiz has open-sourced HoneyBee, an automation framework that rapidly
deploys realistic honeypots by generating intentionally misconfigured
Dockerfiles and Docker Compose manifests for popular cloud apps. Each
honeypot can include AI-generated misconfigurations, Nuclei validation
templates, and optional tcpdump monitoring. Using HoneyBee, Wiz
researchers discovered cryptomining campaigns targeting exposed Java
Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) and PostgreSQL, capturing complete attack
chains, from XMRig deployment to fileless persistence within hours.
Honeybee supports three key use cases: validating detection rules
safely, orchestrating honeypot networks with SIEM/CSPM integration,
and creating hands-on training environments that mirror real-world
misconfigurations

 CHINESE GANGS MADE OVER $1B TARGETING AMERICANS WITH SCAM TEXTS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Chinese organized crime groups have generated over $1 billion in just
three years through a large-scale SMS scam operation targeting
Americans with fake toll, postage, and government refund messages. The
campaign has surged 350% since January 2024, with a record 330,000
scam texts reported in a single day. The operation uses US-based SIM
farms to send messages, steals credit card data, and bypasses MFA by
adding stolen cards to mobile wallets (which banks often trust after
first use). The groups also employ 400-500 gig workers and money mules
recruited via Telegram to buy and resell high-value goods and gift
cards for laundering. Security teams should educate users to avoid
unsolicited payment messages, verify messages through official
channels, tighten device trust policies for mobile wallets, monitor
gift card purchases, and deploy anti-malware solutions with web
protection and scam detection capabilities. 

 STATE OF CLOUD SECURITY (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Datadog's 2025 State of Cloud Security report shows progress
alongside persistent gaps across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. IMDSv2
enforcement has increased to 49% of EC2 instances, and federated
authentication adoption now covers 79% of organizations. However, 59%
of AWS IAM users still have access keys older than one year, and
nearly one in five EC2 instances remain overprivileged. While data
perimeter adoption and public access blocking have improved, insecure
defaults and lingering legacy practices continue to expose
organizations to risk. 

 JAGUAR LAND ROVER LOOKING AT $2.5B PRICE TAG FROM CRIPPLING
CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Jaguar Land Rover suffered one of the most expensive cyberattacks in
UK history, disrupting production for weeks and affecting over 5,000
organizations. The attack is estimated to have cost at least £1.9
billion in damages and triggered significant supply chain and
operational fallout. Government agencies intervened to assist in
recovery, but full restoration of systems remains ongoing.
