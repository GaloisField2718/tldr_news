 A MODERN APPROACH TO VENDOR RISK MANAGEMENT WITH CONTINUOUS
MONITORING + AI (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The typical vendor risk review is a series of questionnaires sent
back and forth between buyers and vendors, and does little to actually
improve security. Generic Trust Centers are not much better.

Auditive is the better way. [4]

🧠 AI instantly parses vendor documents and public data against your
specific requirements.

⚠️ Use the Auditive risk network [4] to review vendor risk ahead
of time, then only contact vendors for remaining questions.

🔔 Get updates whenever your vendors' risk posture changes.
