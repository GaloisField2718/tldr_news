 AI GOAT: AN OPEN SOURCE ENVIRONMENT THAT PITS YOU AGAINST THE OWASP
TOP 10 ML RISKS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Orca's AI Goat, provided as a free and open source tool [4], is an
intentionally vulnerable AI environment for testing and learning
purposes. The ready-to-deploy Terraform environment [4] launches an
online application riddled with threats and vulnerabilities, based on
the OWASP top 10 ML risks.

Using AI Goat, security professionals and pentesters can better
understand AI-specific vulnerabilities [4], how they can be exploited,
and how to best defend against them.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MICROSOFT PATCHES CRITICAL COPILOT STUDIO VULNERABILITY EXPOSING
SENSITIVE DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical security flaw (CVE-2024-38206) in Microsoft's Copilot
Studio could allow authenticated attackers to bypass SSRF protection
and access sensitive information. The vulnerability exploits Copilot's
external web request feature to access Microsoft's internal
infrastructure. 

 HALLIBURTON SHUTS DOWN SYSTEMS AFTER CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Energy giant Halliburton has reported a cyberattack, prompting it to
shut down some internal systems. The company is investigating the
impact. The U.S. Department of Energy has reported no current

 SLACK AI CAN BE TRICKED INTO LEAKING DATA FROM PRIVATE CHANNELS VIA
PROMPT INJECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A method to abuse Slack AI to leak messages from private channels was
recently discovered. The prompt injection attack enables attackers to

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT IS AN SBAT AND WHY DOES EVERYONE SUDDENLY CARE (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) was developed to address the
limitations of revoking individual hashes for bootloader binaries in
the Secure Boot ecosystem. Microsoft pushed a Windows update that made
systems not trust versions of grub with a security generation below a
certain level due to security vulnerabilities, causing boot issues for
some users. The incident highlights the importance of updating
bootloader code and security generations to prevent potential attacks
on operating systems.

modifications, and reverse shells, providing practical demonstrations
using a tool called PANIX. The post aims to educate defenders and
researchers on foundational aspects of Linux persistence for effective
detection and security strategies.

 SECURITY TRAINING & AWARENESS - 10 ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES (16 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 This post reflects on what aspects have helped security awareness
training work and what hasn't. It emphasizes ambient security controls
which offer concrete solutions and escalation paths over long lists of
policies and traditional, computer-based training. It also points out
key moments to reinforce learning, such as when users run into a guard
rail and when they switch positions. 

 16 THOUGHTS ON ‚ÄúLOCAL NETWORKS GO GLOBAL WHEN DOMAIN NAMES
COLLIDE‚Äù (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Due to the proliferation of new Top Level Domains (TLDs), many
internal networks now collide with external networks, potentially
exposing their networks to credential theft and other attacks.
Security researcher Philippe Caturegli has been mapping this
"namespace collision" vulnerability by scanning for self-signed
certificates referencing domains in business-oriented TLDs. Caturegli
found over 9,000 exposed domains, with some government entities and
critical infrastructure affected.
