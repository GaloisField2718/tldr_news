ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OPENSSL ISSUED SECURITY UPDATES TO FIX 12 FLAWS, INCLUDING REMOTE
CODE EXECUTION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 OpenSSL patched 12 vulnerabilities in its widely used cryptographic
library, most of which involve memory safety and parsing weaknesses
that can cause denial-of-service or data-integrity issues. Two
critical stack-overflow bugs in CMS/PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 parsing can
potentially enable remote code execution when handling untrusted data,
making timely updates essential for organizations relying on OpenSSL
3.x. 

 FORTINET CONFIRMS NEW ZERO-DAY BEHIND MALICIOUS SSO LOGINS (4 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 CVE-2026-24858 is a critical authentication-bypass vulnerability
(CVSS 9.8) that affects FortiOS, FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer,
FortiProxy, and FortiWeb. It allows attackers to log in to devices via
FortiCloud SSO. The zero-day, added to CISA's KEV catalog, emerged
after reports that the December CVE-2025-59718 patch was being
bypassed, prompting Fortinet to temporarily disable FortiCloud SSO
globally on January 26. Organizations should immediately upgrade
affected products. FortiCloud SSO now blocks login attempts from
vulnerable device versions. 

 MATCH GROUP BREACH EXPOSES DATA FROM HINGE, TINDER, OKCUPID, AND
MATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Match Group has confirmed that a “limited amount of user data”
was stolen after ShinyHunters claimed a breach of 1.7GB of stolen
files allegedly containing 10M records. The attackers stole data after
compromising an Okta SSO account, which gave them access to the
company's AppsFlyer marketing analytics platform and to Google Drive
and Dropbox accounts. The hackers stated that while the data contains
some PII, it's mostly tracking data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CORRUPTING THE HIVE MIND: PERSISTENCE THROUGH FORGOTTEN WINDOWS
INTERNALS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Swarmer is a low‑privilege tool that quietly edits Windows user
registry hives without triggering common EDR hooks on standard
registry APIs. Swarmer builds offline registry hives with Offreg.dll
by abusing legacy mandatory user profiles and the NTUSER.MAN
mechanism, enabling per‑user persistence that survives reboots while
largely evading traditional monitoring. This post walks through the
workflow, implementation quirks, operational caveats, and both
defensive detection opportunities and attacker takeaways around this
forgotten Windows feature set. 

 HOW REP+ HELPED ME IDENTIFY A CRITICAL SUPABASE JWT EXPOSURE (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher discovered a critical Supabase misconfiguration
in which an anonymous JWT embedded in client-side JavaScript granted
read access to password_reset_tokens and 34 other tables due to
missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The exposure of 272
password reset tokens and plaintext passwords enabled a full account
takeover, demonstrating how publicly intended anonymous keys become
dangerous when RLS is improperly configured. Security teams should
audit Supabase deployments by enumerating REST endpoints with anon
tokens and validating RLS enforcement across all exposed tables. 

 BUILDING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AGILITY INTO SIGSTORE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Trail of Bits collaborated with the Sigstore community to implement
controlled cryptographic flexibility through predefined algorithm
suites, avoiding the in-band signaling vulnerabilities that plagued
systems like JWT while enabling organizations to select signing
algorithms beyond the original hard-coded ECDSA P-256. The
implementation includes a centralized algorithm registry in Protobuf
specifications, configurable algorithm restrictions via
--client-signing-algorithms flags in Rekor and Fulcio, and a new
--signing-algorithm option in Cosign for ephemeral key generation. Go
implementations of post-quantum algorithms, LMS, and ML-DSA were
developed to validate that the architecture can accommodate future
cryptographic standards.

 US SENTENCES CHINESE NATIONAL FOR ROLE IN $36.9 MILLION CRYPTO SCAM
(2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Jingliang Su, a Chinese national, was sentenced to 46 months in
prison for his role in a Cambodia-based cryptocurrency investment scam
that defrauded 174 Americans of $36.9 million through fake trading
platforms and romance-based social engineering. The operation
laundered stolen funds through US shell companies and offshore
accounts before converting them to Tether cryptocurrency via Deltec
Bank in the Bahamas. Su is one of nine defendants who pleaded guilty,
and he was ordered to pay $26.8 million in restitution. 

 WHY THE MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY WORKS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The MITRE ATT&CK framework can help SOC teams understand behaviors as
opposed to isolated data points from alerts. SOC teams can also
utilize SIEM tools that map detection rules to ATT&CK tactics to
understand their detection coverage. This enables SOC teams to shift
from chasing alerts to observing narratives. 

 FINTECH FIRM MARQUIS BLAMES HACK AT FIREWALL PROVIDER SONICWALL FOR
ITS DATA BREACH (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Fintech data broker Marquis has pinned a major 2025 ransomware breach
on firewall supplier SonicWall, claiming a SonicWall cloud backup hack
exposed its firewall configurations and credentials. Hackers allegedly
used this data to bypass defenses and steal sensitive US banking
customer information, including Social Security numbers. Marquis is
weighing legal and financial recoupment options, while SonicWall
publicly disputes any proven link to broader ransomware campaigns.
