 You know the drill: attackers only need to win once, you need to win
every single time. The game is rigged against you.

ThreatLocker Application Allowlisting [4] lets you play by different

everything, only approved applications run [4]. Everything else is
BLOCKED BY DEFAULT.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BROSIX AND CHATOX PROMISED TO KEEP YOUR CHATS SECURED. THEY DIDN'T (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Chatox and Brosix are both communications platforms for personal and
team use owned by Stefan Chekanov. A security researcher discovered an
unencrypted backup of chat logs containing 155.3GB of unique,
compressed files containing over 65M stored messages and 73K files for
Chatox and over 37M messages and 191K files for Brosix. Upon
notification, the Brosix backup was secured, but the Chatox backup is
still unsecured. 

 WINRAR ZERO-DAY EXPLOITED TO PLANT MALWARE ON ARCHIVE EXTRACTION (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers from ESET discovered a new WinRAR vulnerability that is
being actively exploited in phishing campaigns. Unpatched versions of
WinRAR and Windows versions of UnRAR, RAR, and UnRAR.dll can be
tricked into using a path specified by a maliciously crafted archive
file as the extraction directory. This vulnerability is being
exploited by the Russian hacking group RomCom to install malware. 

 LINUX-BASED LENOVO WEBCAMS' FLAW CAN BE REMOTELY EXPLOITED FOR BADUSB
ATTACKS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Security researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Lenovo 510 FHD and
Performance FHD webcams that allow attackers to remotely transform
them into BadUSB devices capable of injecting keystrokes and
installing malware. The Linux-based webcams lack firmware validation,
enabling complete compromise and persistent re-infection even after
system wipes and OS reinstalls. Lenovo has released firmware version
4.8.0 to address the vulnerabilities following responsible disclosure
in April.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REPEATER STRIKE: MANUAL TESTING, AMPLIFIED (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Gareth Heyes of PortSwigger writes about his experience writing a
Burp Suite AI extension to automate hunting for IDOR and similar
vulnerabilities. The extension, Repeater Strike, scans requests and
responses to generate regular expressions that can be used to identify
vulnerabilities in your traffic. While the extension worked in small
tests, the AI struggled with longer responses, creating regular
expressions that aren't site specific, and detecting more complex
vulnerabilities. 

 I SPY: ESCALATING TO ENTRA ID'S GLOBAL ADMIN WITH A FIRST-PARTY APP
(10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers from DataDog discovered an attack vector where an
attacker could abuse an Entra ID service principal (SP) with the Cloud
Application Administrator or Application Administrator roles or the
`Application.ReadWrite.All` permission to obtain global admin. The
attacker uses the compromised SP to hijack the Office 365 Exchange
Online SP to add a new federated domain, which they can then abuse to
log in as any hybrid user. The researchers reported this vulnerability
to Microsoft, but it was dismissed as a configuration issue. 

 WHY XSS PERSISTS IN THIS FRAMEWORKS ERA? (24 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Modern frameworks block most HTML XSS through automatic escaping, but
XSS persists when developers bypass protections with WYSIWYG editors,
markdown parsers, or flawed sanitizers. Frameworks don't guard against
JavaScript XSS via URL attributes (href/src with javascript:) or eval
in OAuth flows, redirects, or postMessage. Even trusted libraries may
cause XSS if misused, and defenses like CSP and WAF are often
bypassed, so developers must treat all input as untrusted and reliably
use protections.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 UBLOCK ORIGIN LITE AVAILABLE FOR SAFARI (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 uBlock Origin Lite has been released for Safari on macOS and iOS
following the discontinuation of the original uBlock Origin. uBlock
Origin Lite provides best-in-class ad blocking without consuming CPU
or memory resources. 

 0DAY.TODAY ARCHIVE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 VulnCheck-OSS created a GitHub repo archiving tens of thousands of
exploits from 0day.today, a public exploit database that went offline
in early 2025 and returned without its decade of data. The archive
categorizes exploits (DoS, local, remote, shellcode, and web apps)
with an index.json file for access, including metadata like CVEs,
dates, and platforms. The project aims to prevent data loss and help
security researchers use historical proof-of-concepts for analysis and
detection. 

 SIMPLIFY ACCESS REVIEWS WITH TRELICA BY 1PASSWORD (4 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Trelica by 1Password introduced an access review feature that
automates SaaS user access audits across 350+ API integrations, custom
applications via APIs, and non-SCIM apps through CSV uploads. It
offers a standardized workflow with context (roles, access levels, and
issues), automated reviewer notifications, and inline actions for
deactivating users or updating permissions. Reviews produce exportable
audit reports with reviewer details and notes to meet compliance
standards like SOC 2, SOX, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001.

 API KEYS FOR BEDROCK: A BRIEF SECURITY OVERVIEW (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AWS has introduced the ability to create Bedrock API keys, which are
special API keys that are explicitly scoped to Bedrock. Long-term API
keys are tied to an automatically generated or existing IAM user, can
be configured with an expiration of up to 100 years, and are composed
of a magic 3-byte prefix, a human-readable section, and a
base64-encoded secret. Short-term API keys are scoped to a specific
user's session and have the format `bedrock-api-key-[BASE64]` where
[BASE64] is a base64-encoded pre-signed URL. 

 RESEARCHERS UNCOVER GPT-5 JAILBREAK AND ZERO-CLICK AI AGENT ATTACKS
EXPOSING CLOUD AND IOT SYSTEMS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers from NeuralTrust demonstrated a jailbreak against GPT-5
using "Echo Chamber" and storytelling to bypass ethical guardrails,
poisoning context to generate prohibited instructions without
triggering refusals. Zenity Labs revealed "AgentFlayer" attacks
exploiting ChatGPT Connectors, Cursor AI, and Microsoft Copilot via
prompt injections in documents, tickets, or emails to exfiltrate data
like API keys. These reveal how AI connected to external systems
increases attack surfaces, with Tel-Aviv University showing smart home
hijacking via poisoned calendar invites to Google's Gemini AI. 

 KREBSONSECURITY IN NEW 'MOST WANTED' HBO MAX SERIES (4 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Brian Krebs will be featured in a new four-part HBO Max series about
Finnish cybercriminal Julius Kivimäki, who was recently sentenced to
over six years for extorting a psychotherapy clinic and its patients.
The series explores Kivimäki's hacking career from age 14, including
DDoS attacks, swatting, and blackmailing 22,000 therapy patients.
Titled "Most Wanted: Teen Hacker," it will air weekly on Fridays
throughout September across multiple regions.

MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) returned after 4
years with 23 winners showcasing deliberately cryptic code, including
entries that abuse Unicode encoding to hide functionality and a
295-character program that displays the moon's current phase. 

 GERMANY LIMITS POLICE SPYWARE USE TO SERIOUS CRIMES (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Germany's Constitutional Court ruled that police spyware for
monitoring encrypted communications can only be used for serious
crimes carrying maximum sentences of at least three years, citing the
"very severe" privacy intrusion of such surveillance tools.
