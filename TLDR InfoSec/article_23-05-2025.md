ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACK OF CONTRACTOR WAS AT ROOT OF MASSIVE FEDERAL BREACH (5 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Opexus, which provides software services for processing US government
records, was compromised by two employees in an insider threat attack.
The two brothers at the center of the breach had destroyed more than
330 databases and removed more than 1,800 files related to one
government project. The FBI and other government agencies are
investigating the incident. 

 SENSITIVE DATA STOLEN IN WEST LOTHIAN CYBER ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 West Lothian Council's education network suffered a ransomware attack
by group "Interlock," affecting 143 schools and nurseries. Less than
10% of data was stolen, including personal information from lesson
planning and potentially medical/social work records. The schools
remain open with contingency plans. 

 RESEARCHERS DUMP 2B SCRAPED DISCORD MESSAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Brazilian researchers scraped over 2 billion public Discord messages
and published the anonymized data online. They anonymized the data by
replacing usernames with pseudonyms, hashing user identifiers, and
removing identifying features, yet some are concerned about its
efficacy. The researchers intended to offer a message corpus for other
studies. However, a Discord spokesperson noted that scraping violates
the platform's terms of service.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REMOTE PROMPT INJECTION IN GITLAB DUO LEADS TO SOURCE CODE THEFT (8
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 GitLab's AI assistant "Duo" contained an indirect prompt injection
vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate it through hidden
prompts in code. This could enable source code theft, phishing
attacks, malware distribution, and data exfiltration. Duo's deep
DevSecOps integration and browser-rendered Markdown responses create
an unusually wide attack surface compared to typical AI coding
assistants. 

 UNIT 42 DEVELOPS AGENTIC AI ATTACK FRAMEWORK (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Agentic AI has changed how threat actors approach systems, enabling
more customized, patient, and persistent campaigns. This post
identifies ways that threat actors use AI agents across every stage of
the attack chain from reconnaissance and initial access to pivoting,
persistence, and exfiltration. It highlights the need for defensive
tooling to adopt more agentic workflows to combat this threat. 

 HOW TO USE AWS TRANSFER FAMILY AND AMAZON GUARDDUTY FOR MALWARE
PROTECTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A solution post from AWS on utilizing AWS Transfer Family and
GuardDuty to scan files uploaded to an SFTP server. The workflow
utilizes Lambda functions with Step Functions to move uploaded files
to an S3 bucket, scan them with GuardDuty, clean infected files, and
then notify the user via SNS. Terraform files are provided to deploy
the solution.

 MONKEY365 (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Monkey365 is an Open-Source security tool that can easily conduct
security configuration reviews for Microsoft 365, Azure subscriptions,

 QTAP (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 QTap is an eBPF agent that captures traffic flowing through the Linux
kernel before and after TLS/SSL encryption and then passes it to
plugins to add additional context. 

 FBI WATCHDOG (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 FBI Watchdog is a cyber threat intelligence OSINT tool that monitors
domain DNS changes in real-time, specifically detecting law
enforcement seizures (ns1.fbi.seized.gov and ns2.fbi.seized.gov). It
alerts users via Telegram and Discord and captures screenshots of
seized domains.

 “MICROSOFT HAS SIMPLY GIVEN US NO OTHER OPTION,” SIGNAL SAYS AS
IT BLOCKS WINDOWS RECALL (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Signal is blocking Windows 11's Recall AI feature from screenshotting
its app by default, using a DRM API intended for copyrighted content.
Recall captures screenshots every three seconds, potentially exposing
private conversations. Signal took this step because Microsoft does
not provide proper developer tools to prevent apps from being indexed
by Recall. 

 IRISH PRIVACY WATCHDOG OKS META TO TRAIN AI ON EU FOLKS' POSTS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ireland's Data Protection Commission approved Meta's plan to use
European users' public social media posts for AI training starting May
27, despite ongoing legal challenges. Privacy group noyb and German
courts are fighting the decision, arguing Meta's "legitimate interest"
justification violates GDPR requirements for explicit user consent. 

 HACKING MY CAR, AND PROBABLY YOURS - SECURITY FLAWS IN VOLKSWAGEN'S
APP (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 After a security researcher purchased a new Volkswagen and found that
they were locked out of connecting to the app, they decided to attempt
to brute-force the app and discovered further vulnerabilities after
succeeding. The researcher discovered that the app leaked credentials
for other services, such as Salesforce and the owner's personal
details and vehicle service history, which could be accessed with only
a VIN. The researcher coordinated with Volkswagen, and as of May 6,
they were able to verify the fix.
