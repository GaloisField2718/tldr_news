 RESEARCH REPORT: THE TRUE COST OF CVE MANAGEMENT IN CONTAINERS
(SPONSOR) [3] 

 Chainguard interviewed security leaders [3] across various industries
to see how many hours they are spending on vulnerability management
tasks including scanning for, triaging, and remediating CVEs. Key
findings include:
‚è±Ô∏è Thousands of hours [3] annually are spent on CVE management.

üß∞ CVE remediation time depends on the ease of upgrading and testing
software, and developers often prioritize convenience [3] over the
number of CVEs in container images.

üí∏ CVE management drains resources [3], impacts developer
productivity, and hurts the ability to focus on critical business
tasks like supporting customers.
