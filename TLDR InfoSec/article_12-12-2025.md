ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PIERCE COUNTY LIBRARY DATA BREACH IMPACTS 340,000 (2 MINUTE READ) [5]


 Hackers accessed the Pierce County Library System's network in April
and stole data from more than 340,000 patrons, employees, and their
family members. Patron data includes names and dates of birth, while
employee-related data also covers Social Security numbers, IDs,
financial and health information. 

 SECURITY FLAWS IN FREEDOM CHAT APP EXPOSED USERS' PHONE NUMBERS AND
PINS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Two major flaws in Freedom Chat have been discovered: one allowed
attackers to enumerate nearly 2,000 users' phone numbers by
mass-guessing them against the app's servers, and another leaked
users' PIN codes to everyone in the default public channel via backend
responses. Freedom Chat reset all PINs, tightened rate limiting,
removed exposed numbers, and shipped an updated version. This is
founder Tanner Haas' second messaging app to face serious security
issues. 

 NEW OPENAI MODELS LIKELY POSE “HIGH” CYBERSECURITY RISK (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OpenAI has stated that the cybersecurity capabilities of its frontier
models are accelerating rapidly and that upcoming models are likely to
pose a “high” risk. OpenAI notes that in August, GPT-5 scored 27%
on a CTF, whereas last month GPT-5.1-Codex-Max scored 76%. OpenAI's
Fouad Martin points to the models' ability to work for extended
periods as a driving force behind this.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INFOSTEALER HAS ENTERED THE CHAT (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Criminals are exploiting interest in OpenAI's Atlas browser by buying
Google ads that point to a shared ChatGPT conversation posing as an
installation guide for a macOS “Atlas browser.” The guide
instructs users to run a one‑line Terminal command that silently
downloads a script, steals credentials, and deploys the AMOS
infostealer, which exfiltrates browser data, crypto‑wallet info,
documents, and more, while also installing a backdoor for persistent
remote access. 

 SECURING MCP SERVERS WITH 1PASSWORD (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations used by AI
development tools like Cursor and Claude Code typically store
plaintext API keys in mcp.json files, creating a risk of credential
exposure when repositories are pushed to version control or shared
with teammates. Developers can eliminate this risk by storing secrets
in 1Password vaults, referencing them using op://vault/item/field
syntax in .env files, and launching MCP servers with the 1Password CLI
command op run --env-file=.env to dynamically inject credentials at
runtime without persisting them on disk. This pattern ensures secrets
are decrypted only in memory during process execution and
automatically disappear when the process exits, preventing accidental
exposure in Git history while maintaining developer productivity. 

 WEAPONIZING THE AWS CLI FOR PERSISTENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The AWS CLI allows users to define command aliases that can run
arbitrary bash commands. A limitation that previous work faced when
trying to abuse aliases was that if an attacker overwrote a command
(such as `aws sts`) with a malicious alias, they could not call the
original command. This post introduces a one-liner that dynamically
modifies the alias file to restore the original command so it can be
used in the malicious alias and then restores the malicious alias
after running.

 10K DOCKER IMAGES SPRAY LIVE CLOUD CREDS ACROSS THE INTERNET (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Flare's research reveals that over 10,000 public Docker Hub images
expose active secrets from more than 100 organizations, including a
Fortune 500 company and a major bank, often via personal or “shadow
IT” accounts. These images leak API keys and other live credentials
for cloud, CI/CD, and AI services, and even when secrets are removed
from images, about three-quarters of the underlying keys remain valid,
leaving organizations open to compromise. 

 COPILOT'S NO-CODE AI AGENTS LIABLE TO LEAK COMPANY DATA (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Nontechnical employees can quickly build Copilot Studio agents that
connect to sensitive systems, but these bots are easily tricked into
ignoring security instructions, leaking customer data, and even
modifying records such as trip costs. Tenable's experiment with a
travel-booking bot shows how simple prompt injections expose credit
card details and abuse edit permissions. 

 STOP HACKLORE: AN OPEN LETTER (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A group of current and former CISOs, security leaders, and
practitioners has released an open letter urging the public,
employers, journalists, and policymakers to stop spreading outdated
security recommendations. Specifically, they cited: avoid public WiFi,
never scan QR codes, never charge devices from public USB ports, turn
off Bluetooth and NFC, regularly clear cookies, and regularly change
passwords as outdated advice. Instead, they recommend focusing on
reminding the public to keep critical devices and applications
updated, enabling MFA, and using strong passphrases and password
managers.
