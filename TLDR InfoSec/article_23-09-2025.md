ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MALICIOUS PYPI PACKAGES DELIVER SILENTSYNC RAT (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threat actors uploaded two malicious packages, sisaws and secmeasure,
to PyPI that typosquat legitimate libraries and deliver the SilentSync
RAT. This malware is downloaded from Pastebin and maintains
persistence through registry keys, crontab modifications, or launch
agents, depending on the operating system. SilentSync communicates
with a hardcoded C2 server at 200.58.107[.]25 over HTTP and steals
browser data, including credentials, history, autofill data, and
cookies from Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox while also enabling
remote command execution and file exfiltration. 

 GITHUB'S REPUTATION BEING EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS TO DISTRIBUTE
MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security researcher explains how they discovered a macOS malware
campaign spreading through SEO and GitHub links disguised as a
legitimate app. The GitHub page appears legit, featuring a demo and an
install command for Terminal. This command downloads malware and
clears all xattrs. The page also hosts a dmg with an obfuscated
osascript that executes a second script to remove quarantine and run
stackprep. 

 STELLANTIS DETECTS BREACH AT THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER FOR NORTH AMERICAN
CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Automaker Stellantis disclosed that a third-party service provider's
platform that supports North American customers was breached.
Stellantis stated that the exposed data included only basic contact
information and not financial information.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 UNMASKING AKIRA: THE RANSOMWARE TACTICS YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO IGNORE
(14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Based on ZenSec's analysis of over 30 Akira ransomware incidents from
2023 to 2025, the group primarily exploits SSL VPN vulnerabilities
(Cisco ASA, SonicWall, and WatchGuard) through missing MFA and
unpatched CVEs, then leverages Veeam backup system vulnerabilities for
privilege escalation and credential harvesting. Akira operates as a
double-extortion group, stealing data via tools like WinSCP and Rclone
(often within 3 hours), then encrypting systems at the hypervisor
level while using AnyDesk for persistent access. The group targets
backup infrastructure for destruction, publishes stolen data via
Tor-based leak sites using torrent links, and demonstrates a
playbook-driven approach similar to the defunct Conti ransomware
operation. 

 WHY CONTINUOUS PROFILING IS THE FOURTH PILLAR OF OBSERVABILITY (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Early profilers focused mainly on CPU and needed manually compiled
binaries, which caused high performance overhead. Today, profiling has
a lower impact and offers diverse signals that can be automatically
collected continuously. OpenTelemetry introduced a new category for
continuous profiling and considers adding it as a fourth pillar. 

 HOW TO AUTOMATICALLY DISABLE USERS IN AWS MANAGED MICROSOFT AD BASED
ON GUARDDUTY FINDINGS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Automatically disabling compromised user accounts helps organizations
reduce attack fallout. This tutorial demonstrates how to utilize
GuardDuty for detecting suspicious activity, triggering an AWS Step
Function to retrieve user information, and subsequently disabling the
account in AWS Directory Service for Microsoft AD. The last step can
also be done on a domain-joined EC2 instance if an organization
doesn't use AWS Managed AD.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EBOOK: SECURING AI AT THE ENDPOINT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 On-device AI has huge benefits, but it also creates new attack paths.
Dell and Intel's new eBook [12] explains how to position your
organization securely to take advantage of AI innovation at the
endpoint - including risks to watch out for, attack countermeasures,
and best practices for your fleet. Read the ebook (PDF, ungated) [12] 

 MICROSOFT-VULNERABLE-DRIVER-BLOCK-LISTS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Microsoft no longer provides the vulnerable driver block list in a
browsable web page, making it harder to access directly. Instead, the
list is only available as a downloadable ZIP file, which complicates
its use in SIEM products for lookups and other functions. This project
automates the download, extraction, and parsing of the ZIP file,
converting the data into CSV and JSON formats for seamless integration
with SIEM and security tools. 

 REGAL (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Regal is a linter and language server for the Rego policy language. 

 TOOLHIVE (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Toolhive provides a method to quickly deploy MCP servers that run in
isolated containers for added security.

 MICROSOFT ENTRA ID FLAW ALLOWED HIJACKING ANY COMPANY'S TENANT (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Security researcher Dirk-jan Mollema found a critical flaw that
combined undocumented "actor tokens" from Microsoft's legacy Access
Control Service with a bug in the deprecated Azure AD Graph API. This
flaw allowed complete takeover of any Microsoft Entra ID tenant with
Global Admin rights. The attack exploited unsigned actor tokens that
bypass security, generate no audit logs, and stay valid for 24 hours
without revocation, letting attackers impersonate users. Microsoft
patched the vulnerability CVE-2025-55241 within nine days of
disclosure in July. The flaw highlights ongoing risks from legacy
authentication systems lacking modern security controls. 

 FBI WARNS BAD ACTORS ARE SPOOFING THE IC3 CYBERCRIME REPORTING
WEBSITE (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The FBI warns that cybercriminals are creating fake versions of its
Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website to steal personal
information from victims attempting to report cyber crimes. The
spoofed sites use misspelled URLs, alternative domains, and poor
graphics to trick users into entering sensitive data, including names,
addresses, phone numbers, and banking information. Users should verify
they're on the official IC3 site by ensuring the URL is exactly
"www.ic3.gov" with HTTPS and avoid clicking on sponsored search
results that may redirect to fraudulent sites. 

 TELECOM EXEC: SALT TYPHOON INSPIRING OTHER HACKERS TO USE
UNCONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AT&T's CISO states hackers use Salt Typhoon's tactics like targeting
unprotected platforms, exploiting logging gaps, and using legitimate
tools for "living off the land" attacks. The Chinese group's success
has inspired threats to target weak spots beyond traditional security,
with attackers chaining exploits due to stronger defenses, prompting
innovation.
