ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FAKE PRETTIER EXTENSION ON VSCODE MARKETPLACE DROPPED ANIVIA STEALER
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Checkmarx Zero identified and removed a malicious VSCode extension,
"prettier-vscode-plus," within 4 hours of publication, limiting the
impact to 6 downloads and 3 installs before removal. The brandjacking
attack deployed Anivia Stealer (likely rebranded ZeroTrace, sold as
MaaS for €120/month) using fileless execution from memory and
sandbox evasion techniques to steal Windows credentials, data, and
WhatsApp chats. Security teams should implement extension vetting
controls and monitor developer tool installations, as supply chain
attacks targeting IDEs increasingly aim to compromise source code and
credentials. 

 US BANKS SCRAMBLE TO ASSESS DATA THEFT AFTER HACKERS BREACH FINANCIAL
TECH FIRM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Major US banks and financial firms are investigating data stolen in a
cyberattack targeting SitusAMC, a New York firm that serves hundreds
of lenders. The breach involved theft of corporate, legal, and
accounting records, but no malware was deployed. The full scope and
impact remain under review. The FBI and affected banks are working to
safeguard customer information and determine how many consumers may be
affected. 

 UPDATE FIREFOX TO PATCH CVE-2025-13016 VULNERABILITY AFFECTING 180
MILLION USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A critical memory vulnerability in Firefox's WebAssembly (Wasm)
engine, tracked as CVE-2025-13016, exposed 180 million users to remote
code execution risks for six months. The flaw involved a stack buffer
overflow within the Garbage Collection mechanism caused by an
incorrect memory pointer calculation, allowing attackers to hijack
program flow via malicious webpages. Security professionals should
ensure all instances of Firefox are updated to version 145 or ESR
140.5 immediately to mitigate this high-severity risk.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PUBLIC REPORT: GOOGLE PRIVATE AI COMPUTE REVIEW (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 NCC Group conducted a comprehensive security review of Google's
Private AI Compute system across two phases (April-September),
investing 100 person-days with 10 consultants to assess the
cloud-based AI system designed to extend mobile device capabilities
while maintaining local privacy guarantees. The review covered
architecture assessment, cryptographic implementations, IP-blinding
relay security, Outbound RPC Enforcement configuration, and frontend
server source code analysis. Security teams working on
privacy-preserving cloud AI architectures should examine the full
downloadable report for insights on attestation mechanisms, secure
enclaves, cryptographic protocols, and privacy-preserving
infrastructure design patterns. 

 HOW TO REPLICATE THE CLAUDE CODE ATTACK WITH PROMPTFOO (16 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 State actors weaponized Claude Code through jailbreaking (roleplay as
security researchers + task decomposition) rather than traditional
exploits, achieving 82% success rates in installing keyloggers,
reverse shells with systemd/.bashrc persistence, LD_PRELOAD hooks, and
exfiltrating SSH/API keys. The "lethal trifecta" vulnerability arises
when agents have access to private data, exposure to untrusted
content, and external communication ability. Traditional security
tools fail because jailbreak traffic appears legitimate and the attack
vector is semantic, not technical. Security teams must implement
deterministic access controls, use red team testing tools like
Promptfoo before deployment, and recognize that context-blind
guardrails and helpful-by-default bias create fundamental
vulnerabilities requiring semantic security defenses beyond
traditional WAF/IDS/AV solutions. 

 STOP PUTTING YOUR PASSWORDS INTO RANDOM WEBSITES (YES, SERIOUSLY, YOU
ARE THE PROBLEM) (14 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Organizations and individuals have been carelessly exposing sensitive
passwords, credentials, keys, and private data by pasting them into
public online code formatting tools like JSONFormatter and
CodeBeautify. These tools often let users save and share formatted
data through predictable URLs, leaving credentials easily discoverable
and accessible to anyone, including attackers. Thousands of secrets
belonging to major sectors such as government, banking, healthcare,
and critical infrastructure have been discovered. Never trust random
online tools with any sensitive information, as this habit creates
far-reaching security risks and exposure.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MINDLESS AUTOMATION WON'T SAVE OVERWHELMED SOC TEAMS (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Old-world automation has collapsed under the weight of the
ever-changing nature of the SOC, burying analysts in more work while
breaches increased. Mate Security [12] is pioneering WISDOM-LED
PERFORMANCE: infusing company and industry knowledge into every part
of the security organization - from junior and senior analysts to AI
agents. Become an elite SOC [12] 

 SANTAMON (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Santamon is an experimental macOS detection sidecar for Santa that
evaluates Endpoint Security telemetry locally using CEL rules. It
forwards only matched detections to a backend while keeping raw
telemetry on-device. Santamon leverages Santa's existing ESF sensor
capabilities, avoiding Apple entitlement requirements. It adds three
detection rule types: simple matching, time-window correlation, and
baseline (first-seen) tracking with optional process tree enrichment. 

 BLT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 OWASP BLT (Bug Logging Tool) is an open-source platform that
democratizes bug bounties and security research. Built by the
community for the community, BLT makes it easy for security
researchers, developers, and organizations to collaborate on finding
and fixing security vulnerabilities. 

 RAY SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Ray Security offers real-time, AI-driven data protection for
enterprises. Its platform learns and monitors data usage, applying
dynamic security controls to active data, detecting unusual behavior,
and automatically responding to threats without impeding operations.

 JPMORGAN, CITI, MORGAN STANLEY ASSESS FALLOUT FROM SITUSAMC DATA
BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SitusAMC, a mortgage data processor serving major banks including
JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, suffered a data exfiltration
attack discovered on November 12 that exposed corporate data and
potentially customer PII, including SSNs, financial details, and
employment records from loan applications. The attack used no
ransomware, focusing purely on data theft. It was contained through
credential resets, by disabling remote access, and by updating the
firewall. Financial institutions must strengthen third-party risk
management programs with written oversight policies per new SEC
Regulation S-P amendments, as vendor breaches now account for 30% of
financial sector incidents (up 15% YoY). 

 GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY EXFILTRATES DATA (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google Antigravity is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks
where poisoned content manipulates the AI into bypassing .gitignore
restrictions to steal sensitive credentials from .env files. The data
is exfiltrated via a browser subagent directed to a malicious URL,
exploiting default settings that allow autonomous command execution
and whitelist dangerous domains. Security professionals should
mitigate this risk by reviewing "Agent-assisted development"
permissions and strictly monitoring AI agent access to sensitive files
and external network traffic. 

 WORMGPT 4 AND KAWAIIGPT: NEW DARK LLMS BOOST CYBERCRIME AUTOMATION (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 WormGPT 4 and KawaiiGPT are new "dark LLMs" that empower less-skilled
cybercriminals by automating phishing, malware creation, and
reconnaissance without ethical guardrails. WormGPT 4 is a paid service
that offers malware generation capabilities. KawaiiGPT is a free,
open-source tool that facilitates social engineering and lateral
movement scripts. Security professionals should view these tools as a
new baseline for digital risk and prepare for a democratized threat
landscape where advanced attack capabilities are accessible to anyone
with an internet connection.
