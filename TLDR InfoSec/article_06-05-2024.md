 üÜï HOW SECUREFRAME IS USING GENAI FOR COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY
AUTOMATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There's a lot of noise about AI in security, but what does it look
like in practice? Secureframe's new AI-driven features [4] offer a
glimpse into the future of compliance automation:

 	* Using retrieval augmented generation to answer lengthy
questionnaires [4], while referencing accurate content from
Secureframe Comply and other knowledge bases
 	* Automatically extracting relevant information from hosted vendor
documents [5] such as SOC 2 reports.
 	* Streamlining creation of custom frameworks and risk treatments.
 	* Support for new AI compliance frameworks, NIST AI RMF and ISO
42001.

 HOW TO ENFORCE USAGE OF PRIVILEGED ACCESS WORKSTATIONS FOR ADMINS (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This community post explains how to enforce the use of Privileged
Access Workstations (PAWs) for administrators at Microsoft by using
Conditional Access policies to block logins from non-PAW devices. It
details steps such as tagging PAW devices, setting permissions in
Microsoft Graph Explorer, and creating a device-based Conditional
Access policy in the Entra Admin Center. 

 USING FEATURE FLAGS FOR SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post provides a few examples of why it can be effective for
security teams to adopt the use of feature flags. The proposed uses
are: to release unreviewed code that can be enabled once it has been
reviewed, to enable features only for external security testers as a
beta, and to be able to speed up security incident response. 

 SEMGREP FOR TERRAFORM SECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This article provides some use cases and examples of using Semgrep to
secure Terraform deployments. Some examples presented are to use
Semgrep to evangelize secure-by-default, internal modules, enforce
opinionated rules, and prevent unverified providers. The article also
works through an example of writing a custom rule for a more niche
scenario.

 A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW ON ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT
BEHAVIORS AND ITS DETECTION STRATEGY (54 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This research paper from Oxford University Press discusses advanced
persistent threats (APTs) and proposes a detection strategy based on
multi-stage attack behaviors and network vulnerabilities. It
emphasizes the importance of understanding APT attack-related
behaviors to improve detection accuracy and response. By integrating
attributes of APT attacks into detection methods, security experts can
enhance their ability to prevent these sophisticated threats.
