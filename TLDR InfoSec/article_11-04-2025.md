ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AKIRABOT SPAMMED 80,000 WEBSITES BY EMPLOYING CAPTCHA BYPASS &
NETWORK EVASION TECHNIQUES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 AkiraBot has spammed 80,000+ websites since September 2024. It uses
AI to create personalized messages that mention specific website
content, helping bypass spam filters. The framework employs advanced
CAPTCHA-bypassing techniques and rotates IP addresses to avoid
detection. 

 US SENSOR GIANT SENSATA ADMITS RANSOMWARE DERAILED OPS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Sensor manufacturer Sensata reported a ransomware attack on April 6
that encrypted devices and disrupted operations including shipping,
manufacturing, and support functions. While the company is still
investigating the breach with cybersecurity experts, it doesn't expect
material financial impact yet the situation is still developing. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT WORDPRESS PLUGIN AUTH BYPASS HOURS AFTER DISCLOSURE
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hackers quickly exploited a security flaw in the OttoKit plugin for
WordPress, allowing unauthorized access to websites. Users are urged
to update to version 1.0.79 to prevent potential breaches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE S IN MCP STANDS FOR SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new standard that defines how LLMs
integrate with tools. It lacks authentication or other security
integrations by default. Some risks associated with MCPs are injection
risks due to poor coding practices, tool poisoning due to embedding
malicious instructions inside the MCP tool's description, silently
redefining tool definitions, and cross-server tool shadowing. Users
and developers should continue to employ security fundamentals such as
using trusted sources, employing input validation, and pinning MCP
server + tool versions. Platform builders can enhance security by
displaying full tool metadata, using integrity hashes for server
updates, and enforcing session security. 

 HOW TO USE THE NEW CLOUDTRAIL NETWORK ACTIVITY EVENTS FOR VPC
ENDPOINTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS recently launched a new class of CloudTrail logs that track
network activity events for VPC endpoints. These logs can be used to
assess the impact of proposed VPC endpoint policies in organizations
that don't currently use endpoint policies and to detect data
exfiltration. Any organization that uses VPC endpoints should enable
network activity events for VpceAccessDenied errors and evaluate
further events based on cost and utility. 

 ENTROPY TRIAGE: A METHOD TO REPAIR FILES CORRUPTED BY FAILED
RANSOMWARE ENCRYPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sometimes after an organization pays a ransom and receives a
decryptor, the decryption process may still fail due to the encryption
process failing or being interrupted. Researchers from MOXFIVE have
developed a technique called entropy triage that processes each block
of a file by comparing the Shannon entropy before and after decryption
and writing the lower entropy block to disk. MOXFIVE has had success
with this method but notes that it requires skilled cryptographers and
data to be sufficiently encrypted or decrypted for the analysis.

 UK CYBER SECURITY BREACHES SURVEY 2025 REVEALS PERSISTENT THREATS IN
EVOLVING DIGITAL LANDSCAPE, BATS FOR ENHANCED CYBER RESILIENCE (7
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The 2025 UK Cyber Security Breaches Survey shows 43% of businesses
experienced cyber attacks. Phishing was the most common attack pattern
while ransomware attacks doubled. Despite improved cybersecurity
measures among small businesses, board-level responsibility has
declined, creating gaps as threats continue to evolve. 

 GOOGLE EYES USER BROWSING DATA SEARCH IN NEW PATENT FILING (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Google has filed a patent for a system that helps users search their
digital history using natural language. This system aims to make it
easier for users to find previously viewed content without remembering
exact keywords. While promising convenience, concerns about data
privacy and user control have been raised. 

 RESEARCHERS HACK SOURCE CODE FROM GOOGLE GEMINI (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 As part of Google's bugSWAT event, a group of security researchers
managed to exfiltrate a sensitive binary from Gemini's Python Sandbox.
The researchers first discovered that the sandbox provides full access
to the os library which allowed them to map the sandbox's filesystem
and locate the /usr/bin/entry/entry_point binary which they
exfiltrated by returning 10MB chunks of base64 encoded data to the
frontend. After reassembling it, the researchers found source code for
the sandbox's Python interpreter and protobufs that describe how
sensitive data is classified, handled, and transmitted within Google.
