 PEN TESTING IS BROKEN. THREATSPIKE RED HAS THE FIX (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The traditional pen testing model is slow and expensive: pay
thousands per day for a single test, wait weeks for scoping and
scheduling, then get one snapshot report that's outdated on arrival.

ThreatSpike Red [4] flips this on its head with unlimited pen testing
for a flat subscription fee. Run what you need, when you need it —
from web app assessments to full red team exercises.

Unlike automated tools, ThreatSpike Red delivers testing by
CREST-certified professionals [4] who understand your environment. Get
continuous, expert-level security testing without the traditional
bottlenecks.

Stop renting pen tests. Own them. See how ThreatSpike Red works [4].

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CHILDREN'S NAMES, PICTURES, AND ADDRESSES STOLEN IN NURSERY CHAIN
HACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new ransomware gang called Radiant has hacked a chain of nurseries
called Kido and stolen the data of 8,000 children. The breached data
includes names, pictures, and addresses. The criminals contacted the
BBC directly and stated that they hadn't asked for a high ransom and
viewed it as compensation for performing a pentest, even though no
pentest was authorized. 

 SCREENCONNECT SUPER ADMIN CREDENTIAL HARVESTING (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Mimecast is reporting on a low-volume spear-phishing campaign that
has been active since 2022, targeting super admins of ScreenConnect
instances. The attackers send an email warning admins of a new login
attempt and prompting them to review it, and if they click through, it
directs the admins to an EvilGnix phishing page that harvests their
credentials. The attackers use the access to deploy compromised
clients and ransomware. 

 GOOGLE ADS USED TO SPREAD TROJAN DISGUISED AS TRADINGVIEW PREMIUM (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A malicious advertising campaign offering "free access" to
TradingView Premium has expanded from Facebook to Google Ads and
YouTube, using over 500 website addresses and hijacking verified
business accounts to spread the Trojan.Agent.GOSL spyware. The
scammers take control of legitimate YouTube channels, delete the
original content, and rebrand them to mimic the official TradingView
page, using unlisted videos and paid advertising to avoid detection.
The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including
passwords, personal data, and cryptocurrency wallet details. One fake
video gathered over 182,000 views in just a few days.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TAMING 2,500 COMPILER WARNINGS WITH CODEQL, AN OPENVPN2 CASE STUDY (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trail of Bits created a sophisticated CodeQL query to analyze 2,500
implicit integer conversion warnings in OpenVPN2, filtering them down
to 20 security insights through iterative methods, including range
analysis, and focusing on user-controlled inputs. Its five-step
approach combined compiler warnings with static analysis techniques
such as taint tracking and function modeling to differentiate between
safe conversions and potential vulnerabilities. Although most
conversions were safe, its team concluded that specialized analysis is
necessary to identify risky cases. They did not find any exploitable
vulnerabilities but did produce a reusable query for C codebases. 

 ADVANCED CYBERCHEF TECHNIQUES - DEFEATING NANOCORE OBFUSCATION WITH
MATH AND FLOW CONTROL (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security researchers utilized CyberChef to deobfuscate a Nanocore VBS
loader, which encoded ASCII characters using mathematical operations
and hexadecimal values. They utilized subsection tools and flow
control to isolate operators, convert hex, perform calculations, and
decode ASCII, demonstrating how advanced techniques can reverse
complex obfuscations.

 YOUR AI MODELS ARE RUNNING ON DEVICES BUILT BEFORE AI EXISTED –
THAT'S A PROBLEM (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Cyberattackers are waging war on training data and AI models, but
your Windows 10 fleet can't detect threats below the OS. Dell AI PCs
[11]detect BIOS tampering and supply chain attacks at the hardware
level, while integrated CrowdStrike and Absolute software enforce
zero-trust model access controls. Learn what makes Dell AI PCs the
world's most secure [11] 

 INTRODUCING NEW REGIONAL INTERNET TRAFFIC AND CERTIFICATE
TRANSPARENCY INSIGHTS ON CLOUDFLARE RADAR (15 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cloudflare Radar added two features: regional traffic insights
showing sub-national Internet patterns via administrative divisions,
and comprehensive Certificate Transparency (CT) data expanding on the
Merkle Town dashboard. The regional insights reveal localized traffic
trends, such as mobile vs. desktop usage, and the impacts of weather
or infrastructure issues. The CT data provides analysis of certificate
issuance, CA activity, and log metrics. These features enhance Radar's
goal of detailed Internet health and security visibility through
dashboards, APIs, and Radar's Data Explorer. 

 OMNIPROXY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 OmniProx is a command-line tool designed for security professionals
to deploy and manage HTTP proxies across various cloud providers,
including Azure, GCP, Cloudflare, and Alibaba Cloud, through a single
interface. It offers IP and header rotation for web scraping,
reconnaissance, or privacy, and is designed to utilize free tiers for
cost efficiency. However, security teams should be aware that it could
be misused for malicious activities such as bypassing rate limits,
evading detection, or unauthorized reconnaissance. 

 WERDUMP (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 WerDump is a Beacon Object File (BOF) for Havoc and Cobalt Strike
that allows dumping Process Protected Lsass using WerFaultSecure.

 DUTCH TEENS ARRESTED FOR TRYING TO SPY ON EUROPOL FOR RUSSIA (1
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Two 17-year-old Dutch teens were arrested near Europol, Eurojust, and
the Canadian embassy in The Hague for allegedly using WiFi sniffing
devices to spy for Russia. Recruited via Telegram, they were detained
after a Dutch intelligence tip, with one arrest occurring at home
while the suspect was doing homework, unaware of their activities.
Europol confirmed the incident but said its systems weren't
compromised, marking a shift from Russian youth recruitment for
vandalism to espionage. 

 HACKERS USE FAKE INVOICES TO SPREAD XWORM RAT VIA OFFICE FILES (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cybercriminals are distributing XWorm RAT through fake Spanish
invoice emails containing malicious .xlam Office files that appear
blank when opened but execute hidden shellcode to download additional
payloads. The attack chain employs reflective DLL injection and
process injection techniques to embed the malware within legitimate
processes, thereby enabling complete remote system control, including
keystroke logging and file theft, while establishing a connection to a
C2 server at 158.94.209.180. This represents a continuation of XWorm
campaigns that have compromised over 18,000 devices globally this
year, with attackers increasingly leveraging trusted platforms, such
as AWS S3, for payload distribution. 

 MEDUSA RANSOMWARE CLAIMS COMCAST DATA BREACH, DEMANDS $1.2M (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The Medusa ransomware group claims to have exfiltrated 834.4 GB of
data from Comcast Corporation and is demanding $1.2 million either as
ransom for deletion or as a sale price to interested buyers. As proof,
the attackers posted approximately 20 screenshots of alleged internal
files, along with a listing of 167,121 file entries containing
actuarial reports, insurance modeling scripts, claim analytics, and
product management data, including files such as Python and SQL
scripts related to auto premium analysis. Comcast has not confirmed or
denied the breach. It experienced a credential leak in 2015 that
affected over 200,000 users. The breach was attributed to credential
aggregation and not a system breach.
