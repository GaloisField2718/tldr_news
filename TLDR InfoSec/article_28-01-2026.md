 42% OF KIDS AGES 3-5 HAVE UNINTENTIONALLY SHARED PERSONAL DATA ONLINE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 It's 10 PM. Do you know what your child is doing online? 

Cybersecurity leader Bitwarden surveyed over 1,000 US parents [4] with
children ages 2 to 20. Surprises include:

👀 28% of 3 to 5-year-olds browse online with minimal or no
supervision from their parents.

👀 80% of Gen Z parents fear their children will fall victim to
AI-enhanced online threats, but 37% give their child full autonomy or
only lightly monitor their online activity.

👉 The good news? There's a simple step you can take today.
Bitwarden makes it easy to protect what matters most. Secure your
family's logins, payment info, and personal data in one place, giving

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 KUBERNETES REMOTE CODE EXECUTION VIA NODES/PROXY GET PERMISSION (11
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 An authorization bypass in Kubernetes allows service accounts with
nodes/proxy GET permissions to execute commands in any Pod across the
cluster, potentially leading to full cluster compromise. The
vulnerability stems from the Kubelet authorizing WebSocket connections
based on the initial HTTP GET handshake rather than verifying CREATE
permissions for the /exec endpoint, affecting 69 Helm charts,
including Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana, and Cilium. Kubernetes
Security Team closed this as "Won't Fix (Working as Intended),"
recommending migration to KEP-2862's fine-grained authorization when
it reaches GA in April. 

 NETSUPPORT MANAGER 0-DAY VULNERABILITIES ENABLE REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two critical vulnerabilities in NetSupport Manager (CVE-2025-34164
and CVE-2025-34165) can be chained to achieve unauthenticated remote
code execution through the software's undocumented broadcast feature,
which operates on TCP port 5405 without requiring authentication. The
flaws—a heap-based out-of-bounds write and a stack-based
out-of-bounds read—enable attackers to bypass ASLR, perform
arbitrary memory writes, and gain remote shell access, posing a
significant risk to Operational Technology (OT) environments where the
software is commonly deployed. Organizations should upgrade to version
14.12.0000 or later and restrict access to port 5405 as an interim
mitigation. 

 CANVA AMONG ~100 TARGETS OF SHINYHUNTERS OKTA IDENTITY-THEFT CAMPAIGN
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ShinyHunters is running an Okta single sign-on credential-stealing
campaign against roughly 100 high-value organizations, including
Canva, Atlassian, RingCentral, and others. The group uses evolved
voice phishing to capture SSO logins, enroll its own devices in MFA,
pivot into SaaS apps, exfiltrate data, and then extort victims. There
is no confirmation of which named firms were successfully breached.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHO OPERATES THE BADBOX 2.0 BOTNET? (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A leaked screenshot from Kimwolf botnet operators revealed they had
compromised the Badbox 2.0 control panel, exposing seven authorized
user email addresses that OSINT investigation traced to Chen Daihai
and Zhu Zhiyu of Beijing Astrolink Wireless Digital
Technology—individuals whose domains were previously flagged in
HUMAN Security's Badbox 2.0 report. The investigation used password
reuse across breach databases, domain registration records, and social
media pivots to connect qq.com email addresses to multiple Chinese
technology companies distributing pre-infected Android TV boxes. This
unauthorized access allows Kimwolf to bypass residential proxy
mitigations by loading malware directly onto Badbox 2.0's 10+ million
compromised devices. 

 HOW TO ENCRYPT YOUR PC'S DISK WITHOUT GIVING THE KEYS TO MICROSOFT (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 BitLocker encrypts Windows PCs to protect data, but many systems
automatically store recovery keys with Microsoft when users sign in
with a Microsoft account, creating a potential privacy risk if
authorities obtain those keys. By upgrading to Windows 11 Pro, users
can fully control BitLocker, decrypt any existing Microsoft-managed
setup, and re-encrypt the drive while saving the recovery key locally,
such as on paper or an external drive, rather than in the cloud. 

 LLM KEY SERVER: PROVIDING SECURE AND CONVENIENT ACCESS TO INTERNAL
LLM APIS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mercari's AI Security team developed a key server to address the
challenge of managing API key-based access to LLMs. The key server
uses Google Workspace and Google Cloud for OIDC authentication to
LiteLLM, which provides time-limited API access to various models
through a unified API. The team also developed an internal CLI, GitHub
Action, and Google Apps Script template to support adoption of the LLM
key server.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AGENT OS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Agent OS applies operating system concepts to AI agent governance,
providing kernel-level policy enforcement that intercepts and blocks
actions before execution rather than relying on prompt-based safety.
The framework includes POSIX-inspired primitives such as signals, a
virtual filesystem for agent memory, cross-model verification,
inter-agent trust protocols with cryptographic signing, and
integrations with LangChain, CrewAI, and OpenAI Assistants. An MCP
server enables integration between Claude Desktop and tools for
verification and kernel execution.

 Awesome hacking is a curated list of hacking tools for hackers,
pentesters, and security researchers. Its goal is to collect,
classify, and make awesome tools easy to find by humans, creating a
toolset you can checkout and update with one command.

 WHY HAS MICROSOFT BEEN ROUTING EXAMPLE.COM TRAFFIC TO A COMPANY IN
JAPAN? (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft's autodiscover service was found routing email traffic for
example.com—a domain reserved for testing under RFC2606—to
subdomains belonging to Sumitomo Electric in Japan, potentially
causing test credentials to be sent outside Microsoft's network. The
misconfiguration, which may have persisted for five years, has been
suppressed, but Microsoft has not explained how the Japanese company's
servers were added to its network configuration. The incident raises
concerns about other potential misconfigurations following Microsoft's
2024 breach, where forgotten test account privileges enabled Russian
state hackers to monitor executive emails. 

 BROWSER-BASED ATTACKS HIT 95% OF ENTERPRISES — AND TRADITIONAL
SECURITY TOOLS NEVER SAW THEM COMING (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 95% of organizations experienced browser-based attacks last year that
evaded traditional security tools. Attackers operated inside trusted
sessions where web gateways, cloud access brokers, and endpoint
protection lose visibility after login. Recent incidents, including
ShadyPanda's weaponized extensions and Cyberhaven's supply chain
compromise, demonstrate how attackers exploit browser auto-updates and
session tokens rather than zero-days. Security leaders recommend
inventorying extensions, implementing 48-72 hour auto-update delays,
and moving data protection to the browser layer, where 64% of
encrypted traffic currently goes uninspected. 

 NOYB WIN: MICROSOFT ORDERED TO STOP TRACKING SCHOOL CHILDREN (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Austria's data protection authority ruled that Microsoft illegally
placed tracking cookies on a pupil's device through Microsoft 365
Education, using them to analyse behaviour, collect browser data, and
support advertising. The authority ordered Microsoft to stop tracking
the child within four weeks and rejected Microsoft's attempt to shift
responsibility to its Irish subsidiary.
