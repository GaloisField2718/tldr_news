 HOW RAXIS USES ONLINE DATA TO BREAK INTO A LIVE TARGET (SPONSOR) [4] 

 What happens when Red Teamers are unleashed on a live target?

In this video (2:20 minutes) [4], watch how Raxis uses available
online signals to collect intel ‚Äî which they then use to enter a
physical office, penetrate an internal network, and launch a
specialized spearfish to grab credentials.

Bad actors will try all of these methods and more to gain access to
your sensitive data. That's why clients choose Raxis [4] to attack and
document ‚Äî so they can reinforce and remediate.

(P.S.: Raxis also works with security resellers [5])

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE WARNS OF CRITICAL STOREONCE AUTH BYPASS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has patched eight significant
security vulnerabilities in its StoreOnce backup software. A critical
flaw enables attackers to bypass login checks and gain system access.
HPE recommends that all users promptly upgrade to version 4.3.11 to
protect against these issues. 

 MALICIOUS RUBYGEMS POSE AS FASTLANE TO STEAL TELEGRAM API DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at Socket identified two malicious Ruby gems
impersonating the fastlane-plugin-telegram gem, which is used for
sending CI/CD updates from Fastlane to a Telegram channel. The
typosquatted gems are nearly identical to the legitimate gem except
that they redirect Telegram API calls to an attacker-controlled
server. Any bot tokens that were used in builds with the malicious
gems should be considered compromised. 

 35K SOLAR POWER SYSTEMS EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cybersecurity researchers at Forescout have discovered that roughly
35k solar power systems are internet exposed. These devices were found
by searching on Shodan and many are vulnerable to existing exploits.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I USED O3 TO FIND CVE-2025-37899, A REMOTE ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITY
IN THE LINUX KERNEL'S SMB IMPLEMENTATION (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A security researcher used OpenAI's o3 model to find CVE-2025-37899,
a previously unknown zero-day use-after-free vulnerability in the
Linux kernel's SMB implementation (ksmbd). The flaw occurs when one
thread frees a session user object while another thread on a
concurrent connection is still accessing it, leading to potential
kernel memory corruption. This represents the first documented case of
an LLM discovering a vulnerability requiring complex reasoning about
concurrent execution paths, demonstrating that o3 has achieved a
significant breakthrough in automated code analysis capabilities that
can be utilized for bug hunting. 

 PATCHGUARD INTERNALS (30 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PatchGuard (Kernel Patch Protection) is a Windows kernel mitigation
introduced in 2005 that monitors critical kernel structures like IDT,
GDT, MSRs, and SSDT, triggering a BSOD with error code 0x109 for
unauthorized modifications. It employs randomized activation methods,
such as timers and hidden DPCs, making its behavior unpredictable and
hard to reverse engineer. Bypasses exist through boot-time patches and
hypervisor-based rootkits that use Extended Page Tables (EPT) to hide
changes, but both require disabling Secure Boot.

 SMART CARS, DUMB PASSWORDS: AUTO INDUSTRY STILL RUNS ON WEAK
PASSWORDS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Many car companies rely on weak and reused passwords like "123456"
for system security, making them vulnerable to hackers. This lax
security puts smart cars and sensitive company data at risk. Experts
recommend stronger passwords, employee training, and multi-factor
authentication to enhance protection against cyberattacks. 

 MICROSOFT WANTS WINDOWS UPDATE TO HANDLE ALL APPS (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Microsoft has announced that it is opening up the Windows Update
system to developers via a new orchestration platform. Hooking into
the Windows Update orchestration platform will allow developers to
take advantage of scheduled updates based on user activity, battery
status, and even sustainable energy timing. Developers can also make
use of the Windows Update notifications.
