 WHAT COMES AFTER THE CORPORATE FIREWALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The corporate firewall is a relic of bygone times. With employees
working from coffee shops, airports, and home networks, traditional
perimeter security leaves your endpoints exposed to unmanaged devices
and compromised networks.

ThreatLocker Network Control [5] brings the firewall to each endpoint
with dynamic ACLs that automatically adjust based on location. Unlike
VPNs that route through central points, it creates direct, secure
endpoint-to-endpoint connections [5].

⚡ Create custom policies to open ports on demand for approved
devices and users.

⚡ Ports auto-close within 5 minutes when not in use.

⚡ Manage all endpoint firewalls from one console.

✅ No IT tickets needed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ERMAC V3.0 BANKING TROJAN SOURCE CODE LEAK EXPOSES FULL MALWARE
INFRASTRUCTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Complete source code for Android banking Trojan ERMAC 3.0 leaked from
an open directory, revealing a Malware as a Service (MaaS)
infrastructure targeting over 700 banking, shopping, and
cryptocurrency apps. The leak exposed critical security flaws,
including hardcoded JWT secrets, static admin tokens, and default
credentials in the malware's PHP/Laravel backend and React frontend.
ERMAC 3.0 features enhanced form injection methods, AES-CBC encrypted
communications, and a Kotlin-based Android backdoor that avoids
infecting devices in countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS). 

 PLEX WARNS USERS TO PATCH SECURITY VULNERABILITY IMMEDIATELY (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Plex has reached out to some of its users and urged them to update
their Plex Media Server installation due to a recently patched
security vulnerability. Plex has not assigned a CVE to the
vulnerability or released details yet, but has stated that it was
discovered via the Plex bug bounty program. 

 UK TELECOM FIRM COLT SUFFERS MASSIVE RANSOMWARE ATTACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The Warlock ransomware gang targeted the UK telecommunications firm
Colt, causing disruptions to its online and voice services. In
response, Colt took its systems offline, resulting in service
interruptions, and is currently in the process of restoring
operations. The attackers have claimed to have stolen sensitive data,
potentially exploiting a flaw in Microsoft SharePoint.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PROTECTING AGAINST TYPOSQUATTING WITH WEBSITE TYPO PROTECTION IN
MICROSOFT EDGE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Website typo protection is an automatically enabled, typosquatting
protection in Microsoft Edge. Upon typing a misspelling of a common
domain in Edge, the user will get a notification of the potential
typo, and the address bar will include a “Not Secure” badge
(similar to when visiting a website without HTTPS). This post provides
details for configuring protection if it isn't enabled and includes
screenshots of the notifications. 

 POST-QUANTUM TLS IN PYTHON (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In preparation for the creation of a Cryptographically Relevant
Quantum Computer (CRQC), NIST selected three post-quantum (PQ)
cryptographic standards. This post details how to test hybrid TLS,
where classical keys are used in combination with PQ ML-KEM keys, in
Python on AWS. boto3, the Python SDK for AWS, relies upon the Python
`ssl` module, which in turn relies on OpenSSL, which added support for
hybrid TLS in version 3.5. 

 KAFKA ENCRYPTION FOR CARDHOLDER DATA: SOLVING PCI CHALLENGES WITH
KROXYLICIOUS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This article explains how to achieve end-to-end encryption of credit
card data in Kafka without changing any application code, using the
Kroxylicious proxy. This solution simplifies PCI compliance and data
protection by encrypting messages transparently, minimizing disruption
to existing systems and workflows.
