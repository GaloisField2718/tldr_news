 CRITICAL CISCO SMART LICENSING UTILITY FLAWS NOW EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cisco Smart Licensing Utility (CSLU) is a Windows application that
allows admins to manage licenses and linked products on-prem without
connecting them to Cisco's cloud licensing software. In September,
Cisco patched a vulnerability that exposed an undocumented, static
credential for a built-in admin account and allowed unauthenticated
users to access log files containing sensitive data. SANS' Dean of
Research reports that threat actors are now chaining these two
vulnerabilities to exploit internet-exposed CSLU instances.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY GOOGLE MADE A $32 BILLION BET ON WIZ (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google has acquired cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion, its
most expensive purchase ever. This move aims to strengthen Google
Cloud against rivals Microsoft and Amazon, whose cloud services
generate significantly more revenue. 

 AI CLOUD ADOPTION IS RIFE WITH CYBER MISTAKES (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Tenable's 2025 report revealed that most organizations deploy AI
services in cloud environments with dangerous default configurations,
with 91% enabling root access in Amazon SageMaker. This "Jenga-like"
approach, where compromising one service affects all connected
services, mirrors early cloud deployment mistakes. 

 INFOSTEALER CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISPS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Splunk Threat Research Team identified a new campaign targeting
ISP infrastructure. Attackers use weak credentials to gain initial
access, downloading malware from a C2 server that runs a crypto miner
and an infostealer to detect crypto wallet passphrases and take
screenshots. They establish persistence and pivot to additional IP
CIDRs, utilizing Python and Powershell scripts to maintain a minimal
presence, including IoCs in the post.

MINUTE READ) [15]

 ARRESTS IN TAP-TO-PAY SCHEME POWERED BY PHISHING (4 MINUTE READ) [16]

phished payment cards in mobile wallets to purchase gift cards. They
used a custom Android app called "Z-NFC" that could relay NFC
transactions from phones in China with stolen card information. 

 SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY IS FUBAR - A PROPOSAL FOR GITHUB (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The tj-actions and xz utils supply chain attacks have highlighted the
issues that exist in establishing a maintainer's identity on GitHub.
GitHub should require certain security features on a repository once
it hits a certain popularity threshold, such as signed commits, PRs,
blocking force pushes with an emergency override system, and 2FA for
all admin credentials and maintainers. It should create an opt-in
standard for verifying open-source maintainer identities, managing
roster changes, and maintaining public audit logs and security
settings. GitHub could also implement a production version of
Chainguard's octo-sts for short-lived runner credentials and check for
typosquatting in GitHub Actions.
