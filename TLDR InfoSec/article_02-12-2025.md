 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's phishing attacks involve AI-generated voices, videos, and
interactive deepfakes of company executives. They fool 99% of people.

Adaptive Security - backed by $65M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z -
is the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered
social engineering [4]. Adaptive trains your team with tools that stay
one step ahead:

 	* Deepfake attack simulations featuring your real executives in
realistic attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, personalized training content tailored for each
employee
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that reveals what attackers can learn from
your public data

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PRIVILEGE ESCALATION WITH SAGEMAKER AND THERE'S MORE HIDING IN
EXECUTION ROLES (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Privilege escalation flaws have been discovered in AWS SageMaker.
Attackers with specific permissions can inject malicious code via
lifecycle configurations, mimicking EC2 user data escalation and
affecting Lambda and CloudFormation. It is important to detect
stop-modify-start sequences in CloudTrail and implement strict access
controls. 

 TOP SOUTH KOREAN E-COMMERCE FIRM COUPANG APOLOGISES OVER MASSIVE DATA
BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang disclosed unauthorized access
that affected 33.7 million customer accounts beginning June 24 through
overseas servers, exposing names, email addresses, phone numbers,
shipping addresses, and order histories. Authorities are investigating
a suspected Chinese former employee. The government is examining
potential personal information protection violations. This is the
country's worst data breach in over a decade. 

 SMARTTUBE YOUTUBE APP FOR ANDROID TV BREACHED TO PUSH MALICIOUS
UPDATE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The popular open-source SmartTube YouTube client for Android TV,
which provides ad blocking and runs well on low-powered devices, was
compromised after an attacker gained access to the developer's signing
keys. The compromise was detected when multiple users reported that
Play Protect blocked SmartTube. The app developer confirmed that his
digital keys were compromised and stated that he had revoked the old
signature and would publish a new version with a separate app ID.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BIND LINK – EDR TAMPERING (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Threat actors can abuse Windows 11's Bind Link API through the
bindflt.sys driver to redirect EDR installation folders to
attacker-controlled directories, enabling DLL hijacking and code
execution under EDR context. The EDR-Redir proof of concept uses
LoadLibraryW to load bindfltapi.dll and CreateDirectoryW to create
transparent folder mappings between virtual and backing paths.
CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, and Carbon Black have implemented BindFlt
monitoring, while Microsoft Defender for Endpoint remains vulnerable.
Security teams should deploy Sysmon Event ID 7 monitoring for
bindfltapi.dll image load events, validate whether legitimate bind
link usage exists in their environment to reduce false positives, and
investigate EDR vendor support for bindflt driver activity detection. 

 START USING WINDOWS AUTOPATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Microsoft Intune provides an endpoint management suite for Windows
devices. Windows Autopatch is built into Intune and allows
administrators to define groups to gradually roll out to an
organization. Administrators can also configure hot patching on
devices to expedite compliance. 

 SHAI HULUD 2.0: ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES (9 MINUTE READ) [11]


 Shai Hulud 2.0 is a large-scale software supply chain attack that
compromised many popular npm packages, including ones tied to services
like Zapier, ENS Domains, PostHog, and Postman, in order to steal
secrets and establish remote code execution via GitHub runners.
Defenders are advised to use published IOCs and scanners to identify
infected packages and leftover malware files, treat any secrets on
affected machines as compromised, and rotate or revoke them.

MISCELLANEOUS

 TOMIRIS SHIFTS TO PUBLIC-SERVICE IMPLANTS FOR STEALTHIER C2 IN
ATTACKS ON GOVERNMENT TARGETS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Tomiris is a Kazakhstan-linked threat actor that leverages Telegram
and Discord as command-and-control infrastructure while targeting
foreign ministries and government entities across Russia and Central
Asia through spear-phishing campaigns. The attack deploys
multi-language malware, including Rust-based downloaders, Python-based
backdoors like Distopia, and custom implants. Over 50% of lures use
Russian-language content to blend malicious traffic with legitimate
service activity. Security teams should monitor for unusual Telegram
and Discord API traffic patterns, implement application control
policies that restrict execution from archive files, and deploy
behavioral detection to detect persistence mechanisms targeting
Windows Registry modifications associated with these custom implant
families. 

 AWS PRE:INVENT SECURITY HIGHLIGHTS: WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT MATTERS
(5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AWS has added a new CLI command, `aws login`, which allows users to
obtain short-lived credentials for AWS even if the account isn't
configured with IAM Identity Center. AWS IAM Outbound Identity
Federation now allows AWS users or services to request a short-lived
JWT for external services that trust your AWS account, which can
replace the use of hardcoded, long-term credentials or API keys in
Lambda or EC2. AWS has also enabled Attribute-Based Access Control
(ABAC) for S3, which allows users to define access permissions to S3
using tags instead of listing every bucket in an IAM policy. 

 PURPLE TEAM MATURITY MODEL: FROM CHAOS TO CONTROLLED CHAOS (4 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Organizations that wish to start with purple teaming can begin by
defining a purple team strategy with loosely scheduled sessions,
referencing MITRE ATT&CK tactics in testing, and feeding early
detection gaps into detection engineering. Teams can then introduce
metrics as they mature, begin using more structured purple team
exercises, and map red team TTPs more closely to MITRE ATT&CK tactics
and threat intel. As teams further mature, they can introduce
automated adversary emulation. Eventually, purple teaming can be
driven by threat-intel, continuously run fully automated attack
chains, and integrate machine learning, SOAR, and XDR to power rapid
detection and response.
