ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MITRE SAYS STATE HACKERS BREACHED ITS NETWORK VIA IVANTI ZERO DAYS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 MITRE announced that it has discovered a network breach due to two
chained Ivanti VPN zero days. The threat actors bypassed MFA via
session hijacking to move laterally across the network and deployed a
combination of webshells and backdoors to harvest credentials and
maintain access. Evidence collected thus far shows that the attackers
did not breach the core enterprise network or partner networks. 

 CHANGE HEALTHCARE FINALLY ADMITS IT PAID RANSOMWARE HACKERS‚ÄîAND
STILL FACES A PATIENT DATA LEAK (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 More than two months after a devastating ransomware attack,
healthcare firm Change Healthcare finally confirmed paying a ransom.
The payment of around $22 million in Bitcoin on March 1st was
previously identified by researchers but unacknowledged by Change
Healthcare. However, the company now warns that a "substantial
proportion" of Americans' sensitive medical data may still have been
stolen despite the ransom payment. 

 NESPRESSO DOMAIN SERVES UP STEAMY CUP OF PHISH, NO CREAM OR SUGAR (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A phishing campaign is exploiting a bug in Nespresso's website to
bypass detection by security tools that fail to identify malicious
nested or hidden links. The attack begins with a phishing email about
Microsoft sign-in activity. Clicking the link directs victims to a
legitimate but compromised Nespresso URL, which delivers a fake
Microsoft login page designed to steal credentials, all while evading
security warnings due to the use of the Nespresso address.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KOBOLD LETTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post from Lutra Security demonstrates an email phishing
technique called Kobold Letters. In this attack, an attacker makes use
of CSS selectors to make an email appear benign until it is forwarded,
at which point the phishing email appears. This occurs because the
HTML content is moved when the email is forwarded. Examples are
provided for various email clients. 

 THE END OF GITHUB PATS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Common GitHub workflows rely upon long-lived credentials such as PATs
or GitHub apps to interact with repos. To eliminate the possibility of
credentials leaking, Chainguard built an STS for GitHub which
exchanges short-term credentials for short-term credentials. The
architecture for the middleware is described in the post.
