ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RANSOMWARE GROUP CLAIMS HACKING OF OREGON REGULATOR AFTER DATA BREACH
DENIAL (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is investigating a
cyberattack that forced network shutdowns. Despite the agency
repeatedly stating it found no evidence of a data breach, the
ransomware group Rhysida claims to have stolen 2.5 TB of files,
demanding $2.5 million in bitcoin to prevent the auction of the
allegedly stolen data. 

 CRITICAL ERLANG/OTP SSH VULNERABILITY (CVSS 10.0) ALLOWS
UNAUTHENTICATED CODE EXECUTION (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-32433) in Erlang/OTP's SSH
implementation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code without
authentication. The flaw received a maximum CVSS score of 10.0.
Affecting all SSH servers using the Erlang/OTP SSH library, it enables
unauthenticated attackers to send protocol messages before
authentication. Users are advised to update ASAP. 

 MINISTER'S X ACCOUNT HACKED TO PROMOTE CRYPTO SCAM (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 The head of the UK's House of Commons Lucy Powell's X account was
hacked to promote a new scam cryptocurrency. The post described a new
community-driven digital currency known as $HCC. Analysts noted that
there had been only 34 transactions for the coin resulting in a profit
of around £225.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INVOKING MISCONFIGURED API GATEWAYS FROM ANY EXTERNAL AWS ACCOUNTS (6
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Private API Gateways in AWS are not internet accessible but are
accessible to anyone in the AWS networks. Users who don't realize this
can misconfigure the API Gateway with a Principal of ‘*' with the
intention of allowing access from any VPC in their account, but are
actually opening it to any VPC in AWS. This attack generally cannot be
exploited without some initial access or knowledge of the API Gateway
endpoint and REST API spec. 

 HOW I GOT HACKED: A WARNING ABOUT MALICIOUS POCS (11 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Security researcher Valentin Lobstein was infected with malware after
running an unverified CVE proof-of-concept that contained a hidden
script in a PDF file, which stole his credentials and installed a
Monero miner. The malware exfiltrated sensitive data, including SSH
keys, cloud credentials, and shell history, to a private Codeberg
repository using an API token. Lobstein subsequently exploited this
access to wipe the stolen data and disrupt the attacker's operations.
Despite his counterattack, the attacker had already synced some data
locally and may have used additional exfiltration channels, such as
file.io, demonstrating why security professionals should always
inspect code before execution, even when fatigued. 

 EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR LOCATION, PART 2: TRY IT YOURSELF AND SHARE THE
RESULTS (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post discusses a method for analyzing mobile app data sharing
and provides a Python notebook and guide to enable anyone to monitor
and investigate how apps share location and other personal data. The
author has created visualization tools showing how adtech companies
like Unity dominate mobile game traffic, with hundreds of data
requests happening within seconds of opening an app. The guide walks
readers through setting up mitmproxy to intercept mobile traffic,
recording app sessions, and analyzing the captured data to discover
what personal information is being shared with third parties.

 FLORIDA DRAFT LAW MANDATING ENCRYPTION BACKDOORS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA
ACCOUNTS BILLED ‘DANGEROUS AND DUMB' (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Florida's draft bill, which requires social media companies to
implement encryption backdoors for law enforcement, has advanced to
the Senate floor. The "Social Media Use by Minors" legislation would
also require parental access to children's accounts and prohibit the
use of disappearing messages for minors. Critics argue the bill would
compromise security and make users less safe. 

 MCP IS THE NEW INTERFACE FOR SECURITY TOOLS (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 MCP servers are the future of security as they can unify disparate
security tooling, handle the massive amounts of data used in security,
and enable security professionals who don't know how to code. MCP
servers offer a fully customized, single-pane-of-glass interface for
organizations. Authentication and auditing remain issues that need to
be implemented outside of the spec. 

 DPRK IT WORKERS IN OPEN SOURCE AND FREELANCE PLATFORMS (12 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 This document details a two-month investigation by cybersecurity
researchers who discovered North Korean IT workers infiltrating
legitimate open-source projects, particularly through the freelance
platform onlyDust. The researchers identified three leading actors
(0xExp-po, bestselection18/Hiroto Iwaki, and
aidenwong812/cryptogru812) who created elaborate false identities,
manipulated commit histories, and received payments totaling at least
$1,874 across 11 repositories while contributing 62 pull requests. The
investigation highlights serious security risks, including potential
supply chain attacks, as these DPRK IT workers often collaborate with
North Korean hacking teams to identify targets and establish initial
access for future attacks.

 HOUSE INVESTIGATION INTO DEEPSEEK TEASES OUT FUNDING, SECURITY
REALITIES AROUND CHINESE AI TOOL (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A House report warns that DeepSeek, a Chinese AI tool, poses national
security and economic risks to the U.S. due to its low cost, ties to
Chinese entities, and use for intelligence gathering on Americans, and
recommends stricter export controls and closer monitoring of emerging
AI technologies. 

 MICROSOFT: OFFICE 2016 AND OFFICE 2019 REACH END OF SUPPORT IN
