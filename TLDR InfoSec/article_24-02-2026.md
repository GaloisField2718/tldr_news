 AI ATTACKS MOVE AT MACHINE SPEED. YOUR SOC NEEDS INSIGHTS (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Attackers are using AI to automate lateral movement, mapping your
network in seconds and minutes instead of weeks. WHY
ARE YOUR ANALYSTS ARE STILL INVESTIGATING LOGS MANUALLY?

Illumio Insights [4] analyzes billions of connections in real-time to
show you the attack path, not just the alert: 

 	* Detect AI-driven lateral movement before it spreads across your
infrastructure. 
 	* Surface anomalous behavior patterns that are invisible to
traditional SIEMs. 
 	* See attack paths in their business context: “Dev server →
Prod database via RDP” not “172.16.4.5 → 192.168.1.87”. 
 	* Quarantine compromised hosts in one click while AI attacks are
still probing.

Microsoft chose Insights during Midnight Blizzard to hunt threats at
the speed of the attack.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS OF CVE-2025-29969 (13 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CVE-2025-29969 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the
MS-EVEN RPC protocol — enabled by default on Windows 11 and Windows
Server 2025 — that allows low-privileged users to write arbitrary
files remotely by exploiting a TOCTOU flaw in the EventLog backup
function, effectively bypassing default C$ share limitations. The
attack chain combines a hidden CreateFile primitive for remote
file/directory existence checks with an arbitrary write primitive
achieved by swapping an attacker-controlled EVTX file on a remote SMB
share between header validation and backup, enabling code execution
via Startup folder batch scripts or DLL hijacking. Microsoft patched
the TOCTOU write primitive in May 2025, though the recon capabilities
enabling remote file enumeration across domain-joined machines remain
unpatched. 

 JOOMLA! NOVARAIN/TASSOS FRAMEWORK VULNERABILITIES (7 MINUTE READ) [6]


 Three critical unauthenticated vulnerabilities — arbitrary file
read, arbitrary file deletion, and SQL injection — were disclosed in
the Novarain/Tassos Framework (v4.10.14–v6.0.37), a shared system
plugin shipped with five widely deployed Joomla! extensions including
Convert Forms, EngageBox, and Advanced Custom Fields. Chained
together, the flaws enable reliable RCE and administrator account
takeover by dumping active super admin sessions via SQLi, then
authenticating to upload malicious extensions. Administrators should
update affected extensions immediately or disable the
plg_system_nrframework plugin and restrict access to com_ajax
endpoints via WAF rules. 

 US HEALTHCARE DIAGNOSTIC FIRM SAYS 140,000 AFFECTED BY DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Everest ransomware actors accessed Vikor Scientific (now Vanta
Diagnostics) data via revenue cycle vendor Catalyst RCM, using
compromised credentials to steal about 12GB of files containing names,
dates of birth, payment card data, medical details, and insurance
information. Roughly 140,000 individuals are currently listed as
affected, but the final impact may be higher as counts from all linked
entities remain unclear.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LLMS IN THE KILL CHAIN: INSIDE A CUSTOM MCP TARGETING FORTIGATE
DEVICES ACROSS CONTINENTS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A misconfigured server exposed a full intrusion toolkit where a
threat actor integrated LLMs directly into the attack workflow —
using DeepSeek to generate attack plans from recon data and Claude
Code to conduct live vulnerability assessments — while targeting
FortiGate appliances across 106 countries with 2,516 identified
targets. Custom tools ARXON (an MCP server bridging LLM analysis with
attack scripts) and CHECKER2 (a Go-based Docker orchestrator)
automated the pipeline from stolen VPN config ingestion through
internal scanning to LLM-driven exploitation planning, evolving from
the open-source HexStrike framework in roughly eight weeks. Defenders
should audit for unauthorized VPN accounts, unexpected SSH access, and
unapproved firewall policy changes, as the dual-model approach of
selecting whichever LLM is most permissive for a given task lowers the
skill barrier for managing concurrent intrusions at scale. 

 YOUR SAMSUNG WEATHER APP IS A FINGERPRINT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Samsung's pre-installed Weather app quietly creates a highly unique
fingerprint from the combination of saved location IDs (placeid) it
sends to The Weather Company's API, with 96.4% of sampled devices
uniquely identifiable across days. These fingerprints persist over
time, survive IP and network changes, and can be resolved into precise
locations using hardcoded API keys that work from any client. Requests
often include both hashed placeid values and raw GPS coordinates,
giving IBM's Weather Company and Samsung rich, granular location
profiles that echo a broader industry pattern of monetizing
weather-based location data. 

 NOVEL TECHNIQUE TO DETECT CLOUD THREAT ACTOR OPERATIONS (20 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Unit 42 researchers introduced a novel detection method that
fingerprints cloud threat actors by linking their known MITRE ATT&CK
techniques to specific alert patterns. This approach successfully
distinguished Muddled Libra (Scattered Spider) and Silk Typhoon
operations across 22 industries from June 2024 to June 2025, with only
three shared alert signatures out of around 120, highlighting their
differing tactics. Industry alert spikes correlated with publicly
reported campaigns, such as a 25% rise in transportation sector alerts
during Muddled Libra's aviation attacks, enabling defenders to
identify threats early by investigating actor-related alerts over a
30-day window.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SIPER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Siper is a high-performance, XDP-based IP blacklist firewall built
with Go and eBPF that drops malicious traffic at the NIC driver level
before packets reach the kernel's networking stack. It supports
CIDR-based blocking via BPF LPM Trie maps, persistent JSON-based rule
management, and real-time drop/pass metrics. The minimalist
architecture separates a Go CLI control plane from the kernel-space
data plane, offering significantly lower CPU overhead than iptables or
nftables under heavy DDoS conditions. 

 TRIVYSUMMARY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 TrivySummary summarises Trivy scan JSON output for reporting
purposes. Package vulnerabilities are collapsed down to the respective
CVE, and headline counts of vulnerabilities at different priorities.
As well as the vendor severity and CVSS v3 score provided by Trivy,
EPSS scores can also be retrieved, allowing the exploitability and
severity of all vulnerabilities to be graphed and prioritised. 

 DEPTHFIRST (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Depthfirst is an AI security startup whose General Security
Intelligence platform scans and analyzes codebases and workflows to
detect issues, prevent credential exposure, and monitor open source
and third‑party components for AI‑driven threats.

 HACKERS HIDE PULSAR RAT INSIDE PNG IMAGES IN NEW NPM SUPPLY CHAIN
ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Veracode researchers discovered a typosquatted NPM package called
"buildrunner-dev" that delivers the Pulsar RAT by hiding malicious
code within PNG images using steganography, extracting payloads from
RGB pixel values at runtime. The attack chain employs a heavily
obfuscated 1,600-line batch file with only 21 functional lines,
detects and evades AV products like ESET and Malwarebytes, and uses
process hollowing to inject the final payload into legitimate
processes. Developers should carefully verify package names and audit
dependencies, as supply chain attacks increasingly leverage
image-based steganography to bypass traditional file-scanning tools. 

 PAYPAL NOTIFIES CUSTOMERS OF DATA BREACH THAT EXPOSED SSNS AND MORE
FOR NEARLY 6 MONTHS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 PayPal disclosed a software error in its Working Capital loan app
that exposed the names, contact details, SSNs, and dates of birth of
100 business customers between July and mid-December 2025. The company
reversed the faulty code, reset passwords, and detected some
unauthorized transactions. 

 INFOSEC COMMUNITY PANICS AS ANTHROPIC ROLLS OUT CLAUDE CODE SECURITY
CHECKER (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's new Claude Code Security feature scans codebases for
vulnerabilities, proposes patches, and claims to have surfaced
hundreds of high‑severity issues in open source projects, spooking
security investors and pushing stocks like CrowdStrike down. It joins
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI in deploying AI agents for bug
hunting, but all still require human review and face questions over
false positives, costs, and marketing hype.
