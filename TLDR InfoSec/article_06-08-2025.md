ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS EXPOSED IN LOUISIANA SHERIFF'S OFFICE HACK (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Medusa ransomware gang reportedly stole over 90GB of data from
the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office in 2024. A sample of the data
includes sensitive information on confidential informants, including
names, dates of birth, and SSNs. The breach also included data on
seized devices, surveillance operations, sock puppet accounts,
polygraph results, and internal affairs. 

 SONICWALL INVESTIGATES 'CYBER INCIDENTS,' INCLUDING RANSOMWARE
TARGETING SUSPECTED 0-DAY (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SonicWall is probing recent ransomware attacks on its Gen 7
firewalls, potentially exploiting a zero-day in SSL VPNs. Even with
MFA enabled, attackers bypassed controls, deployed ransomware, and
quickly pivoted to internal systems. SonicWall has urged customers to
disable SSL VPN and use mitigation steps ASAP while waiting for
official patches. 

 HACKER USED A VOICE PHISHING ATTACK TO STEAL CISCO CUSTOMERS'
PERSONAL INFORMATION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacker used a voice phishing (“vishing”) call to trick a Cisco
representative, gaining access to their third-party CRM system and
stealing Cisco.com users' personal data: names, organizations,
addresses, emails, phone numbers, and more. The company did not
disclose how many users this sophisticated social engineering breach
affected.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INVERSEPROMPT: TURNING CLAUDE AGAINST ITSELF, ONE PROMPT AT A TIME
(­­­CVE-2025-54794 & CVE-2025-54795) (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Elad Beber discovered two high-severity vulnerabilities in
Anthropic's Claude Code during its Research Preview phase.
CVE-2025-54794 (CVSS 7.7) allows path restrictions to be bypassed
through naive prefix validation, enabling access to files outside the
intended working directory. CVE-2025-54795 (CVSS 8.7) enables command
injection via inadequate input sanitization, allowing arbitrary code
execution without user confirmation by breaking out of allowed
commands like “echo”. Anthropic has patched both vulnerabilities. 

 FROM THE TOP 20 OPEN SOURCE COMPONENT VULNERABILITIES: RETHINKING THE
CHALLENGES OF OPEN SOURCE SECURITY GOVERNANCE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Open source security governance is challenged by widespread reliance
on vulnerable libraries, lack of standardized management, insecure
defaults, and unclear ownership. This post dives into how effective
governance requires proactive policies, measurable capabilities, and
continuous attention beyond just tool-based vulnerability scans to
deal with known and unknown risks in dependencies. 

 EXPLOITING ZERO DAYS IN ABANDONED HARDWARE (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Trail of Bits researchers exploited two discontinued home network
devices (Netgear WGR614v9 router and BitDefender Box V1) at
DistrictCon's Junkyard competition, achieving remote root access
through chained vulnerabilities, including UPnP authentication bypass,
buffer overflows, and firmware downgrade attacks. The research
highlights how end-of-life hardware becomes a persistent security risk
when manufacturers stop releasing updates, leaving vulnerabilities
permanently unpatched. Both devices were initially designed to protect
home networks, but became easy targets due to years without security
updates.

 AI SITE PERPLEXITY USES “STEALTH TACTICS” TO FLOUT NO-CRAWL
EDICTS (2 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 A recent report from Cloudflare stated that Perplexity is
deliberately circumventing robots.txt and utilizing evasion techniques
to avoid web application blocks. The researchers identified that when
Perplexity's crawlers encounter Cloudflare's blocks or a robots.txt
file, they cycle through a list of IPs not in Perplexity's published
IP ranges and shuffle ASNs to avoid blocks. Other sites such as
Forbes, Reddit, and Wired have also leveled similar accusations at
Perplexity. 

 JURY “SENDS A MESSAGE” ON APP PRIVACY IN RULING AGAINST META (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A jury found Meta guilty of illegally invading the privacy of women
who shared their health data with the period tracking app Flo by
deliberately harvesting it without consent. This verdict may set a
landmark precedent in setting boundaries for how far tech firms can go
in collecting personal data for use in targeted advertising. Meta has
denied any wrongdoing and is “exploring all legal options.” 

 SONATYPE UNCOVERS GLOBAL ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN IN OPEN SOURCE ECOSYSTEMS
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sonatype uncovered a global espionage campaign led by North Korea's
Lazarus Group that uses malware-laced open source packages on npm and
PyPI to infiltrate developer environments. Over 234 malicious packages
targeted at least 36,000 victims, aiming to steal secrets and open
persistent backdoors across critical digital infrastructure.
