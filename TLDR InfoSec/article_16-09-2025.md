ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW VOIDPROXY PHISHING SERVICE BYPASSES MFA ON MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE
ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 VoidProxy is a new Phishing-as-a-Service platform that uses
Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks to bypass multi-factor authentication
on Microsoft and Google accounts by intercepting login credentials and
session cookies in real-time. The platform leverages compromised email
accounts from legitimate providers like Constant Contact to evade spam
filters, then redirects victims to perfect clones of login pages where
all authentication data is stolen. VoidProxy operates with a
sophisticated two-part infrastructure that features disposable
front-ends and resilient back-ends, along with anti-analysis features
including Cloudflare CAPTCHA protection, making it difficult for
security teams to detect and track. 

 ETERNAL-TUX: CRAFTING A LINUX KERNEL KSMBD 0-CLICK RCE EXPLOIT FROM
N-DAYS (18 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A stable authenticated 0-click remote code execution exploit against
Linux's kernel SMB3 daemon (ksmbd) chains two existing CVEs:
CVE-2023-52440 for controlled heap overflow, and CVE-2023-4130 for
memory leakage, targeting Linux 6.1.45 with full mitigations enabled.
The exploit leverages NTLM authentication flaws to overflow a 512-byte
SLUB allocation, then uses an arbitrary free primitive to corrupt a
1KB ksmbd_conn object and hijack a vtable pointer to achieve ROP-based
code execution via call_usermodehelper. The technique demonstrates how
N-day vulnerabilities can be chained together for reliable
exploitation despite modern kernel protections, though it requires
authenticated SMB access and is limited by the relative rarity of
ksmbd deployments in production environments. 

 INSIDER BLAMED FOR FINWISE DATA BREACH AFFECTING NEARLY 700K (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Nearly 700,000 FinWise Bank customers are being notified after a
former employee may have accessed or taken personal data
post-employment. The breach, detected over a year after it happened,
involved customers from American First Finance. FinWise is offering
affected individuals free credit monitoring. The case highlights
ongoing risks posed by insider threats within financial and tech
organizations.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OLD BUT GOLD, DUMPING LSASS WITH WINDOWS ERROR REPORTING ON MODERN
WINDOWS 11 (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A red team researcher demonstrated how to bypass LSASS memory
protections on Windows 11 by exploiting a vulnerable version of
WerFaultSecure.exe from Windows 8.1, which runs with the highest
Protected Process Light (PPL) level and can access protected LSASS
memory that normal processes cannot touch. The technique uses
undocumented parameters to trigger unencrypted crash dumps of the
LSASS process, then disguises the output file with PNG magic headers
to evade antivirus detection. The attack requires deploying the older
vulnerable WerFaultSecure.exe binary alongside a custom loader that
launches the tool with proper PPL protections, demonstrating how
legacy Windows components can be weaponized against modern security
controls. 

 HACKING THE XBOX 360 HYPERVISOR PART 1: SYSTEM OVERVIEW (18 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This is the first part of a three-part series on hacking the Xbox 360
hypervisor. It provides a comprehensive system overview of the
console's security architecture, including the custom Xenon PowerPC
CPU with on-die security features like 768 eFuses, 64KB secure RAM,
hardware encryption, and protected memory pathways that use per-boot
encryption keys and CRC checksums. The hypervisor operates as a 256KB
protected process that manages all executable memory allocation and
code authentication, with only one known exploit in its history - the
"4548 system call handler bug," which was likely caused by a compiler
optimization error rather than intentional code changes. In the
console's robust security model, where Microsoft must sign all code,
hypervisor memory is protected with both encryption and integrity
checks. The system uses multiple privilege levels with strict
validation to prevent software-only hacks. 

 PLAYING WITH HTTP/2 CONNECT (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 HTTP/2 CONNECT is an upgrade over the original HTTP/1 CONNECT method,
shifting from tunneling entire TCP connections to multiplexing
multiple streams within a single connection. This evolution enables
more efficient proxying and port scanning by allowing numerous tunnels
without the overhead of opening many separate TCP sessions. The
protocol's design incorporates features like HPACK header compression
and support for modern proxy use cases—including WebSocket, UDP, and
raw IP proxying—making it highly relevant for security research and
next-generation proxy infrastructure.

 RAW DISK PARSER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Raw Disk Parser is a proof-of-concept Python script that dumps
sensitive or restricted files without triggering alerts. It works by
reading directly from the disk, then analyzing NTFS filesystem
structures to find and read files. This method doesn't use standard
Windows file APIs, so it effectively bypasses file access controls,
locks, and some EDR/AV monitoring features that rely on hooking
high-level file I/O operations.

 SCATTERED SPIDER RANSOMWARE GROUP ABRUPTLY DECIDES TO END OPERATIONS
- FOR NOW, AT LEAST (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Fifteen major ransomware gangs, including Scattered Spider, Lapsus,
and Shiny Hunters, announced they are "going dark" after claiming they
fulfilled their goals and will enjoy their earnings from recent
attacks on companies like Jaguar Land Rover, Marks & Spencer, and
Salesforce. They posted their farewell on BreachForums, saying they
will stop attacking in their name. However, experts doubt this will be
permanent, as some members have already been arrested, and the profits
of cybercrime may lure them back. The announcement follows a summer
campaign where the rebranded "Scattered Lapsus Hunters" targeted over
700 organizations worldwide, mainly through social engineering and
data theft rather than ransomware. 

 FBI WARNS OF UNC6040, UNC6395 HACKERS STEALING SALESFORCE DATA (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 The FBI issued a FLASH alert about cybercriminal groups UNC6040 and
UNC6395, which target Salesforce to steal data and extort through
methods like voice phishing and OAuth token exploitation. UNC6040 has
used social engineering since late 2024 to trick call center staff
into connecting malicious apps to Salesforce, while UNC6395 exploited
OAuth tokens in August to access customer data and credentials. Major
companies such as Google, Adidas, Qantas, Cisco, Louis Vuitton, and
Tiffany & Co. have been impacted. The threat actors are linked to
ShinyHunters and Scattered Spider, who recently announced they are
"going dark." 

 PROTON MAIL TAKES ACTION: JOURNALIST ACCOUNTS SUSPENDED FOLLOWING
CYBERSECURITY AGENCY REQUEST (5 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Proton Mail suspended two journalists' accounts after they published
research documenting an intrusion into several South Korean government
institutions in Phrack. It contacted the researchers via the
disclosure account a week after the print release, notifying them that
their account was being suspended, citing a policy violation due to a
government cybersecurity organization. The company reversed its
decision and restored the accounts following a public outcry over
privacy.
