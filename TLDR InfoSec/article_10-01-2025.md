STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HIDING LINUX PROCESSES WITH BIND MOUNTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post refines a methodology for hiding Linux processes by using a
bind mount to mount a different directory on top of /proc/PID for the
malicious process. The author was looking to refine the original
methodology by creating a more realistic directory to overlay but
realized that they could instead overlay the proc directory of a
spontaneous process which is usually ignored by sysadmins. They note
that this method would still be easy to detect if you are aware of the
technique and provide a command to do so. 

 IMPLEMENTING SECURITY INVARIANTS IN AN AWS MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Permission Boundary defines the maximum permissions that can be
applied to a given principal. In an AWS management account,
permissions boundaries are necessary because SCPs cannot be applied.
This post introduces a set of security invariants that should be true
in an AWS management account and provides an IAM policy to enforce
them. It also links to a Lambda function that can be used to attach
the policy to all newly created IAM principals. 

 HERE'S HOW HUCKSTERS ARE MANIPULATING GOOGLE TO PROMOTE SHADY CHROME

 Google Chrome's Web Store policy prohibits developers from
manipulating extension search results, yet hundreds violate this rule.
Developers exploit language translation features to hide thousands of
misleading keywords in alternative language descriptions, affecting
search results and promoting unrelated or potentially abusive
extensions.

 SCHEMING REASONING EVALUATIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apollo Research tested 6 popular LLMs to determine how they would
react when given a prompt that gave them a goal, instructed them to
achieve their goal at all costs, and then gave them a task to review
files that contain proof that the developers have a different goal. 5
out of the 6 models tested would attempt to circumvent hurdles or
safeguards to their goals and in some cases, models would lie about
the actions on consultations. The researchers found that some models
could deliberately underperform or otherwise scheme to attempt to
achieve their goals.
