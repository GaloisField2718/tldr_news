 LISTEN TO THE WHISPERS: WEB TIMING ATTACKS THAT ACTUALLY WORK (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 James Kettle presented at DEFCON on how he exploited timing attacks
with delays as low as 200 microseconds. To reduce noise, Kettle
utilized HTTP/2 to send multiple requests that arrived at the same
time and interleaved a ping packet to force HTTP header coalescing,
trying to hit slow code paths. He was able to effectively demonstrate
the efficacy of this technique in discovering hidden parameters,
server-side injections, and reverse-proxy misconfigurations.
