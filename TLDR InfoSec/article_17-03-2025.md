 The "ClickFix" scheme tricks users into downloading password-stealing
malware disguised as CAPTCHA verification. Users press Windows+R,
CTRL+V, and Enter, which activates the download through mshta.exe.
Organizations can prevent this by disabling the run command for the
Windows+R shortcut.

 GITHUB ACTION TJ-ACTIONS/CHANGED-FILES SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK:
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action repository was compromised
by an attacker posing as the Renovate bot. The attacker added a
malicious payload that caused the CI runner to dump its memory into
the Actions work log and redirected all tags to include this payload.
Sensitive data in GitHub secrets for this action can be visible in
public repos, but the impact on private repositories is more limited.
