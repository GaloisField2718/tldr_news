ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PROMPT INJECTION INSIDE GITHUB ACTIONS: THE NEW FRONTIER OF SUPPLY
CHAIN ATTACKS (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 PromptPwnd is a new vulnerability class that affects GitHub Actions
and GitLab CI/CD pipelines that use AI agents like Gemini CLI, Claude
Code, and OpenAI Codex. In this vulnerability, untrusted user input
from issues, pull requests, or commit messages is injected into
prompts, leading to the execution of privileged tools. The attack
allows secret exfiltration by tricking AI agents into leaking
GITHUB_TOKEN or cloud credentials through shell commands such as gh
issue edit. Google's Gemini CLI repository was confirmed vulnerable
before the patch. To mitigate this, organizations should restrict AI
toolsets, avoid injecting untrusted input into prompts, treat AI
output as untrusted code, and limit GitHub token permissions by IP. 

 PORNHUB EXTORTED AFTER HACKERS STEAL PREMIUM MEMBER ACTIVITY DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The ShinyHunters extortion gang is extorting the adult video platform
PornHub after stealing over 200M records of personal information in
the Mixpanel breach. The breached data includes email address,
activity type, location, video URL, video name, keywords associated
with the video, and the time the event occurred. PornHub stated that
they have not worked with Mixpanel since 2021, so the stolen records
are historical analytics data from 2021 or earlier. 

 700,000 RECORDS COMPROMISED IN ASKUL RANSOMWARE ATTACK (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Japanese e-commerce and logistics firm Askul suffered a ransomware
attack by the RansomHouse group, which exfiltrated data and encrypted
its systems, severely disrupting ordering, shipping, and automated
logistics operations. Attackers used the compromised credentials to
delete backups and deploy file-encrypting malware, exposing over
700,000 records across customers, partners, employees, and executives.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A BROWSER EXTENSION RISK GUIDE AFTER THE SHADYPANDA CAMPAIGN (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The ShadyPanda campaign compromised popular Chrome and Edge
extensions after seven years of building trust, affecting 4.3 million
users, and installed full RCE frameworks that could steal session
tokens and hijack SaaS accounts, bypassing MFA. The attack
demonstrated that browser extensions represent a critical blind spot
between endpoint and cloud security, with silent auto-updates enabling
overnight weaponization. Organizations should implement extension
allow lists, treat extension permissions as OAuth access grants,
conduct regular permission audits, and monitor for behavioral changes
that indicate compromise. 

 WHAT DATA DO CODING AGENTS SEND, AND WHERE TO? (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 As AI coding agents become more common, security teams should
understand what data these tools collect and where it goes. Chaser
Systems created a test environment with seven coding agents, testing
actions such as starting the agent, tab autocomplete, creating new
features, committing and pushing to a git repository, running tests,
and uploading data to 0x0.st. They also checked access to AWS
credentials and files outside the project directory. The article
describes the domains contacted, sample requests, and data transfer
volumes during tests conducted with telemetry both disabled and
enabled, including scenarios where telemetry is enabled, but FQDNs are
blocked. 

 JUMPSHOT: XM CYBER UNCOVERS CRITICAL LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
(CVE-2025-34352) IN JUMPCLOUD AGENT (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A critical flaw was found in the JumpCloud Remote Assist for Windows
agent that lets any low-privileged user on a machine gain full
SYSTEM-level control or crash the system entirely. The issue stems
from the agent's uninstaller performing file creation, deletion, and
execution in the user's %TEMP% directory, which an attacker can
redirect using symbolic links and mount points to target protected
system files. This enables both denial-of-service via driver
corruption and full local privilege escalation through a race
condition involving Windows Installer files, making rapid patching to
version 0.317.0 or later essential for organizations using
JumpCloud-managed Windows endpoints.

 ANNOUNCING XINT CODE (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Theori's Xint Code, an AI-powered code analysis tool, discovered
critical 0-day RCE vulnerabilities in Redis, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB
with zero human intervention at ZeroDay Cloud, sweeping the database
category and outperforming all human teams. The tool analyzes source
code, configuration files, and binaries without packaging or
harnessing requirements, producing actionable reports with
dramatically fewer false positives than traditional static analysis
while identifying vulnerabilities missed by humans for decades. Theori
is seeking early partners to validate findings on real codebases
before broader rollout.

 sq is a CLI that provides jq-style access to structured data sources
such as SQL databases or document formats like CSV or Excel. 

 ECHO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 Echo uses AI agents to create and maintain vulnerability-free Docker
base images by stripping non-essential components, reducing attack
surface, and continuously patching newly discovered flaws. These
CVE-free images drop into existing workflows by changing a single
Dockerfile line, instantly lowering container vulnerability counts.

 SVG FILTERS - CLICKJACKING 2.0 (20 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A novel clickjacking technique leverages SVG filters applied to
cross-origin iframes to read pixel colors, hide or manipulate UI
elements, and execute logic gates for complex multi-step attacks
without JavaScript. The technique enables data exfiltration through
fake captchas, dynamic attack overlays that respond to iframe state
changes, and even QR code generation to encode stolen data for mobile
exfiltration. Security teams should note that traditional
X-Frame-Options and CSP frame-ancestors remain the primary defenses,
as this attack only works against frameable pages. 

 NO, SOUNDCLOUD HASN'T STARTED TUNING OUT VPNS. IT'S MOPPING UP AFTER
A CYBERATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 SoundCloud detected unauthorized access to an internal dashboard,
triggering incident response and outside forensics support. Attackers
accessed email addresses and public-profile data for roughly 20
percent of users, but no passwords or financial information. The
company also faced web-only DDoS attacks, and later configuration
changes accidentally disrupted some VPN users, sparking false rumors
that SoundCloud was banning VPN access. 

 SANTASTEALER IS COMING TO TOWN: A NEW, AMBITIOUS INFOSTEALER
ADVERTISED ON UNDERGROUND FORUMS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 SantaStealer is a new malware-as-a-service info‑stealer advertised
in Telegram channels and forums that can exfiltrate documents,
credentials, crypto wallets, and other sensitive data from numerous
applications. It uses a modular, multi-threaded design that runs
mostly in memory. The software gathers data from browsers, messaging
apps, and gaming platforms, zips everything, splits it into 10 MB
chunks, and sends it over unencrypted HTTP to attacker-controlled
servers.
