ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRYPTO EXCHANGE BYBIT SAYS IT WAS HACKED AND LOST AROUND $1.4B (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Crypto exchange Bybit has suffered a major hack, losing approximately
$1.4 billion worth of Ethereum from a multisig wallet. CEO Ben Zhou
confirmed the breach, which represents the largest crypto theft in
history and potentially the largest single theft ever. 

 SPYLEND ANDROID MALWARE DOWNLOADED 100K TIMES FROM GOOGLE PLAY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SpyLend is a malicious app masquerading as a finance app called
Finance Simplified on the Google Play store. The app evaded detection
by running a WebView which instructed users to download an APK for a
loan app if the user was in India. It collected a large amount of data
and used it to extort users to accept high interest rate loans. 

 FAKE CS2 TOURNAMENT STREAMS USED TO STEAL CRYPTO, STEAM ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat actors have been abusing major Counter Strike 2 tournaments to
steal Steam accounts and crypto via stream jacking. They are
impersonating professional CS2 players on live streams and promoting
fake skin and cryptocurrency giveaways. The attackers use hacked
YouTube accounts with looped footage of past streams to trick viewers
to scan QR codes or send them crypto.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 48 MINUTES: HOW FAST PHISHING ATTACKS EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A manufacturing company suffered a sophisticated cyberattack where
threat actors used a spam email flood as a decoy to contact employees
via Teams, posing as IT support. Using Windows Quick Assist, they
gained access and achieved network infiltration in just 48 minutes,
much faster than typical attacks. This blog dives into how this became
possible. 

 VULNWATCH: AI-ENHANCED PRIORITIZATION OF VULNERABILITIES (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This blog post describes the Vulnwatch tool from Databricks, an
AI-powered system that automatically identifies and prioritizes
vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, achieving 85% accuracy in
identifying business-critical CVEs while reducing manual security team
workload by 95%. The system combines multiple scoring methods
including severity score (based on CVSS, EPSS, and community impact),
component score (measuring library criticality to Databricks
services), and topic score (using LDA to cluster libraries by service
context). Using fine-tuned LLMs and vector similarity matching, the
system can identify vulnerable dependencies on day zero, enabling the
security team to focus only on the most critical 5% of vulnerabilities
rather than sifting through hundreds of daily CVE publications. 

 ANALYZING SECURE AI ARCHITECTURES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI vulnerabilities shift the traditional patching paradigm from
patching individual vulnerabilities to a data modeling problem. This
post from NCC Group explores the Gatekeeper and State Machine
architectural pattern for securing the data that enters and exits an
AI system. Each architecture includes an explanation of the
architecture and examples of how it can be applied.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BFOREAI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [10] 

 BforeAI uses predictive attack intelligence technology to create a
list of domains that are likely to be used for malicious purposes in
the future instead of leveraging blocklists consisting of domains that
have already been seen in attacks. 

 SHAREM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SHAREM is a shell code analysis framework that is capable of
emulating more than 20K WinAPIs and virtually all Windows syscalls. 

 OSX-PROXMOX (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 OSX-PROXMOX allows you to install OSX (aka Hackintosh) on any
computer. The README describes the various steps one can take and even
claims to be able to install on a cloud VM.

 APPLE PULLS ENCRYPTION FEATURE FROM UK OVER GOVERNMENT SPYING DEMANDS
(5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Apple has discontinued Advanced Data Protection (ADP), its end-to-end
encrypted iCloud storage service, for new UK users and will require
existing users to disable it. This follows reports of UK security
services requesting backdoor access to encrypted backups. 

 THREE QUESTIONS ABOUT APPLE, ENCRYPTION, AND THE U.K. (7 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Cryptographer Matthew Green discusses the backdoor request that the
UK government made from Apple and Apple's subsequent decision to
disable their encrypted cloud backup feature. He discusses three
different points around how seriously Apple has taken encryption for
customers, the exact asks from the UK government as well as the
ramifications, and how Apple might respond. Green ends on a note that
the exit makes the UK Government's request for backdoor moot, but it's
unclear what will happen to users who already had Advanced Data
Protection enabled, whether they would retain the encryption or be
forced to downgrade. 

 BRING YOUR OWN TRUSTED BINARY (BYOTB) – BSIDES EDITION (8 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 In this transcript of a talk that David Kennedy gave at BSides London
2024, Kennedy breaks down how existing binaries like Cloudflared and
SSH can be used for tunneling and port forwarding in network security
scenarios. He notes that the initial example relies on SSH existing on
the system and also discusses how the binary can be copied into a
Windows system easily. Kennedy also explores defensive measures such
as monitoring for specific command line switches and DNS logging to
detect potential attacks involving these binaries.
