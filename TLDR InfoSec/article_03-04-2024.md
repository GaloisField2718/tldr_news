 MALICIOUS XZ BACKDOOR REVEALS FRAGILITY OF OPEN SOURCE (7 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 The backdoor in the widely-used open-source xz compression library
could have led to a significant security disaster had it not been
fortuitously detected by a curious Microsoft engineer investigating
latency issues. This near-miss scenario has raised alarms about the
potential for similar undetected compromises in software
infrastructure. This post analyzes the current state of open source
software. 

 USING TAILSCALE FOR PERSISTENCE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post details a method that uses Tailscale to establish a C2 on a
Kubernetes node. In this scenario, an attacker has obtained time
limited cluster-admin credentials and wants to utilize those
credentials to establish persistence. The described attack involves
deploying Tailscale on the node via containerd or a static manifest
and utilizing Tailscale ACLs to only allow communication from C2
controller nodes to the infected bot nodes.
