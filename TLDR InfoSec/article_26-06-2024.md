STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PROJECT NAPTIME: EVALUATING OFFENSIVE SECURITY CAPABILITIES OF LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS (21 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This project from Google's Project Zero explores how large language
models (LLMs) can improve vulnerability discovery in cybersecurity
testing by up to 20x in the CyberSecEval 2 benchmark. The researchers
developed a framework called Naptime that significantly enhances LLM
performance in identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities. Naptime
automates variant analysis and closely mimics the approach of human
security experts by incorporating specialized tools and principles. 

 AWS WITHOUT ACCESS KEYS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Fly.io operates a custom OIDC IdP that allows apps running in Fly
Machines to access AWS services without a user needing to directly
interact with AWS. Fly utilizes a custom init server that fly machines
boot into, which exposes a Unix socket to access the Fly Machine API
that contains the OIDC information. Fly then detects if an
AWS_ROLE_ARN is set and if so, generates an OIDC token, saves it to a
file, and sets the appropriate environment variables for the AWS SDK.

 This blog post explains how to reverse engineer eBPF programs by
