 THE SECURITY LEADER'S GUIDE TO PROACTIVE VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Cyber threats are inter-connected. Vulnerabilities are gateways in
your attack surface that can be exploited to deploy ransomware,
infostealers, and other cyber threats.

Learn how you can build a strong vulnerability management program
(VMP) [4] and reduce your attack surface with this comprehensive
guide, featuring:

→ Roadmaps, battle-tested lessons learned, and strategies
implemented by Flashpoint customers.

→ Measuring your VMP's effectiveness [4] with metrics like Mean Time
to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR).

→ How to manage risk exposure by combining powerful vulnerability
intelligence with industry-leading threat intelligence.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ADMINS BETTER SPRING INTO ACTION OVER LATEST CRITICAL OPEN SOURCE
VULN (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CVE-2024-38821 is a new critical vulnerability that affects Spring
WebFlux applications with specific configurations. While rated 9.1
CVSS by Spring, Red Hat considers it moderate (7.4) due to limited
scope. It only impacts apps using WebFlux with static resources and
non-permitAll authorization rules. 

 CHATGPT JAILBREAK: RESEARCHERS BYPASS AI SAFEGUARDS USING HEXADECIMAL
ENCODING AND EMOJIS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT's safety controls can be bypassed using malicious
instructions encoded in hexadecimal format. The vulnerability was
disclosed through Mozilla's 0Din bug bounty program. It represents
another example of prompt injection bypassing AI safeguards. 

 FREE, FRANCE'S SECOND LARGEST ISP, CONFIRMS DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [7]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT MAKES A “GOOD” DETECTION? (19 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Shannon Signal Score is a way to combine qualitative and
quantitative metrics to evaluate the quality of a signal based on the
organization's context and the specifics of the threat. It combines
qualitative and quantitative metrics to evaluate signal quality by
considering threat alignment, detection integrity, operational costs,
impact potential, and utility. The score uses weighted components
including Threat Alignment and Coverage (measuring detection's threat
alignment and attack surface coverage), Detection Integrity
(quantifying effectiveness), Operational Cost (maintenance and false
positive overhead), Impact and Risk Potential (threat impact
assessment), and Utility (organizational value). 

 STRENGTHENING LOCAL ADMIN SECURITY IN WINDOWS 11 WITH LOCAL ADMIN
PROTECTION (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 When using a local admin account in Windows, users are provided with
both a limited user token and an elevated admin token which can
potentially be stolen by malware on the system. Windows 11 recently
introduced the Local Admin Protection or ShadowAdmin protection to
solve this issue. In this system, a ShadowAdmin account is created for
each local admin account, and when a process needs admin privileges,
the task is run in an isolated context by the ShadowAdmin user. This
post includes instructions to enable the feature and detailed
technical details of how the Local Admin Protection flow works. 

 REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE FOR CONFIDENTIAL DATA PROCESSING IN A TRUSTED
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) architectures are designed to
ensure privacy, security, and transparency for personal data
processing. TEE solutions use hardware isolation, data encryption, and
privacy policies to protect sensitive information. Different use
cases, such as data minimization and data aggregation, can benefit
from TEE-based solutions.
