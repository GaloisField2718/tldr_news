STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURITY FIRST: DEVSECOPS EMPOWERMENT WITH TERRASCAN (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Terrascan is an IaC scanner by Tenable that can be used to scan
Terraform files, Helm Charts, Dockerfiles, and other IaC files. This
post walks through the steps to install Terrascan and run it against
Terraform files. It provides the full output of the sample run and

 SECURE YOUR TAILSCALE INFRASTRUCTURE FURTHER WITH MUTUAL TLS (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Viktor Petersson, co-founder of Screenly, walks through the process
of utilizing certificates generated by Tailscale for Mutual TLS to
provide an added layer of security to sensitive applications or those
that don't require authentication. Petersson first generates a client
certificate with Tailscale and exports it to a PKCS#12 bundle, then he
imports that to a browser, and finally deploys a ghostunnel server to
reverse proxy traffic on the server. 

 WHY SAST + DAST CAN'T BE ENOUGH (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Static and dynamic app testing are important but not enough to fully
secure modern software. New automated testing procedures are needed to
address evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Detection in source code
is crucial for enhancing application security beyond traditional
methods.
