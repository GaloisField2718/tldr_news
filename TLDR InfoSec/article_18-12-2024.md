ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HUNK COMPANION WORDPRESS PLUGIN EXPLOITED TO INSTALL VULNERABLE
PLUGINS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Researchers from WPScan have discovered a remote code execution
vulnerability in the WordPress plugin Hunk Companion. Hunk Companion
is used to complement the features provided by ThemeHunk which is a
plugin designed to install new themes. The vulnerability allows for
the installation of plugins via an unauthenticated POST request.
Attackers have been actively exploiting this vulnerability to install
PHP droppers which allow for maintaining persistent access. 

 EYECARE & HEALTHTECH COMPANY EXPOSED ALMOST 5 MILLION RECORDS (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Jeremiah Fowler discovered an unencrypted, non-password protected
database containing 4.8 million records belonging to AI optometry
software company Care1. The database contained eye exams in PDF format
which included patient PII, doctor's comments, and images of the exam
results. The database also included spreadsheets that contained
patient addresses, personal health numbers, and other PHI. Care1
removed the database after it was notified of the exposure. 

 CONNECTONCALL DATA BREACH IMPACTED OVER 900,000 INDIVIDUALS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 ConnectOnCall, a telehealth platform, experienced a data breach that
affected over 900,000 individuals. The breach exposed personal and
medical information, prompting the company to take swift action and
offer identity and credit monitoring services to affected individuals.
ConnectOnCall is working with cybersecurity experts and law
enforcement to address the security incident.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF AN EGG-CELLENT RESUME (20 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 An in-depth look at a sophisticated campaign conducted by TA4557/FIN6
that utilized a resume lure to compromise a system. The fake resume
zip contained a malicious .lnk file which was used to start an
execution flow with several LOLBins payloads to establish a foothold.
The threat actor then established persistence by deploying C2 software
and creating a new user before performing recon to discover a target
for lateral movement. The threat actor then compromised and pivoted to
a Veeam backup server which they used to compromise another server.
The attacker then utilized Cloudflared and Cobalt Strike for
persistence but didn't perform any more actions before being evicted. 

 THE QUALCOMM DSP DRIVER - UNEXPECTEDLY EXCAVATING AN EXPLOIT (32
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This technical analysis examines several vulnerabilities discovered
in Qualcomm's adsprpc driver, which Google's Threat Analysis Group
found was being exploited in the wild. The researchers identified six
different bugs, including CVE-2024-43047, which involved a
use-after-free vulnerability that could be triggered through map
collisions in the driver's memory management system. By analyzing
kernel panic logs from the exploit, the researchers determined that
attackers were likely using inotify_event_info objects to exploit the
vulnerability, highlighting how chipset drivers remain one of the
weakest links in Android's security model in 2024. 

 PERFORMING ANDROID STATIC ANALYSIS 101-A COMPLETE GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS
(8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This is a comprehensive guide to Android Static Analysis, which is a
method of examining Android applications for security vulnerabilities
without executing them. It covers several essential tools including
APKTool, MobSF, Dex2jar, JD-GUI, Androguard, Ghidra, and APKleaks,
explaining how each tool can be installed and used to analyze
different aspects of Android applications such as permissions,
hardcoded credentials, and potential security risks. The tools work
together to create a robust security analysis approach, with each tool
offering unique capabilities - from decompiling APKs to inspecting
code and identifying vulnerabilities in the early stages of
development.

 MICROSOFT RECALL SCREENSHOTS CREDIT CARD NUMBERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY
NUMBERS (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The author of this post was investigating the efficacy of Microsoft
Recall's “sensitive information” filter, which comes enabled by
default in the current Windows Insider build, and found that it still
captured credit card information and SSNs. The researcher tested
entering credit card numbers into a Notepad file with clear text
delineating it as a credit card number, filled out a PDF of a loan
application in Microsoft Edge that included an SSN and other personal
information, and even created an HTML page that had a text input
explicitly requesting credit card information and found that Recall
copied all of them. Recall did omit capturing information inputted in
actual shopping sites though. 

 KALI LINUX 2024.4 RELEASED (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kali Linux 2024.4 has been released as the last release of the year.
This release adds 14 new tools, GNOME 47 on the desktop release, a new
default Python version, and increased support for the Raspberry Pi
imager. The release also ends support for i386 images, disallows the
installation of pip packages by default, and deprecates SSH DSA keys. 

 COMPROMISING OPENWRT SUPPLY CHAIN VIA TRUNCATED SHA-256 COLLISION AND
COMMAND INJECTION (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The blog post discusses a security vulnerability in the OpenWrt
supply chain due to a truncated SHA-256 collision and command
injection. The attacker exploited the truncated hash to force the
server to return a malicious firmware, potentially compromising
devices. The issue was reported and fixed after investigation by the
OpenWrt team.

 According to Australia's official cyber security guidelines,
traditional asymmetric algorithms (like RSA and ECDH), shorter hash
lengths (SHA-224/256), and smaller AES key sizes will be deprecated by
2030 due to quantum computing threats.
