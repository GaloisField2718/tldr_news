ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PROCOLORED PRINTER SOFTWARE CONTAINED MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 After receiving a new direct-to-film printer from China-based
Procolored, YouTuber Cameron Coward engaged with cybersecurity
researcher Kirsten Hahn after his computer was infected by malware.
Hahn discovered that 39 files for products on Procolored's Mega.nz
account triggered malware detections for a cryptocurrency wallet
stealer and an XRed backdoor for Windows PCs. Hahn suggested that the
company may not have intentionally introduced the malicious files, as
the C2 server for XRed backdoor is offline. 

 HAZY HAWK GANG EXPLOITS DNS MISCONFIGS TO HIJACK TRUSTED DOMAINS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A threat actor tracked as Hazy Hawk is hijacking abandoned DNS CNAME
records pointing to abandoned cloud services to distribute scams, fake
apps, and malicious apps. Hazy Hawk scans for domains with dangling
CNAME records, then registers a new cloud resource with the same name
as the abandoned CNAME, and finally creates hundreds of malicious URLS
under it that redirect users to scam sites. It has hijacked subdomains
from cdc[.]gov, ted[.]com, nyu[.]edu, and unicef[.]org among others. 

 VIRGIN MEDIA O2 PATCHES HOLE THAT LET CALLERS SNOOP ON YOUR
COORDINATES (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 UK telecom Virgin Media O2 fixed a security flaw in its 4G calling
that revealed users' location data to callers. Researcher Daniel
Williams discovered that call signaling messages contained IMSI, IMEI,
and cell ID data that could pinpoint recipients' locations within 100
square meters in urban areas.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MALWARE ATTACK AND COUNTERATTACK (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Artist Antoine Schmitt describes a phishing attack that he was a
victim of which led to installing the AMOS infostealer. Schmitt was
contacted by a threat actor masquerading as a very professional
journalist for a magazine called Artscope Magazine. The journalist had
Schmitt download and install a trojanized video app that executed an
AppleScript payload to download and run the infostealer. 

 RED TEAM GOLD: EXTRACTING CREDENTIALS FROM MDT SHARES (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 While SCCM gets security attention, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
(MDT) often exposes similar vulnerabilities. Misconfigured MDT
deployment shares frequently allow unauthorized access to credentials
stored in configuration files, task sequences, and scripts. These
credentials can potentially grant domain admin access or control over
deployed systems. 

 INSECURE CREDENTIAL STORAGE PLAGUES MCP (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many MCP environments rely upon long-lived credentials such as API
keys, but they store them incorrectly in world-readable files or get
leaked via chat logs. The community-provided MCP server for Figma even
stores its credentials in a world-readable and world-writeable file
that attackers can use for session fixation attacks. OAuth should be
implemented in MCP servers for apps that support it, and other MCP
servers should consider using OS native credentials stores such as
macOS Keychain and Windows' Credentials Storage API.

 NEW ATTACK CAN STEAL CRYPTOCURRENCY BY PLANTING FALSE MEMORIES IN AI
CHATBOTS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Research reveals AI-powered crypto trading bots can be manipulated
through prompt injection attacks on ElizaOS, an open-source framework.
Attackers can plant false memories in the bot's database, causing it
to redirect payments to their wallets. 

 AWS DEFAULT IAM ROLES FOUND TO ENABLE LATERAL MOVEMENT AND
CROSS-SERVICE EXPLOITATION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers discovered dangerous default IAM roles in AWS services
that grant excessive permissions like full S3 access. These roles
enable attackers to escalate privileges and move laterally across
services, potentially compromising entire AWS accounts. AWS has
modified the AmazonS3FullAccess policy in response. 

 KREBSONSECURITY HIT WITH NEAR-RECORD 6.3 TBPS DDOS (7 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 KrebsOnSecurity was hit by a huge 6.3 Tbps DDoS attack, likely as a
test by a new botnet called Aisuru. The botnet uses hacked Internet of
Things (IoT) devices and is linked to a person known as "Forky" who
sells DDoS services online. Experts say releasing the botnet's code
might weaken its power by creating more, smaller botnets.
