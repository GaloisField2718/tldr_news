ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BROADCOM FIXES HIGH-SEVERITY VMWARE NSX BUGS REPORTED BY NSA (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Broadcom has patched two high-severity VMware NSX vulnerabilities
(CVE-2025-41251 and CVE-2025-41252) reported by the NSA, both
involving username enumeration flaws in password recovery mechanisms
that allow unauthenticated attackers to identify valid usernames for
potential brute-force attacks. These vulnerabilities affect VMware
NSX, a critical networking virtualization solution widely used in
enterprise private and hybrid cloud environments, making them
attractive targets for state-sponsored hackers and ransomware groups
that frequently exploit VMware products. Security professionals should
immediately apply the available patches and review their VMware
infrastructure for other recent vulnerabilities, as this follows a
pattern of actively exploited VMware zero-days throughout 2025,
including those used by Chinese state actors and disclosed at security
conferences. 

 VOLVO GROUP EMPLOYEE DATA STOLEN IN RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Volvo has reported that a hack of a third-party IT company,
Miljödata, impacted it. The attackers breached the company's Adato
support system for rehabilitation and Novi support system for HHR
personnel notes. The Volvo Group stated that the incident impacted its
employees' names and SSNs. 

 EXPLOIT ALLOWS FOR TAKEOVER OF FLEETS OF UNITREE ROBOTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Security researchers discovered a wormable vulnerability in the
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Wi-Fi configuration interface used by
several Unitree robots, which could result in remote code execution.
Unitree robots utilize an initial BLE connection to facilitate the
setup of a Wi-Fi connection. However, the encryption keys for the
packets that the robot accepts were published on X. The researchers
discovered that if an attacker encrypts the word “unitree” with
these keys, the robot will allow them to inject arbitrary code
masquerading as the Wi-Fi SSID and password, which will then be
executed when the robot tries to connect to Wi-Fi.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ECHOES OF AI EXPOSURE: THOUSANDS OF SECRETS LEAKING THROUGH VIBE
CODED SITES (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 1 in 5 websites built on "vibe coding" platforms (no-code/low-code
tools) expose sensitive secrets, with 25,000 leaked API keys found
across 130,000 scanned sites, including a surge in AI platform
credentials (72% Google Gemini, 14% OpenAI) and 16,000+ Firebase
backend keys. The root cause is non-technical users following
tutorials that embed API keys directly into client-side code without
understanding the security implications, creating opportunities for
credential theft and unauthorized service usage. Security teams should
implement continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) to monitor
citizen developer activities, while platforms need pre-publish secret
scanning and better secret management features to prevent these
exposures. 

 AKIRA RANSOMWARE BREACHING MFA-PROTECTED SONICWALL VPN ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 In July, BleepingComputer reported that the Akira ransomware
operation was exploiting SonicWall SSL VPN devices to breach corporate
networks. SonicWall eventually linked the attacks to an improper
access control flaw that was patched and disclosed in late 2024.
Security firm Arctic Wolf now reports an ongoing campaign against
SonicWall firewalls, where threat actors are successfully logging into
accounts even when one-time passwords (OTPs) are enabled. Google
Threat Intelligence Group suggests that the attackers may have
harvested the OTP seeds earlier and waited to use them. 

 SILENT SMISHING: THE HIDDEN ABUSE OF CELLULAR ROUTER APIS (20 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 Threat actors have been exploiting APIs on over 572 Milesight
industrial cellular routers to send smishing campaigns targeting
European users since February 2022, with a primary focus on Belgium.
The messages impersonate government services, including CSAM (the
central system for identity and access management for the government's
online services) and eBox. The attackers leverage CVE-2023-43261 and
exposed APIs to remotely send SMS messages without authentication,
utilizing routers as a distributed infrastructure across multiple
countries to evade detection and enable mass phishing campaigns, with
over 40,000 messages sent to Swedish and Italian numbers in a single
campaign. Security professionals should audit cellular router
configurations for exposed SMS APIs, implement authentication
requirements, update firmware to versions beyond the vulnerable 32.x
and 41.x versions, and monitor for unusual POST requests to /cgi
endpoints. Additionally, they should educate users to scrutinize
unsolicited SMS messages that contain shortened URLs or use urgent
language.

 CISA 2015 CYBER THREAT INFO-SHARING LAW LAPSES AMID GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 expired on
September 30 due to a government shutdown, removing critical liability
protections that enabled private sector cybersecurity threat
information sharing with the government and peers. Without these legal
safeguards, organizations now face potential antitrust violations,
FOIA disclosure risks, and loss of trade secret protections when
sharing threat intelligence, significantly reducing real-time threat
visibility across critical infrastructure sectors. Security
professionals should immediately consult with legal counsel before
engaging in any threat-sharing activities and may need to revert to
pre-2015 bilateral agreements, where available, as the timing for
congressional reauthorization remains uncertain. 

 PHANTOM TAURUS: A NEW CHINESE NEXUS APT AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE
NET-STAR MALWARE SUITE (16 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Phantom Taurus is a Chinese state-sponsored APT group targeting
government and telecom organizations across Africa, the Middle East,
and Asia for espionage aligned with PRC interests. Evolving from email
attacks to database targeting, it utilizes custom tools like the
NET-STAR malware suite, which includes three fileless .NET backdoors
(IIServerCore, AssemblyExecuter V1/V2), to compromise IIS web servers.
It employs evasion tactics such as AMSI and ETW bypasses. Security
teams should watch for TTPs such as timestomping, fileless execution
within w3wp.exe, and ASPX web shells, including OutlookEN.aspx, while
managing threat exposure to detect infrastructure sharing among
Chinese APT groups. 

 RED HAT OPENSHIFT AI FLAW EXPOSES HYBRID CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE TO FULL
TAKEOVER (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-10725) has been identified in Red
Hat OpenShift AI that allows authenticated attackers to escalate
privileges and potentially compromise entire cloud environments.
Versions 2.19, 2.21, and RHOAI are affected. Red Hat recommends
limiting permissions, especially for system groups, and suggests
granting job creation rights only to specific users or groups to
minimize risk.
