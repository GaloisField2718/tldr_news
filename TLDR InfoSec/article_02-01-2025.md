ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 JUNIPER WARNS OF MIRA'S BOTNET TARGETING SESSION SMART ROUTERS (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Juniper Networks is warning that session smart routers are being
targeted by a Mirai botnet infection campaign. The default passwords
for these devices have been added to the virus database. Juniper warns
that any devices using the default passwords should be assumed to be
compromised. It has provided threat hunting advice and is urging
admins to reimage any infected devices. 

 BEYONDTRUST SAYS HACKERS BREACHED REMOTE SUPPORT SAAS INSTANCES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 BeyondTrust identified a security incident in which an attacker
obtained a Remote Support SaaS API key which it used to access some
Remote Support SaaS instances and reset passwords for local
application users. As part of its investigation, BeyondTrust
discovered two CVEs that could allow for RCE but did not mark either
as being actively exploited. BeyondTrust has patched all cloud
instances against these CVEs and is working with customers to ensure
that self-hosted instances are patched. 

 FOUR-FAITH INDUSTRIAL ROUTER CVE-2024-12856 EXPLOITED IN THE WILD (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new post-authentication vulnerability in Four-Faith industrial
routers, CVE-2024-12856, is being exploited in the wild. Using default
credentials for remote command injection, the attack targets specific
router models over HTTP, allowing attackers to execute commands on
vulnerable devices. VulnCheck has notified Four-Faith and customers
about the issue and recommends contacting Four-Faith for information
on patches and affected models.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPLOITING PUBLIC AWS RESOURCES - CLI ATTACK PLAYBOOK (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A glossary of exploitation techniques for exploiting AWS resources
that can be misconfigured to be publicly accessible. Each attack
features relevant CLI commands to carry it out as well as sometimes
featuring a sample resource policy that could allow for it. The first
section focuses on resources that can be found from a black box
perspective and includes: exploiting S3 buckets for public list, read,
and write, exploiting S3 buckets for authenticated list and write,
exploiting S3 static site hosting or misconfigured CloudFront
distributions for unauthenticated bucket list, exploiting EC2 to
discover AMIs, exploiting EBS and RDS to discover public snapshots,
exploiting misconfigured OIDC roles, and exploiting public SSM
documents. The second section focuses on resources that can't be
discovered from a black box perspective and includes: exploiting
public SQS queues and SNS topics, exploiting private API gateways,
exploiting Lambda functions, and exploiting public and private ECR
repositories. 

 WICKED PANDA APT ADVERSARY SIMULATION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This README explains a simulation of an attack by the Wicked Panda
group targeting government networks. The attack involves stages like
DodgeBox DLL loader and MoonWalk backdoor for data exfiltration via
Google Drive API. The attackers use techniques like DLL sideloading
and hashing to evade detection and establish communication channels. 

 SIMPLE PROMPTS TO GET THE SYSTEM PROMPTS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post covers various methods, like expanding the prompt or
encoding it in base64, that can be used to extract system prompts from
AI models, potentially bypassing developer-imposed limits.
Understanding these tricks can show the vulnerabilities in AI models
and how they can be manipulated to disclose hidden prompts.

 HOW WE ARE SELF HOSTING CODE SCANNING AT REDDIT (13 MINUTE READ) [12]


 Reddit has a service for code scanning at the commit level or on a
schedule. It uses CLI tools to scan specific files or entire
repositories for security issues. The service enables dynamic scanning
with various CLI tools, including open source and in-house built
tools.

 AWS POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY MIGRATION PLAN (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 AWS is preparing for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) by implementing
NIST-approved algorithms to protect against future quantum computer
threats to public key cryptography. Its migration plan consists of
four workstreams: creating an inventory of current crypto usage
(prioritizing data-in-transit), updating asymmetric key derivation
between AWS endpoints and customers, addressing long-term digital
signature keys, and handling short-term session signature keys. AWS
recommends organizations prepare by making an inventory of their
cryptography usage and upgrading to TLS 1.3. 

 SO… YOU THOUGHT YOUR VPN WAS KEEPING YOU SAFE AND SECURE? (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 VPNs have become ubiquitous as a way for protecting access to
sensitive resources in organizations and preserving privacy for
individuals. This has made VPNs a valuable target for attackers with
VPN vulnerabilities on the rise since 2022. This article examines
attacks in VPNs from Check Point, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, and
Ivanti. For each vulnerability, the author demonstrates how to exploit
the vulnerability and its impact. 

 MISP-STANDARD.ORG - INTRODUCING THE MISP THREAT ACTOR NAMING STANDARD
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The MISP-standard.org has introduced a new Threat Actor Naming
Standard for cybersecurity information sharing. This standard aims to
provide a structured approach for naming threat actors to improve
collaboration and interoperability in the cybersecurity community. It
offers global consistency, interoperability with existing platforms
like MISP, and benefits such as enhanced collaboration and streamlined
analysis.
