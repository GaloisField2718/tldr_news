STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BITLOCKER STALE RECOVERY KEY CLEANUP: NO MORE SILENT ENCRYPTION
FAILURES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The author discusses how they discovered a new unannounced BitLocker
feature in a Windows Insider Preview build that automatically cleans
up stale recovery keys when the 200-key limit is reached in Microsoft
Entra ID. Using IDA Pro to analyze the fveskybackup.dll file, along
with Fiddler and ETL traces for monitoring API calls, the author
uncovered two critical functions that handle the automatic deletion of
stale recovery keys in batches of 16. This discovery points to the
resolution of a long-standing issue where silent encryption would fail
when hitting the key limit, eliminating the need for manual cleanup by
IT administrators once the feature reaches general availability. 

 IMPLEMENTING CLUSTERING WORKFLOWS IN ELASTIC TO ENHANCE SEARCH
RELEVANCE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post from Elastic walks through how machine learning
models, particularly clustering techniques like k-means can be
utilized in the ELK stack to improve search relevance by grouping
similar documents together. To demonstrate this, the post uses a 20
Newsgroups dataset and OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model, and
demonstrates that clear cluster separation and accurate clustering
results were achieved. The workflow showcased in this blog allows
Elastic users to easily implement advanced clustering techniques for
various applications, showing high performance and potential for
further enhancements. 

 OFFENSIVE KERBEROS TECHNIQUES FOR DETECTION ENGINEERING (17 MINUTE
READ) [10]

authentication mechanism for Active Directory. This article presents
an in-depth overview of different attacks like Kerberoasting,
unconstrained delegation, constrained delegation, and others against
Kerberos and methods for detection and mitigation. Each attack
includes necessary background information, a description of the attack
and potential impact, and strategies for detecting the attack.

 UK DEMANDS APPLE BREAK ENCRYPTION TO ALLOW GOV'T SPYING WORLDWIDE,
REPORTS SAY (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The UK government reportedly issued a secret order requiring Apple to
create a backdoor for accessing encrypted iCloud data worldwide. Apple
is likely to withdraw encrypted storage in the UK rather than comply,
as it argues such backdoors would compromise user security globally. 

 RESEARCHER OUTSMARTS, JAILBREAKS OPENAI'S NEW O3-MINI (4 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 A security researcher, Eran Shimony has successfully bypassed
OpenAI's new "deliberative alignment" safety feature in o3-mini,
getting it to provide Windows exploit instructions by posing as a
historian. According to Shimony, OpenAI's models are particularly
susceptible to natural language social engineering attacks, while
Meta's Llama models are instead vulnerable to ASCII art-encoded
malicious prompts, and Claude is most vulnerable to generating harmful
code because it doesn't effectively classify code's potential
malicious uses. 

 VSCODE'S SSH AGENT IS BANANAS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Thomas Ptacek writes about how VSCode's SSH Agent defies the
intuition that a security researcher familiar with similar tools like
Emacs Tramp might have. Unlike Tramp, which operates minimally on
remote systems using existing shell commands, VSCode's SSH Agent
installs a full Node.js environment and runs an agent with extensive
capabilities including filesystem access, file editing, shell process
launching, and self-persistence - behaviors that make security
professionals nervous, especially in production environments. Thomas
ends the blog by noting that Fly.io is able to accomplish the same
remote development feature on their instances without such invasive
installation on remote hosts.
