ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NISSAN SAYS THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS EXPOSED IN RED HAT BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Nissan has confirmed that data belonging to approximately 21k
customers was breached via a data breach at Red Hat in September. The
breached data includes full names, physical and email addresses, phone
numbers, and sales data for some customers who purchased or received
services at Nissan in Fukuoka, Japan. 

 FRENCH POSTAL SERVICE BROUGHT DOWN BY CYBER ATTACK (1 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 France's postal service, La Poste, suffered a widespread DDoS attack
that disabled all IT systems for over twelve hours, affecting the
website, mobile app, Digiposte digital document service, and digital
ID services. The attack also disrupted La Poste's banking subsidiary
Banque Postale's online services, though over-the-counter operations
and payment processing remained functional. The timing raised concerns
about potential Christmas delivery disruptions, with no timeline
provided for service restoration. 

 3.5 MILLION AFFECTED BY UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX DATA BREACH (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A ransomware-linked campaign exploited zero-day flaws in Oracle
E-Business Suite to access University of Phoenix systems, leading to
data theft affecting nearly 3.5 million people. Exposed data includes
names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and bank account
details, though no leak has yet appeared online.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 C2 REDIRECTORS MADE EASY (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Red teamers traditionally must manually configure C2 redirector proxy
rules by reviewing profiles and adding User-Agent strings and HTTP
endpoints to configuration files, requiring updates whenever the C2
profile changes. The author developed caddy-c2, a Caddy web server
module that automatically parses Cobalt Strike profiles using
goMalleable to extract User-Agents and URI paths, then dynamically
routes legitimate C2 traffic without manual rule configuration. The
module simplifies redirector deployment by eliminating the need to
manually sync proxy configurations with C2 profile changes, though
current support is limited to Cobalt Strike, with plans to expand to
frameworks such as Mythic and Havoc. 

 HOW TO HACK DISCORD, VERCEL AND MORE WITH ONE EASY TRICK - EVA'S SITE
(11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mintlify lets customers write pages in MDX, but processes that
content in a way that allows attackers to run arbitrary JavaScript on
the server during build. This means an attacker can take over the
build environment, poison cached pages, and inject malicious scripts
into many companies' docs, including big names like Discord and
Vercel. Because some docs were served from the same domain or path as
real apps, those scripts could steal auth tokens or perform actions as
logged-in users. 

 MODERNIZING LINKEDIN'S STATIC APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING
CAPABILITIES TO PROTECT OUR MEMBERS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LinkedIn modernized its SAST pipeline by building custom GitHub
Actions workflows using CodeQL and Semgrep that deviated from paved
paths to accommodate complex internal build processes, implementing
dynamic rule filtering, SARIF enrichment, and extensive metrics
instrumentation across tens of thousands of repositories. The team
deployed a "stub workflow" approach combined with a Drift Management
System that daily checks repository compliance and automatically
commits workflow files, ensuring consistent security coverage while
allowing centralized updates without touching individual repos.
LinkedIn implemented "blocking mode" enforcement via GitHub Repository
Rulesets requiring SARIF submission and zero high-risk vulnerabilities
before PR merges, protected by multi-level kill switches
(organization/repo/language/tool/rule-specific) and fail-safe
mechanisms that upload blank SARIFs to unblock developers during
scanning failures while triggering oncall alerts.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLR-UNHOOK (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 CLR-Unhook is a native C++ utility that bypasses EDR/AV hooks in the
.NET Common Language Runtime by restoring the original nLoadImage
function implementation. 

 GOSTRINGUNGARBLER (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Mandiant released GoStringUngarbler, a Python tool that deobfuscates
strings in Go binaries protected by garble's literal transformation
flag, supporting Windows PE and Linux ELF executables compiled with
Garble v0.11.0-v0.13.0 and Go v1.21-v1.23. The tool identifies
decrypting subroutines via regex pattern matching, emulates them using
the Unicorn emulator to extract plaintext strings, and patches the
binary by replacing obfuscation routines with stubs that directly
reference the decrypted content. Security analysts can use this to
accelerate malware analysis of garble-obfuscated Go samples, though it
only works when garble's "-literals" flag was used during compilation.


 GAMBIT CYBER (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Gambit Cyber provides an AI-native, risk-centric continuous threat
exposure management platform called KnightGuard. It uses coordinated
AI agents to help enterprises continuously identify, validate,
prioritize, and remediate cyber risks across CTI, SecOps, and IT
operations.

 LIBXML2 NARROWLY AVOIDS BECOMING UNMAINTAINED (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The libxml2 library temporarily lost its sole volunteer maintainer,
Nick Wellnhofer, after years of unpaid security work, creating a
critical risk for GNOME, web browsers, and countless projects
depending on this XML/XSLT processing library. Wellnhofer experienced
burnout from companies that sent security reports, expecting immediate
CVE responses and patches, with no financial compensation beyond a
single Google donation, while providing no code contributions or test
cases. Two new maintainers have assumed responsibility, but the
incident highlights the unsustainable model in which commercial
software relies on unpaid volunteers to maintain critical
infrastructure components. 

 THE 5 SECURITY FEATURES THAT WILL LEAD IN 2026, AND 3 THAT SHOULD (6
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Security market analyst James Berthoty predicts that supply chain and
AI tooling will dominate the market in 2026. Berthoty predicts that
the following critical product capabilities will be essential: supply
chain malware detection, AI vulnerability remediation and
prioritization, AI visibility, guardrails, testing, AI based
detections, and SOC augmenters. Teams should also have runtime
function level reachability (ADR), developer endpoint security, and
realtime AI threat modeling and design review on their radar. 

 OPENAI SAYS AI BROWSERS MAY ALWAYS BE VULNERABLE TO PROMPT INJECTION
ATTACKS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenAI acknowledges that prompt injection attacks in AI browsers like
ChatGPT Atlas are a long-term, unsolved security risk, similar to
social engineering on the web. The company is layering defenses,
including an LLM-based automated attacker that repeatedly probes Atlas
in simulation to discover new attack strategies, tighten protections,
and enforce user confirmations. Experts still question whether the
current agentic browser value justifies their elevated risk.
