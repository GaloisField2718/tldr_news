 OPAQUE PREDICATES AND HOW TO HUNT THEM (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Opaque predicates are a conditional expression that the programmer
knows the answer to but chooses to check anyway. They can be utilized
to obscure the control flow for anti-reversing. This post utilizes the
MIASM Python library to create an IDA Pro plugin to detect and patch
unreachable blocks. The plugin utilizes the Symbolic Execution engine
to detect opaque predicates and then patches them with NOPs. 

 HACKING MISCONFIGURED CLOUDFLARE R2 BUCKETS: A COMPLETE GUIDE (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post discusses how to hack Cloudflare R2 buckets to
discover sensitive files. Begin by utilizing Google dorking and
examining HTTP requests to discover R2 buckets. Exploitation can then
be done via abusing missing or improper authorization checks or
finding exposed R2.dev buckets. 

 HOW TO INTERCEPT DATA EXFILTRATED BY MALWARE VIA TELEGRAM AND DISCORD
(9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post explains how to gather information on threat actors,
using Telegram API to identify them and attribute malware samples. It
demonstrates steps to intercept data exfiltrated by malware through
Telegram and Discord, including obtaining bot tokens, chat IDs, and
forwarding messages for analysis. The post provides scripts and
examples for interacting with Telegram bots and Discord webhooks to
monitor and analyze malware activities in real time.
