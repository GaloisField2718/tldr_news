 PLATFORMS OR STAND-ALONE TOOLS: WHAT DO SECOPS TEAMS PREFER, AND WHY?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 One of the most visible trends in cybersecurity is the emergence of
platforms that offer capabilities across multiple technology segments.
SentinelOne and 451 Research have partnered together to survey 600+
security practitioners and leaders [4] to understand this trend and
what SecOps teams are choosing and why they are choosing them. 

Read the latest 451 Research report to learn more [4].

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ENDGAME GEAR MOUSE CONFIG TOOL INFECTED USERS WITH MALWARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 German peripherals maker Endgame Gear is warning users that malware
was embedded in its configuration tool for the OP1w 4k v2 mouse
between June 26 and July 9. The malicious version of the download
included the XRed backdoor, which features keylogging capabilities,
the ability to open a remote shell, and data exfiltration. Endgame
Gear has announced that, going forward, it will discontinue hosting
separate download pages and will add SHA hash verification and digital
signing for all hosted files. 

 LOVENSE SEX TOY APP FLAW LEAKS PRIVATE USER EMAIL ADDRESSES (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A group of security researchers discovered two vulnerabilities in the
Lovense sex toy app that could allow an attacker to retrieve a user's
private email address with just their username and perform an account
takeover with just an email address. To exploit the flaw, an attacker
sends a POST request to the `/api/wear/genGtoken` API endpoint, then
forwards the encrypted payload to another endpoint, which returns a
fake ID that the user can add to their contact list to reveal the real
email address. Lovense claims that both flaws were fixed. However,
researchers report that only the account takeover flaw was fixed. 

 TELECOM GIANT ORANGE WARNS OF DISRUPTION AMID ONGOING CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 French telecom giant Orange reported a cyberattack on July 25 that
disrupted services for business clients and some public sector
services in France. The company isolated affected systems and expects
full restoration by Wednesday. Orange claims no customer or internal
data was compromised and has notified the relevant authorities about
the incident.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WIZ RESEARCH UNCOVERS CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN AI VIBE CODING
PLATFORM BASE44 ALLOWING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PRIVATE APPLICATIONS
(8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Wiz Research discovered a critical vulnerability in Base44, a popular
"vibe coding" platform that allows users to build apps through natural
language prompts. The flaw allowed attackers to bypass authentication
using only non-secret app IDs, potentially granting access to private
enterprise applications and sensitive data. 

 FAKE CAPTCHA LED TO LUMMA (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers used a fake CAPTCHA page that employed the ClickFix social
engineering technique to trick users into pressing Windows+R and
pasting a PowerShell command that downloaded LUMMA stealer malware.
The malware targeted browser credential stores (Login Data and Web
Data) from Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, establishing C2
communication within minutes of initial execution. The attack chain
leveraged multiple evasion techniques, including heavily obfuscated
PowerShell, AutoIt scripts, and mshta.exe proxy execution to bypass
security controls. 

 BUILDING A CLOUD SECURITY ROADMAP: TOOLS BY LAYER AND WHEN YOU NEED
THEM (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post provides an overview of the layers in cloud environments,
the threats that target each layer, and the tools that are best suited
to address them. The cloud infrastructure/control plane layer handles
tasks such as resource provisioning, configuration management, and
user permissions. The orchestration layer hosts platforms such as
Kubernetes and related services live, whereas the platform layer runs
more generalized workloads. Finally, the application layer includes
software that end-users rely on, such as custom web applications,
APIs, and SaaS apps.

 SECURITY PROS ARE DROWNING IN THREAT-INTEL DATA AND IT'S MAKING
EVERYTHING MORE DANGEROUS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A Google Cloud and Forrester study of 1,541 tech leaders found that
61% of security professionals are overwhelmed by threat intelligence
data, while 60% lack skilled analysts. Top concerns include phishing
(46%), ransomware (44%), and AI prompt injection attacks (34%). 

 PYPI USERS EMAIL PHISHING ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 PyPI users are being targeted by phishing emails from "pypj[.]org"
(note the "j"), which request email verification. The fake site mimics
PyPI to steal credentials. Users should delete these emails, avoid
clicking any links, and change their passwords if compromised. 

 NEW CHOICEJACKING ATTACK STEALS DATA FROM PHONES VIA PUBLIC CHARGERS
(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Choicejacking is a new attack that bypasses smartphone security
prompts by spoofing USB or Bluetooth input devices to simulate user
actions in under 133 milliseconds. The attack tricks phones into
enabling data transfer mode without consent, allowing attackers to
access photos, messages, and install malware through compromised
public charging stations. Unlike traditional juice jacking attacks,
Choicejacking exploits device communication protocols to simulate
keyboard input and overflow input buffers, affecting both Android and
iOS devices.
