 👀 DARE TO SEE WHAT'S LURKING IN YOUR MICROSOFT 365 ENVIRONMENT?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Threat actors don't need to break in anymore—they just log in. The
Huntress Identity Security Assessment [4] shows you where. Start a
Managed ITDR trial [4] and you'll get a FREE customized report for
your Microsoft 365 tenant, INSTANTLY.

It shows you:

 	* Which accounts and logins look risky,
 	* Rogue apps granting way too much access,
 	* Hidden inbox rules attackers love to abuse,
 	* Suspicious activity that screams “stolen creds.”

It's quick, visual, and maybe a little unsettling (in a good way).
Happy hunting… 🔍

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RESEARCHERS WARN OF FLAWS THAT ALLOW MANIPULATION OF MICROSOFT TEAMS
MESSAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers from Check Point have discovered four vulnerabilities
that allow attackers to manipulate Teams messages. The vulnerabilities
could allow attackers to edit Teams messages without leaving the
“edited” label, alter message notifications so they appear to be
from a different sender, change the display name inside private chats,
and alter caller identities in video and audio calls. 

 CRITICAL REACT NATIVE CLI FLAW EXPOSED MILLIONS OF DEVELOPERS TO
REMOTE ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A severe vulnerability in the widely used @react-native-community/cli
npm package posed a high risk, allowing remote attackers to execute
malicious OS commands on developers' machines running the React Native
development server. Affecting millions and scoring 9.8 in severity,
the flaw was patched in version 20.0.0. 

 GOOGLE UNCOVERS PROMPTFLUX MALWARE THAT USES GEMINI AI TO REWRITE ITS
CODE HOURLY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google identified PROMPTFLUX, an experimental malware, using a
hardcoded Gemini API key to query Google's LLM with prompts for code
obfuscation and AV evasion. It was able to self-modify and rewrite its
source code to evade detection. Believed to be in testing by a
financially-motivated actor, the malware includes a "Thinking Robot'
that logs AI responses, persists via Windows Startup, and attempts
propagation through drives and network shares, though it currently has
no real attack capabilities. Security teams should monitor
LLM-assisted malware like other variants, implement API key rotation,
and be aware of threat actors bypassing AI safety via social
engineering.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OAUTH DEVICE CODE PHISHING: AZURE VS. GOOGLE COMPARED (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Device code phishing exploits OAuth 2.0's legitimate device
authorization flow to steal access tokens by tricking victims into
authenticating attacker-generated device codes, with Microsoft Azure
allowing attackers to request powerful scopes (including Primary
Refresh Tokens) through undocumented "Family of Client IDs" while
Google severely restricts device flow to only YouTube and Google Drive
scopes. Azure's implementation enables attackers to use legitimate
Microsoft URLs and APIs throughout the entire attack chain without
requiring client authentication, making phishing campaigns highly
effective at bypassing MFA and gaining initial access with tokens
scoped to Graph API, Intune enrollment, or other sensitive resources.
Security teams should implement Conditional Access policies that
restrict device code authentication, monitor suspicious device code
flow usage patterns in Azure sign-in logs, educate users about the
risks of entering codes from unsolicited communications, and consider
Google's restrictive scope model as a defensive blueprint for limiting
OAuth attack surface. 

 BEDROCK'N'ROLL: ANNOYING TRUST RELATIONSHIPS IN BEDROCK SERVICE ROLES
(4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon Bedrock provides a wizard for creating execution roles using
the Agent Builder UI. The trust policy on the created role allows any
agent in the account to assume the role by default via a wildcard
aws:SourceArn condition. Users should ensure that this condition is
scoped to their specific agent. 

 FIXING THE BLINDSPOT IN ENDPOINT SECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Deploying Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to developer
endpoints often presents complications, as security tools are
sometimes not well-suited to developer workflows. This leads to many
organizations putting in extensive exemptions for developer endpoints,
significantly weakening their security posture. This post advocates
for a developer MDM that operates by injecting visibility using
existing agents such as Zscaler and CrowdStrike.

 HOW COMPLIANCE TEAMS CAN SAVE 15+ HOURS/WEEK WITH AGENTIC AI
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 SOC 2 and ISO 27001 shouldn't eat 40% of your team's time in 2026.
Sprinto [11] uses Agentic AI to autonomously collect evidence, monitor
risks, and keep you audit-read. Anaconda got compliant with Sprinto
and closed a seven-figure deal within weeks. TLDR readers get $1,000
off [11] + an Ultrahuman Ring once you get compliant.

 VEGA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Vega delivers AI-powered security analytics and operations. It
streamlines SOC workflows by analyzing data in place, surfacing
critical alerts, and automatically fixing coverage gaps and noisy
rules for faster response. 

 ACUNETIX (PRODUCT) [14] 

 Acunetix is a comprehensive web application vulnerability scanner
that performs in-depth testing of modern, JavaScript-heavy apps, APIs,
and traditional web platforms to identify issues such as SQL
injection, XSS, and complex logic flaws, all with low false positives
through automated verification. It seamlessly integrates into CI/CD
pipelines to enable continuous security testing during development and
offers compliance reporting for standards such as PCI DSS, HIPAA,
GDPR, and OWASP Top 10. Security teams can utilize Acunetix for
pre-production assessments, embed it into DevSecOps workflows for
early testing, and leverage its API scanning capabilities to secure
microservices and GraphQL endpoints that are often missed by
traditional scanners.

 PHONE LOCATION DATA OF TOP EU OFFICIALS FOR SALE, REPORT FINDS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Journalists discovered that location data from top EU officials was
being sold by brokers, making it easy to track officials' movements,
even with Europe's strict privacy laws. A leaked dataset revealed
precise information on officials' whereabouts and highlighted weak
enforcement against brokers. 

 GOOGLE EXPANDS CHROME AUTOFILL TO PASSPORTS AND LICENSES, BUT IS IT
SAFE? (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google Chrome now supports autofill for sensitive documents like
passports and driver's licenses, with encryption and user consent.
However, security experts warn that this centralizes critical identity
data in a vulnerable location, contradicting cybersecurity advice
against storing such info in browsers. Malware like Shuyal Stealer
targets browser-stored credentials, and Chrome autofill data isn't
stored securely. Security teams should advise against storing
sensitive IDs in autofill, enforce policies to restrict this in
workplaces, monitor for info-stealer malware, and recommend dedicated
password managers with stronger encryption instead of browser storage.


 CLOUDFLARE SCRUBS AISURU BOTNET FROM TOP DOMAINS LIST (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The Aisuru botnet, with hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT
devices and 30 Tbps DDoS power, manipulated Cloudflare's domain
rankings by switching from Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS to Cloudflare's
1.1.1.1 in October. This caused malicious domains, mainly in the .su
TLD, to outrank major companies like Amazon and Google due to massive
DNS queries. The incident revealed vulnerabilities in trust-based
domain ranking systems, which treat highly-ranked domains as
trustworthy, and attackers used mainly US-based compromised devices
from ISPs such as AT&T and Verizon. Security teams should monitor DNS
connections to the .su TLD, block it if needed, and avoid relying
solely on domain popularity for trust, as DNS query volume can be
artificially inflated by botnets.
