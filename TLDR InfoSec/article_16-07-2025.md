 CANDIDATE FRAUD IS A SECURITY ISSUE (SPONSOR) [1] 

 Remote hiring, deepfakes, and interview-cheating tools create a
dangerous opportunity for bad actors. Rigid identity verification at
every step solves it, but makes life hell for your honest employees.

Persona's Know Your Employee (KYE) solution [1] lets you automate
identity verification throughout the employee life cycle, while
minimizing friction and help desk tickets by only triggering when it's
actually needed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CENTURY SUPPORT SERVICES DATA BREACH EXPOSES PERSONAL INFORMATION:
MURPHY LAW FIRM INVESTIGATES LEGAL CLAIMS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Murphy Law Firm is investigating a class action lawsuit against
Century Support Services following a November 2024 data breach that
compromised the personal information of 160,759 individuals. Exposed
data includes Social Security numbers, financial account information,
medical records, and driver's licenses. The firm is seeking damages
for affected individuals whose sensitive information may now be
available to cybercriminals. 

 RANSOMWARE GROUP CLAIMS ATTACK ON BELK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The ransomware group DragonForce attacked US department store chain
Belk in May, compromising the names and Social Security numbers of
customers. The attack disrupted online and physical operations for
days, with Belk's website still offline. DragonForce claims to have
exfiltrated 156GB of data and made it publicly available, suggesting
no ransom was paid. 

 EXPLOITED WING FILE TRANSFER BUG RISKS TOTAL SERVER COMPROMISE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The CISA is warning users of a new critical (CVSS 10/10)
vulnerability in the Wing FTP software that is under active
exploitation. The vulnerability stems from Wing FTP software not
sanitizing usernames that contain a NULL byte and then constructing a
Lua session file from the username, which can potentially include Lua
code after the NULL byte. Huntress and Arctic Wolf have both recorded
that they have seen attackers exploiting exposed servers to download
and execute malicious files, perform reconnaissance, and install
remote monitoring and management software.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WEAPONIZING WINDOWS DRIVERS: A HACKER'S GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This article introduces a four-part cybersecurity playbook on
analyzing and exploiting Windows kernel drivers. It highlights the
rising threat of BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) attacks,
where attackers exploit legitimate but flawed signed drivers to bypass
kernel protections. 

 WHAT IS A DETECTION ENGINEER? (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The first part of Zach Allen's Detection Engineering Field Manual
introduces the concept of detection engineering, which primarily
focuses on detecting when a threat actor circumvents controls. Allen
models SOC operations in three loops: Loop 1 identifies assets and
utilizes controls to protect them, Loop 2 employs rules to detect
threats and responds with containment, and finally, Loop 3 focuses on
recovering and learning from incidents. A detection engineer can focus
on one loop or all of them and should, at a minimum, possess some
coding expertise and a customer-centric mindset. 

 ENCRYPTING FILES WITH PASSKEYS AND AGE (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Typage 0.2.3 introduces passkey-based file encryption using the
WebAuthn PRF extension, allowing users to encrypt files that can only
be decrypted with biometric authentication or hardware security keys.
The implementation creates a new age recipient format (fido2prf) that
binds each encrypted file to specific hardware credentials, requiring
both the encrypted file and physical access to the authenticator for
decryption. Files encrypted on one device can be decrypted on another
through synced passkeys. A companion CLI plugin also enables this
functionality with FIDO2 hardware tokens outside the browser.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ZIP SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 Zip Security helps organizations implement security best practices
and achieve compliance, while also managing their IT infrastructure to
reduce service overhead and costs. 

 FALCO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Falco is a cloud native runtime security tool for Linux operating
systems. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and
potential security threats in real-time. 

 PATCHMAN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Patchman is a Django-based patch status monitoring system for Linux
servers.

 META FIXES BUG THAT COULD LEAK USERS' AI PROMPTS AND GENERATED
CONTENT (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Meta fixed a security bug that allowed users to access other users'
private AI prompts and responses by manipulating unique prompt
numbers. Security researcher Sandeep Hodkasia discovered the
vulnerability in December and received a $10,000 bug bounty. Meta
deployed the fix in January after finding no evidence of malicious
exploitation of the flaw. 

 THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS WERE MOVED TO THE UK IN A SECRET SCHEME
FOLLOWING A DATA LEAK (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 On Tuesday, it was revealed that in 2022, a British official
accidentally leaked data of Afghans who had applied to move to the UK
under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Program (ARAP). ARAP was
set up for Afghans who feared reprisal from the Taliban. The impacted
individuals are now being notified after a ‚Äúsuper injunction‚Äù that
prohibited discussion of the leak was lifted on Tuesday. 

 UK LAUNCHES VULNERABILITY RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR EXTERNAL EXPERTS (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The UK's NCSC announced the launch of a new Vulnerability Research
Initiative (VRI) to partner with external cybersecurity researchers.
Researchers who partner with the program will be given objectives to
identify flaws in specific projects of interest, assess proposed
mitigations, and then disclose the flaws through the ‚ÄúEquities
Process‚Äù procedure.
