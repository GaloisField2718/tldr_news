STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURITY IS A PRICING PROBLEM (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Pricing models impact security and software engineering teams
differently. Security vendors tend to extract more value due to higher
barriers to entry and limited ability for security teams to build
their own tools. The pricing dynamic in the security industry hinders
innovation and affordability, especially for smaller companies and
startups.

 FROM CVE TO TEMPLATE: THE FUTURE OF AUTOMATING NUCLEI TEMPLATES WITH
AI (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The ProjectDiscovery team decided to experiment with utilizing AI to
generate nuclei templates from CVEs. The team utilized cvemap to
identify CVEs that had a publicly available POC but did not already
have a nuclei template and then built TemplateMan to aid in adding
non-functional enhancements to the generated templates. They noted
issues in parsing technical details out of unstructured Medium and
other blog posts as well as issues with authenticated vulnerabilities
and data quality. The ProjectDiscovery team has created a new
repository to store the AI-generated templates and has also added the
capability to build nuclei templates with AI to their online template
editor.
