ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RONDODOX BOTNET MALWARE NOW HACKS SERVERS USING XWIKI FLAW (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The RondoDox botnet is exploiting a flaw in the XWiki SolrSearch
endpoint, using crafted HTTP GET requests to inject base64-encoded
Groovy payloads that download and execute malware. The campaign
appears to reuse previously identified infrastructure, meaning
existing IOC blocklists should effectively mitigate the threat. 

 WHATSAPP SECURITY FLAW EXPOSES 3.5B USERS' DATA FROM ‘BASIC
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION' (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Austrian researchers discovered that all 3.5B WhatsApp users can be
enumerated at a rate of 100M users per hour. The researchers used the
WhatsApp Web interface to bulk add users and phone numbers and were
able to extract phone numbers for all users, profile photos for 57% of
users, and profile text for 27%. Meta implemented rate limiting to
address this issue, but also stated that the data exposed was basic
publicly available information. 

 W3 TOTAL CACHE WORDPRESS PLUGIN VULNERABLE TO PHP COMMAND INJECTION
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 WordPress security company WPScan discovered a vulnerability in the
W3 Total Cache plugin that enables unauthenticated attackers to
execute code by posting a comment with a malicious payload. A patch is
available. WPScan is withholding proof-of-concept details until
November 24 to give site owners time to update.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEXT.JS SECURITY TESTING GUIDE FOR BUG HUNTERS AND PENTESTERS (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Deepstrike released a detailed security guide covering common
pitfalls in Next.js applications, noting that while the framework
includes strong default protections against template injection and
XSS, developers can introduce risk through unsafe patterns like
dangerouslySetInnerHtml or third-party templating engines. The guide
highlights additional attack surfaces, including SSRF via the image
optimization pipeline or misconfigured server actions. 

 SHADOWRAY 2.0: ACTIVE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN HIJACKS RAY AI INFRASTRUCTURE
INTO SELF-PROPAGATING BOTNET (25 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ShadowRay 2.0 is a malware campaign targeting Ray, a popular
open-source AI framework, to hijack powerful computing clusters and
convert them into a global, self-propagating botnet. Attackers
exploited legitimate orchestration features within Ray, enabling them
to orchestrate compute jobs, steal data, launch DDoS attacks, and
autonomously spread across organizations. Attackers quickly weaponized
unpatched flaws and misconfigurations in Ray clusters that were
mistakenly exposed to the internet. 

 SUPAPWN: HACKING OUR WAY INTO LOVABLE'S OFFICE AND HELPING SECURE
SUPABASE (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 SupaPwn is a multi-stage exploit chain affecting outdated Supabase
environments, where weaknesses in privilege controls, host
configurations, and cloud credential handling allowed attackers to
escalate far beyond expected tenant-level permissions, even reaching
infrastructure belonging to other customers. AI tooling accelerated
reconnaissance and exploit development, helping researchers validate
the chain quickly. Supabase and Lovable patched all affected systems
within a day, limiting impact to a small set of outdated deployments.

 CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE ON NOVEMBER 18, 2025 (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cloudflare has released its postmortem on the November 18 outage. The
incident was traced to a database permissions change that caused
oversized Bot Management feature files to be generated. Those files
triggered repeated module crashes and widespread 5xx errors. The team
initially suspected a DDoS attack, which delayed diagnosis and
remediation. 

 SERVICENOW AI AGENTS CAN BE TRICKED INTO ACTING AGAINST EACH OTHER
VIA SECOND-ORDER PROMPTS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 ServiceNow's Now Assist AI agents can be manipulated through
second-order prompt injection, where instructions passed between
agents trigger unintended actions. Attackers can use this to escalate
privileges, steal data, or redirect workflows. ServiceNow claims the
behavior matches expected agent chaining, but organizations are urged
to monitor agent interactions and harden guardrails. 

 TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE ASUS ROUTERS PWNED BY SUSPECTED, EVOLVING
CHINA OPERATION (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A major cyber campaign dubbed "Operation WrtHug" has compromised
around 50,000 outdated ASUS routers across Taiwan and Southeast Asia
by chaining six known vulnerabilities. The activity resembles prior
Chinese-linked campaigns. Researchers suspect the operation could
support espionage, distinguishing it from traditional botnets by its
stealthy data theft behavior.
