ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 COGUI PHISHING PLATFORM SENT 580M EMAILS TO STEAL CREDENTIALS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new phishing kit called CoGUI was used to send over 580M emails to
targets between January and April. The attack chain begins with an
email impersonating a legitimate site with an urgent subject line. The
email includes a link that checks if the victim's machine matches a
series of criteria such as IP, browser language, OS, etc, and presents
a fake login page if the criteria match or redirects the victim to the
legitimate site if not. CoGUI is the largest volume phishing campaign
Proofpoint is tracking. 

 KICKIDLER EMPLOYEE MONITORING SOFTWARE ABUSED IN RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Kickidler is an employee monitoring tool that can capture keystrokes,
take screenshots, and create videos of employees' screens. A new
ransomware campaign operates by using Google Ads masquerading as ads
for RVTools, a free Windows utility for managing VMware vSphere
deployments. This leads users to download a trojanized version of the
software that includes a PowerShell backdoor that deploys Kickidler on
the device. The ransomware operator then monitors the victim's (likely
an administrator) machine to collect credentials for sensitive systems
and off-site cloud backups without detection. 

 SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK HITS NPM PACKAGE WITH 45,000 WEEKLY DOWNLOADS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 rand-user-agent, an npm package, was compromised in a supply chain
attack that caused it to inject obfuscated code that activates a
remote access trojan (RAT) on users' systems. Aikido detected the
compromise on May 5, when its malware analysis flagged version
1.0.110. Researchers found obfuscated code hidden in 'dist/index.js',
visible only by scrolling horizontally in the npm site's source view.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DOCUMENT MY PENTEST: YOU HACK, THE AI WRITES IT UP! (4 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The PortSwigger research team developed a Burp AI extension that
automatically documents a pentest based on the request history. The
initial implementation was good at spotting Path Traversal
vulnerabilities, but struggled with more complex vulnerabilities like
XSS until the team added a regex translator to transform inputs. The
team found that the AI could be directly asked to explain why it
reported that a false positive was a vulnerability and how to improve
its prompt to classify vulnerabilities better. 

 THE MASSIVE, HIDDEN INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLING BIG GAME HUNTING AT SCALE
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Advertisers use Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSs) to direct
potential customers to highly targeted ads. Insikt Group has been
tracking how cybercriminals utilize malicious TDSs to direct victims
to the malware with the highest likelihood of success against the
target. Insikt Group has identified a TDS known as TAG-124 that is
used by multiple threat actors, such as the Rhysida
Ransomware-as-a-Service operation, Iterlock Ransomware, and TA866/
Asylum Ambuscade, but notes that TDSs are hard to defend against
because they occur so early in the cyberattack life cycle. 

 THE PATH TO MEMORY SAFETY IS INEVITABLE (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses memory safety approaches beyond language
choice, emphasizing comprehensive solutions including sanitizers,
fuzzers, and compiler-based mitigations. The practices include
selecting robust distributions like Debian, using tools like Fil-C for
C/C++ safety, and implementing runtime protections.

 OPEN SOURCE PROJECT CURL IS SICK OF USERS SUBMITTING “AI SLOP”
VULNERABILITIES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Daniel Stenberg, the original author of the curl project, posted on
LinkedIn about an increasing issue of AI-generated bug reports being
submitted to the program on HackerOne. Stenberg has said that
maintainers on the project are getting bogged down by “AI slop”
reports that include hallucinated vulnerabilities such as one that he
cites in the article in which the reported claimed to have found a
“novel exploit leveraging stream dependency cycles in the HTTP/3
protocol stack” but the reporter continuously gave nonsensical
responses to follow-up questions. Stenberg announced that any
reporters of “AI slop” vulnerabilities will be banned from the
project. 

 GOOGLE ROLLS OUT AI TOOLS TO PROTECT CHROME USERS AGAINST SCAMS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google is enhancing Chrome security with Gemini Nano, an on-device AI
model, to protect desktop users against scams through Enhanced
Protection mode. New AI warnings on Android will also help users
identify malicious notifications. Google claims these AI systems have
already reduced airline customer service scams by 80% and blocked
millions of scammy pages. 

 ADOPTING SUDO-RS BY DEFAULT IN UBUNTU 25.10 (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Ubuntu 25.10 will be the first major Linux distribution to adopt
sudo-rs, a Rust reimplementation of sudo developed by the Trifecta
Tech Foundation. This memory-safe alternative aims to enhance security
at the privilege boundary while maintaining compatibility. The
transition should be transparent for most users, though some niche
features may not be included.
