ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GITHUB BESIEGED BY MILLIONS OF MALICIOUS REPOSITORIES IN ONGOING
ATTACK (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 GitHub is struggling to contain an ongoing attack that is flooding
the site with millions of malicious code repositories mimicking
legitimate ones. The fake repositories contain hidden malware that
steals passwords and cryptocurrency from developers. Removing the
repositories is like playing whack-a-mole as some malicious forks are
surviving and getting re-forked, compounding the problem.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A KILLSWITCH FOR AI ‚Ä¶ DAISY, DAISY? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 As AI advances, serious questions arise about its potential impacts
on society. Could it destroy civilization, turn us into zombies, or
view humans as we view dogs? While AI poses risks, thoughtful
regulation and ethical development can help realize benefits and avoid
pitfalls depicted in sci-fi like 2001: A Space Odyssey with HAL. This
post dives into the current ways we are preparing against AI as a
society. 

 HACKING TERRAFORM STATE FOR PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Terraform can be configured to store state files in a remote backend.
This post looks at how attackers can leverage compromised state files.
It begins by demonstrating how an attacker could cause AWS resource
deletion by confusing a Terraform user into applying a modified state
file that results in resource deletion. It then goes on to demonstrate
the process of writing and publishing a malicious Terraform provider
that can execute code upon Terraform plan or apply and then
demonstrates how this can be combined with state file modification to
hijack CI/CD systems. 

 PASSKEYS: THREAT MODELING AND IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS (10
MINUTE READ) [10]
