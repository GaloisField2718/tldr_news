 4 YEAR CAMPAIGN BACKDOORED IPHONES USING POSSIBLY THE MOST ADVANCED
EXPLOIT EVER (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have unveiled new findings surrounding an attack that
backdoored iPhones belonging to Kaspersky employees. Operation
Triangulation exploited 4 zero days including an undocumented hardware
feature which allowed for an unprecedented level of access. The

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT IS A PARSER MISMATCH VULNERABILITY? (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post explains the class of vulnerabilities known as parser
mismatch vulnerabilities. These are caused by two systems parsing data
differently. This class of vulnerabilities includes vulnerabilities
such as HTTP Request Smuggling and URL parsing vulnerabilities.
Examples are included in the post. 

 AN INTRODUCTION TO BYPASSING USER MODE EDR HOOKS (10 MINUTE READ) [9]


 This post covers bypassing user mode EDR hooks. It begins with an
overview of syscalls and then explains how EDRs create user-mode
syscall hooks. The post gives an overview of methods to bypass EDR
hooks such as unhooking, manually mapping DLLs, direct syscalls, and
indirect syscalls. 

 CATCHING OPENSSL MISUSE USING CODEQL (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post walks through five different CodeQL queries that can be
used to catch potentially serious bugs in the OpenSSL libcrypto API
that can cause memory leaks, authentication bypasses, and other
cryptographic issues. It encourages developers and code reviewers to
use tools like CodeQL to build and share queries to secure their code.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GOD MODE RULES (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 The God Mode Security Rules Repository is dedicated to hosting ‚Äúgod
mode‚Äù rules that can detect as many threats as possible with minimal
false positives. It currently contains a YARA rule with a Sigma rule
in progress.

 GOOGLE SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER TRACKING PEOPLE IN 'INCOGNITO MODE' (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed in June 2020 that alleged
that the company misled users by tracking their surfing activity who
thought that their internet use remained private when using the
"incognito" or "private" mode on web browsers. The class-action
lawsuit sought at least $5 billion in damages. The settlement terms
were not disclosed. 

 DUAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION CHAIN: EXPLOITING MONITORING AND SERVICE
MESH CONFIGURATIONS AND PRIVILEGES IN GKE TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
IN KUBERNETES (10 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An attacker with access to a Kubernetes cluster can chain two
vulnerabilities in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to escalate
privileges and take over the cluster. The recently identified
vulnerabilities in FluentBit and ASM can be exploited as part of the
second stage of an attack, provided that the attacker has achieved
remote code execution in the FluentBit container or that they can
break out of another container. 

 THIS CLEVER NEW IDEA COULD FIX AIRTAG STALKING WHILE MAXIMIZING
PRIVACY (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In an effort to combat stalking, Apple modified its location privacy
system for AirTags by reducing the frequency of key rotations to allow
for better identification of malicious AirTags at a sacrifice of
privacy. Researchers have devised a cryptographic scheme that blends
secret sharing and error correction coding to better preserve user
privacy while also allowing for anti-stalking detection. The group of
researchers has proposed their scheme to a consortium of Apple,
Google, and other companies working on this issue.
