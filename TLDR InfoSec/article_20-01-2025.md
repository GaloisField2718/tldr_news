 PYTHON-BASED BOTS EXPLOITING PHP SERVERS FUEL GAMBLING PLATFORM
PROLIFERATION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a campaign targeting PHP
servers to promote gambling sites in Indonesia using Python-based
bots. The attacks involve the deployment of GSocket to exploit web
shells on servers running popular platforms like Moodle. Site owners
have been advised to update plugins, block rogue domains, and remove
suspicious accounts to defend against the malware. 

 MALICIOUS PYPI PACKAGE STEALS DISCORD AUTH TOKENS FROM DEVS (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A malicious PyPi package is attempting to squat the official Discord
Python library. The malicious package steals Discord auth tokens and
relays them to an external server as well as setting up a backdoor on
port 6969. The package is reportedly still available and was published
by a verified publisher account.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FINDING SSRFS IN AZURE DEVOPS (14 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Binary Security has identified three SSRF vulnerabilities in Azure
DevOps: an endpoint proxy vulnerability, a DNS rebinding bypass, and a
hooks SSRF with CRLF injection. 

 USING REKOR-MONITOR TO SCAN YOUR TRANSPARENCY LOGS (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Sigstore's Rekor provides a signature transparency log and Fulcio
provides a certificate transparency which can be used to enhance
auditability and discoverability of artifact metadata and code
signing. Rekor-monitor can be utilized for checking the consistency of
transparency logs or monitoring for compromised accounts. A demo is
included in the post. 

 BYPASSING DISK ENCRYPTION ON SYSTEMS WITH AUTOMATIC TPM2 UNLOCK (23
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 There is a significant security vulnerability in TPM2-based disk
encryption systems where an attacker with brief physical access can
bypass disk encryption on machines using systemd-cryptenroll or clevis
without a PIN. The vulnerability exists because most TPM2 unlock
setups fail to verify the LUKS identity of the decrypted partition,
allowing attackers to create a malicious partition that can extract
the original encryption key while maintaining the TPM state. This post
demonstrates successful attacks on both Fedora and NixOS systems. It
recommends either using a TPM PIN or implementing proper PCR 15
verification as mitigation strategies, though it notes that the latter
is not easily available on most distributions.

 OSV-SCALIBR (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SCALIBR (Software Composition Analysis Library) is an extensible file
system scanner used to extract software inventory data (e.g. installed
language packages) and detect vulnerabilities. It is a versatile file
system scanner that detects vulnerabilities and extracts software
inventory data. OSV-SCALIBR combines SCALIBR with OSV-scanner for
software inventory extraction and vulnerability scanning. It can be
used as a standalone tool, as a library for custom scans, or to
analyze container images. 

 COPYCAT (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Copycat is a library that helps intercept system calls in a more
efficient way on Linux systems 5.9 or higher. It offers faster
performance compared to traditional ptrace-based methods by utilizing
the SECCOMP Notifier API. Users can set rules for intercepting system
calls by defining source and destination mappings either through
environment variables or a configuration file.
