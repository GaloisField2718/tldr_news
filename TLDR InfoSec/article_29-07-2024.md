PROBABLY OVERPAYING FOR IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Manual penetration testing will only get you so far, and most
companies rarely find the time and resources to do it regularly.

vPenTest [4] is a SaaS platform [4] that fully replicates your manual
network pentesting ‚Äî from identifying sensitive data to attempting
privilege escalation. Also, it:

‚Üí costs 50% less [4] than manual testing,

‚Üí boosts testing frequency (monthly vs. annually), and

‚Üí ensures compliance and cyber liability insurance requirements with
detailed reports.

Get your free trial today [4] and go from spurious testing to
on-demand, affordable, and accurate pentesting that's easy for IT
teams to run.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MALICIOUS PYTHON PACKAGE TARGETS MACOS DEVELOPERS TO ACCESS THEIR GCP
ACCOUNTS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A Python package named "lr-utils-lib" was found to have hidden
malicious code targeting macOS systems to steal Google Cloud Platform
credentials. The malware sends harvested credentials to a remote
server and is linked to a fake LinkedIn profile, raising concerns
about social engineering tactics and AI verification challenges. This
incident highlights the importance of cybersecurity practices, such as
vetting third-party packages and critically evaluating information
from AI sources, in preventing potential security risks for
individuals and enterprises. 

 CRYPTO EXCHANGE GEMINI DISCLOSES THIRD-PARTY DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Gemini cryptocurrency exchange disclosed a data breach involving
banking information of some customers. The breach was caused by a
cyberattack on a third-party service provider. Gemini is advising
impacted individuals to stay vigilant and take measures to protect
their bank accounts from potential fraud. 

 CRITICAL BUG IN DOCKER ENGINE ALLOWED ATTACKERS TO BYPASS
AUTHORIZATION PLUGINS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical bug in Docker Engine lets attackers bypass authorization
plugins in certain versions by sending API requests with no content,
leading to potential unauthorized actions like privilege escalation.
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-41110, affects specific
versions of Docker Engine up to v27.1.0 and Docker Desktop up to
version 4.32.0. It can be mitigated by updating to the latest patched
versions, avoiding AuthZ plugins, and restricting access to the Docker
API.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAPPING THE ATTACK SURFACE FROM THE INSIDE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Mercari Security team discusses its process for creating a tool
to map an attack surface. The first iteration of the tool sought to
scan IaC for domains and scan them using the Burp Enterprise API. This
strategy failed, as their IaC did not contain all domains. The next
iteration involved directly querying asset inventories from AWS and
GCP and then spinning up a GCR task to utilize a Chromium browser to
take screenshots and then visualize the hostnames and IP addresses
found. 

 THREAT HUNTING - SUSPICIOUS NAMED PIPES (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post discusses how Named Pipes can be used by attackers for
Command and Control and how defenders like EDRs can detect these
usages. Attackers can exploit named pipes to move laterally within a
network. Monitoring named pipe creation and communication patterns can
help detect malicious activities.

 INTRODUCING SIGMA FILTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Sigma Filters are a new tool that helps Security Operations Centers
manage threat detection more effectively. They allow for the creation
of specific filters separate from detection rules, improving rule
management and reducing false positives. By using Sigma Filters, SOC
analysts can better tailor detection rules to their unique
environments and avoid detection evasion by attackers.

 BUILDING A SECURITY PLATFORM ENGINEERING TEAM (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Kane Narraway, a security manager at Canva, writes about the benefits
of a Security Platform Engineering team that can develop new solutions
to scale security as well as build secure-by-default systems with
other teams. Narraway reflects on the reality that in many
organizations, security engineers form this function as another part
of their role which can lead to complications when employees leave or
maintain the system. Narraway suggests that this function should come
after a security team is fully staffed and should ideally be composed
of at least two software engineers and a manager. 

 DAGGERFLY: ESPIONAGE GROUP MAKES MAJOR UPDATE TO TOOLSET (4 MINUTE

toolkit. Daggerfly is a sophisticated espionage group with a wide
range of tools targeting various operating systems and the ability to
quickly update its toolset to evade detection.
