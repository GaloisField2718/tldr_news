 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Phishing has gone beyond email. Today's attackers use AI-generated
voices, videos, and interactive deepfakes of company executives. They
can fool almost anyone - including you and your coworkers.

Backed by $55M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z, Adaptive Security is
the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered social
engineering [4]. Adaptive keeps employees on their feet with tools
such as:

 	* Deepfake phishing simulations of company executives in real-world
attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, customizable training content tailored for each
employee (500+ resources)
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that factors in your publicly available
data adversaries can exploit

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CISA SOUNDS ALARM ON CRITICAL SUDO FLAW ACTIVELY EXPLOITED IN LINUX
AND UNIX SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CISA added CVE-2025-32463, a critical sudo vulnerability with a CVSS
score of 9.3, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to
evidence of active exploitation in the wild. The flaw affects sudo
versions before 1.9.17p1 and allows local attackers to leverage the
--chroot option to execute arbitrary commands as root, even without
sudoers file permissions. Federal agencies must patch by October 20,
while organizations should immediately update sudo to version 1.9.17p1
or later to prevent privilege escalation attacks. 

 JAPAN'S LARGEST BREWER SUSPENDS OPERATIONS DUE TO CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Asahi Group Holdings, Japan's leading brewery with $20 billion in
revenue and holding a third of the market, experienced a cyberattack
that disrupted ordering, shipping, call centers, and customer service.
The incident, which began at 7 AM and impacted only Japan, did not
result in confirmed data leaks, although investigations are ongoing,
and no group has claimed responsibility. Companies should enhance
their business continuity plans, adopt network segmentation, and
develop incident response strategies to manage disruptions, including
communication with customers and partners. 

 TILE'S LACK OF ENCRYPTION COULD MAKE TRACKER OWNERS VULNERABLE TO
STALKING (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Security flaws in Tile's tracking devices have raised concerns about
user vulnerability. Researchers found that these devices lack proper
encryption and fail to adequately rotate identification details,
making them easily exploitable for stalking and tracking purposes.
Despite noting recent improvements, Tile's approach falls short
compared to other brands, as anti-theft features can be abused, and
privacy remains at risk for users relying on the technology.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 COHERENCE: INSIDER RISK STRATEGY'S NEW CORE PRINCIPLE (7 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 This article proposes "coherence" as a new foundational principle for
insider risk management, arguing that traditional control and
surveillance approaches fail because they don't address human
alignment and organizational meaning. The author identifies "drift" -
gradual detachment from purpose and clarity - as an early warning
signal that precedes both malicious actions and human errors,
manifesting through compliance without conviction, corporate messaging
noise, and reduced employee initiative. Security professionals should
focus on building semantic consistency in messaging, creating feedback
channels to detect narrative drift, partnering cross-functionally to
align organizational language, and treating coherence as operational
infrastructure rather than just cultural enhancement. 

 ABUSING NOTION'S AI AGENT FOR DATA THEFT (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Notion's AI agents are susceptible to prompt injection attacks
exploiting Simon Willson's 'lethal trifecta'—access to private data,
exposure to untrusted content, and external communication. Attackers
can embed malicious instructions in PDFs with white text instructing
AI to extract and exfiltrate confidential data through web searches to
attacker-controlled URLs. Security professionals should evaluate AI
deployments carefully, as current systems lack effective defenses
against such attacks, and organizations should enforce strict data
access and network controls for sensitive AI systems. 

 FIRST MALICIOUS MCP IN THE WILD: THE POSTMARK BACKDOOR THAT'S
STEALING YOUR EMAILS (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 MCP servers, designed to help AI assistants automate tasks like
sending emails, can pose significant security risks if abused.
Recently, a popular npm package called postmark-mcp was discovered to
be exfiltrating emails—including sensitive content like password
resets and confidential memos—to a remote server controlled by its
developer. The backdoor was introduced in a single line of code within
an otherwise trustworthy tool, highlighting how quickly legitimate
infrastructure can become compromised.

 SAFEHILL EMERGES FROM STEALTH WITH $2.6 MILLION PRE-SEED FUNDING (2
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Chicago-based SafeHill (formerly Tacticly) emerged from stealth with
$2.6 million in pre-seed funding, notable for having reformed LulzSec
leader Hector Monsegur (aka Sabu) as chief research officer. The
company offers SecureIQ, a continuous threat exposure management
platform that combines AI-driven penetration testing with human
validation to provide continuous asset discovery, automated threat
assessments, and real-time monitoring. Security teams can leverage
this hybrid approach for ongoing penetration testing, rather than
conducting point-in-time traditional evaluations, with compliance
mapping for frameworks such as PCI-DSS, CMMC, and ISO27001. 

 MALIFISCAN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 MalifiScan is a security tool that identifies and blocks malicious
packages before they compromise your software supply chain. It
monitors vulnerability databases, such as OSV, for new malicious
packages and scans your registries and repositories for existing
threats. When used with platforms like JFrog Artifactory, it automates
exclusion patterns to prevent future downloads of flagged packages,
ensuring secure dependencies across development pipelines. 

 CODE PATHFINDER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Code Pathfinder, the open-source alternative to GitHub CodeQL, was
built with GoLang. Built for advanced structural search, derive
insights, and find vulnerabilities in code.

 E-COMMERCE FRAUD-AS-A-SERVICE: HOW SCAMMERS EXPLOIT BRAND TRUST AT
SCALE (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cybercriminals target e-commerce brands through three primary
fraud-as-a-service operations: credential phishing via fake login
pages promoted on Facebook and Instagram, fraudulent storefronts that
offer fake deals to harvest payment data, and fake job campaigns for
work-from-home scams. These attacks utilize Phishing-as-a-Service
platforms that simplify the deployment of sophisticated scams, even
for non-technical actors, targeting mobile users to evade detection.
Organizations should monitor their brand with Google Alerts, educate
customers about official sites, deploy Digital Risk Protection tools
to detect phishing setups, and establish rapid response procedures for
takedown requests and evidence collection. 

 'TRIFECTA' OF GEMINI FLAWS TURN AI INTO ATTACK VEHICLE (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Google's Gemini AI suite had three critical flaws: Search
Personalization enabled injection and data leaks via Chrome history,
Cloud Assist allowed prompt manipulation through raw logs, and the
Browsing Tool exposed saved data through a side channel. All
vulnerabilities could be exploited for data exfiltration. Google has
now fixed them. 

 SVG PHISHING HITS UKRAINE WITH AMATERA STEALER, PUREMINER (7 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 A phishing campaign targeting Ukrainian organizations has emerged
using emails disguised as official notices from the country's police.
These emails contain SVG attachments that trigger fileless attacks
when opened, deploying malware including Amatera Stealer and
PureMiner. The SVG initiates a download chain using password-protected
files that ultimately execute malicious code via in-memory,
process-hollowing techniques. The Amatera Stealer collects sensitive
information and credentials, while PureMiner hijacks victim resources
for cryptocurrency mining. Both can then install additional malware.
