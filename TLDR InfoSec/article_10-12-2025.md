 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's phishing attacks involve AI-generated voices, videos, and
interactive deepfakes of company executives. They fool 99% of people.

Adaptive Security - backed by $65M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z -
is the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered
social engineering [4]. Adaptive trains your team with tools that stay
one step ahead:

 	* Deepfake attack simulations featuring your real executives in
realistic attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, personalized training content tailored for each
employee
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that reveals what attackers can learn from
your public data

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 70 DOMAINS USED IN MONTHS-LONG PHISHING SPREE AGAINST US
UNIVERSITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A coordinated phishing campaign that ran from April to November
targeted at least 18 US universities using approximately 70 domains
and the Evilginx adversary-in-the-middle toolkit. Attackers sent
personalized emails containing TinyURL-shortened links that
impersonated university SSO portals to steal MFA-bypassing session
cookies. UC Santa Cruz, UC Santa Barbara, University of San Diego,
Virginia Commonwealth University, and University of Michigan were
among the most heavily targeted. Recommended mitigations include
adopting phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn) and monitoring
unusual session cookie behavior. 

 OVER 300,000 INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY VITAS HOSPICE DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Vitas Healthcare, the largest US for-profit hospice chain, reported
that a compromised vendor account was used to access its systems from
late September to late October, exposing data belonging to over
300,000 current and former patients. Exposed information includes
contact details, identification numbers, Social Security numbers,
medical and insurance data, and next-of-kin contacts. No ransomware
group has claimed responsibility. 

 IVANTI WARNS OF CRITICAL ENDPOINT MANAGER CODE EXECUTION FLAW (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ivanti disclosed a critical vulnerability in its Endpoint Manager
(EPM) platform that allows unauthenticated attackers with access to
the EPM web service to register fake endpoints and inject malicious
JavaScript into the administrative dashboard. Ivanti also patched
three additional high-severity vulnerabilities, including two that
could enable unauthenticated remote code execution on arbitrary
systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SYSMON CONFIG CREATION FOR THE LOLRMM FRAMEWORK (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A security researcher released a Sysmon configuration tailored to
detect Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools listed in the
LOLRMM framework. The rules cover process creation, file operations,
network activity, and DNS queries, derived from behavioral analysis of
RMM installers executed in VirusTotal, Hybrid-Analysis, and Any.run
sandboxes. By capturing file paths, registry keys, and network
indicators, the configuration helps security teams spot unauthorized
RMM activity even when binaries are renamed or obfuscated. 

 PROMPT INJECTION IS NOT SQL INJECTION (IT MAY BE WORSE) (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The UK NCSC explains that prompt injection fundamentally differs from
SQL injection because LLMs do not separate instructions from data,
they simply predict tokens. As a result, techniques like parameterized
queries cannot fully mitigate prompt injection. The agency recommends
treating LLMs as "inherently confusable deputies" and implementing
deterministic guardrails that constrain system actions outside of the
model rather than relying on input filtering. Effective defenses
include enforcing least privilege for LLM-driven workflows, closely
monitoring tool and API usage, and acknowledging that prompt injection
remains a residual architectural risk. 

 RISK-BASED ALERTING IN MICROSOFT SENTINEL (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) allows analysts to combine multiple
lower-fidelity alerts into a single higher-confidence incident by
assigning risk scores to alerts that do not individually generate
incidents. An incident is only created once a cumulative risk
threshold is met. When assigning scores, teams should weigh potential
impact, the criticality of the asset or user involved, and the
confidence that the behavior reflects real malicious activity. This
approach can reduce alert fatigue and improve triage efficiency.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 RESEMBLE AI INTRODUCES NEW DEEPFAKE DETECTION MODEL FOR VOICE, IMAGE,
AND VIDEO (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated and now span voice, image,
and video. Resemble AI's DETECT-3B Omni [13] gives security teams a
way to fight back: this multimodal AI model was trained on 3 billion
parameters to deliver unified deepfake protection across all content
types, with a benchmark-beating 94-99% accuracy. Read the detailed
breakdown [14] 

 CVE POC SEARCH (WEBSITE) [15] 

 This tool provides a streamlined interface for searching
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code associated with specific CVEs.
Rather than serving as a vulnerability database, it aggregates and
directs users to underlying PoC sources, making it useful for quickly
locating exploit references for testing, validation, or workflow
integration. 

 IMPER AI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 Imper.ai provides real-time detection and prevention of impersonation
and social engineering attacks across video, voice, phone, and chat
communications. 

 CRACKFTP (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 CrackFtp is a mass FTP checker and cracker designed to test login
credentials and alert on successful logins to secure domains with
Telegram notifications.

MISCELLANEOUS

 THE CURIOUS CASE OF TWIN HACKERS ACCUSED OF ERASING US GOVERNMENT
DATABASES (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Twin brothers Muneeb and Sohaib Akhter, federal contractors
previously convicted of hacking in 2015, were arrested for allegedly
deleting nearly 100 government databases containing FOIA records and
sensitive investigative files. After learning of their termination
from Opexus, the pair allegedly used still-active credentials to
access systems. Authorities say Muneeb also stole IRS tax records of
450 individuals and attempted to erase evidence via AI-assisted log
deletion queries. The case underscores the need for immediate
credential revocation on termination, rigorous vetting for privileged
roles, and strong backup strategies. 

 DANGEROUS INVITATIONS: RUSSIAN THREAT ACTOR SPOOFS EUROPEAN SECURITY
EVENTS IN TARGETED PHISHING ATTACKS (6 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Russian threat actor UTA0355 impersonated multiple prominent European
security conferences, including the Belgrade Security Conference and
Brussels Indo-Pacific Dialogue, to harvest Microsoft 365 credentials.
The attackers created convincing replica websites and abused OAuth and
Device Code authentication flows. They used rapport-building outreach
on WhatsApp and Signal, leveraged compromised accounts for
credibility, and selectively triggered credential theft based on
targeted email domains. Defenses include user training on OAuth
consent prompts, monitoring anomalous device registrations in Entra
ID, and enforcing conditional access controls. 

 RESEARCHERS SPOT 700% INCREASE IN HYPERVISOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Security researchers report a 700% increase in ransomware attacks
targeting hypervisors like Hyper-V and VMWare ESXi, with groups such
as Akira leading the trend. Hypervisors often lack endpoint-style
protections and offer attackers a control point over numerous VMs
simultaneously. Attacks abuse built‑in tools to encrypt VM storage
and misuse management utilities to disable protections.
