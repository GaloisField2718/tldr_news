ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AT&T NOT SURE IF NEW CUSTOMER DATA DUMP IS DÉJÀ VU (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 AT&T is investigating claims that 86 million customer records,
reportedly containing birthdates, phone numbers, addresses, and 44
million social security numbers, are being sold on cybercrime forums.
The company says this appears to be repackaged data from previous
breaches, possibly the 2024 Snowflake incident or an earlier 2021
theft, rather than a new hack. 

 'PATHWIPER' ATTACK HITS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN UKRAINE (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Cisco Talos discovered "PathWiper," a new Russian wiper malware
targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure through legitimate
endpoint administration frameworks. Unlike previous wipers, PathWiper
programmatically identifies all connected drives and network paths via
APIs before overwriting data with random bytes, potentially more
destructive than tools like HermeticWiper used in earlier attacks. 

 LARGEST EVER DATA LEAK EXPOSES OVER 4B RECORDS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered an open 613GB database containing over 4
billion records. The database contained numerous data collections,
including an 805M record database of WeChat records, a 780M record
database of addresses and geographic data, banking information, and
MFA devices. However, the researchers could not analyze the dataset
comprehensively as it was taken down soon after discovery.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VIBE CODING IS HERE TO STAY. CAN IT EVER BE SECURE? (7 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 AI tools are making it easier and faster for people to write code,
even with little experience. However, many experts worry that this
“vibe coding” approach will pose serious security risks. While AI
coding grows fast, it still struggles to make safe and reliable
software. 

 BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE CHECK LIST (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A Business Email Compromise (BEC) incident response checklist for
Office 365 outlines four phases: isolate the compromised account,
contain the threat by resetting credentials and removing unauthorized
configurations, eradicate traces of the attacker, and assess impact by
reviewing sent emails and shared files. The response includes
immediate actions like disabling accounts and changing passwords,
followed by forensic analysis, stakeholder notification, and required
regulatory reporting. Prevention through proper security measures is
easier than incident response, but organizations must learn from
incidents to strengthen defenses. 

 THE COST OF A CALL: FROM VOICE PHISHING TO DATA EXTORTION (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reports on threat activity
from a group tracked as UNC6040. The group uses vishing to impersonate
IT support personnel in convincing attacks targeting employees in
multinational corporations into granting access or sharing credentials
to their Salesforce platform. In many campaigns, the threat actors
convince the victim to add a modified version of the bulk data import
tool, Salesforce Data Loader, which is modified to send the data to an
attacker-controlled infrastructure.

 ITALIAN LAWMAKERS SAY ITALY USED SPYWARE TO TARGET PHONES OF
IMMIGRATION ACTIVISTS, BUT NOT AGAINST JOURNALIST (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 An Italian parliamentary investigation confirmed that the government
used Paragon's Graphite spyware to lawfully target activists involved
in rescuing Mediterranean immigrants. However, the committee found no
evidence that Italian agencies targeted journalist Francesco
Cancellato, who received WhatsApp breach notifications. Thus,
questions about who was responsible for surveilling the prominent
investigative reporter remain unanswered. 

 MANDIANT FLAGS FAKE AI VIDEO GENERATORS LACED WITH MALWARE (2 MINUTE
READ) [16]

spread by advertising free access to popular AI video generators such
as Luma AI, Canva Dream Lab, and Kling AI. After the user inputs a
prompt, they are served with one of the static malicious payloads that
the site hosts.
