ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RANSOMWARE GROUP TARGETS FOXCONN SUBSIDIARY FOXSEMICON (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Foxsemicon, a subsidiary of Foxconn, was recently targeted by the
ransomware group LockBit. The hackers defaced Foxsemicon's website,
claimed to steal 5TB of data, and are threatening to leak sensitive
customer/employee info unless their ransom demand is paid. 

 LEFTOVERLOCALS: LISTENING TO LLM RESPONSES THROUGH LEAKED GPU LOCAL
MEMORY (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Trail of Bits is disclosing a vulnerability that it discovered that
allows for memory leakage from an optimized GPU region in GPUs from
Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, and Imagination. The researchers showed that
they could leak 5.5MB per GPU invocation, which translates to 181MB on
a 7B llama.cpp model. They demonstrated that this is enough
information to reconstruct the LLM response with high accuracy. 

 ANDROXGHOST MALWARE BOTNET STEALS AWS, MICROSOFT CREDENTIALS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CISA and FBI warn that threat actors using Androxghost malware are
building a botnet focused on cloud credential theft and using the
stolen information to deliver additional malicious payloads. The
botnet scans for servers vulnerable to specific RCE vulnerabilities
and then scans the servers for .env files with cloud credentials. The
credentials can then be used to spin up infrastructure to expand the
botnet or to send out spam masquerading as the compromised companies.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LATERAL MOVEMENT ‚Äì VISUAL STUDIO DTE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Visual Studio's Development Tools Environment (DTE) COM library can
enable lateral movement by interacting with the OS to execute commands
remotely. The class ID of the Visual Studio install needs to be
retrieved from the registry first, but it is an interesting path that
can be taken. 

 REAL TIME THREAT DETECTION FOR KUBERNETES WITH ATOMIC RED TESTS &
FALCO (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A post on using Atomic Red Tests to test Falco detection in
Kubernetes. The post first walks through deploying Atomic Red Tests
and Falco in a Kubernetes cluster. It then walks through running
tests, monitoring for detections, and adding custom Falco rules for
missed events. 

 A LIGHTWEIGHT METHOD TO DETECT POTENTIAL IOS MALWARE (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This blog post discusses a lightweight way to detect potential iOS
malware by analyzing the Shutdown.log file stored in sysdiag archives.
Anomalies and indicators of malware can be detected by extracting and
parsing the log file. In the example presented in the post, through
analysis of several Pegasus malware infections, it was discovered that
the Shutdown.log file contained traces of infection.
