 PREVENT PHISHING AND TOKEN THEFT ON MICROSOFT 36 WITH IP-BASED
RESTRICTIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 You can't control what users click on. When they're distracted or in
a rush, they might give attackers red carpet access that bypasses
every well-crafted control in your Microsoft 365 environment.

✋ Stop phishing, token theft, and email compromise attacks with
ThreatLocker Cloud Control [4]. Here's how it works:

 	* You install the ThreatLocker Agent / MDS on users' laptops /
phones
 	* ThreatLocker automatically tracks and learns trusted IP addresses
from protected devices, and builds a dynamic allowlist [4] of
legitimate connection points.
 	* When attackers attempt to use stolen credentials or hijacked
tokens, they're blocked because their IP isn't recognized.

✅ No match. No entry. Simple as that.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 UPDATE VMWARE TOOLS: HACKERS CAN TAMPER WITH VIRTUAL MACHINES (1
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers can exploit a vulnerability in VMware Tools to tamper with
virtual machines. Broadcom has released patches to fix the issue,
which affects Windows and Linux versions 12.x.x and 11.x.x. Users are
urged to apply the fixed version 12.5.2 to secure their virtual
machines. 

 SECURITY FIRM ANDY FRAIN SAYS 100,000 PEOPLE IMPACTED BY RANSOMWARE
ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Security company Andy Frain Services reported a data breach affecting
over 100,000 people. Discovered in October 2024, the Black Basta
ransomware group claimed responsibility, allegedly stealing 750GB of
sensitive files. Impacted individuals are being offered credit
monitoring and identity restoration services. 

 ATTACKERS PWN CHARTER AIRLINE HELPING TRUMP'S DEPORTATION CAMPAIGN (3

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANALYSIS OF APT37 ATTACK CASE DISGUISED AS A THINK TANK FOR NATIONAL
SECURITY STRATEGY IN SOUTH KOREA (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The APT37 threat actor from North Korea launched a March 2025 spear
phishing campaign, posing as a South Korean national security think
tank, which delivered malicious LNK files via Dropbox that ultimately
installed the RoKRAT backdoor. Dubbed "Operation: ToyBox Story," the
attack employed fileless malware techniques to evade detection, with
the RoKRAT backdoor capturing screenshots and system info before
encrypting and exfiltrating data to cloud-based command servers. The
attackers utilized legitimate cloud services (Dropbox, pCloud, and
Yandex) as C2 infrastructure and Russian Yandex email addresses,
specifically targeting activists focused on North Korea. 

 A PYTHON IN DISGUISE: UNPACKING PYINSTALLER MALWARE ON MACOS (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Attackers use PyInstaller to package malicious Python code into
standalone Mach-O executables for macOS, eliminating the need for
Python installation. This attack involves bundling obfuscated
infostealer code (string reversal, base85 encoding, XOR encryption,
and zlib compression) that extracts credentials from password prompts,
executes malicious AppleScript, steals from the keychain, and targets
cryptocurrency wallets. Upon execution, these binaries create
temporary directories with the extracted Python libraries and
malicious code, which exist only during the malware's runtime. 

 FAKE GIF LEVERAGED IN MULTI-STAGE REVERSE-PROXY CARD SKIMMING ATTACK
(7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post examines a sophisticated card-stealing malware that
exploited a vulnerability in an outdated Magento eCommerce site. The
first stage of the malware injects obfuscated JS onto every page that
loads a PHP script, which masquerades as a GIF and sets up a reverse
proxy to intercept all requests before modifying the responses to hide
its activity and planting a trigger in the user's User Agent. A second
tampered file, onestepcheckout[.]phtml, loads the payload out of the
User Agent into sessionStorage, and if the trigger is detected, the
onestepcheckout injection detonates on the checkout page.

 MARKS & SPENCER CONFIRMS CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL DATA WAS STOLEN IN HACK
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 During a recent cyberattack, Marks & Spencer confirmed that hackers
stole customer data, including names, dates of birth, addresses, phone
numbers, and order histories. The retailer is resetting passwords

 AN OPEN LETTER TO THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Patrick Opet, CISO of JPMorgan Chase, penned an open letter
addressing the increasing prevalence of SaaS as the preferred or
exclusive method of distributing third-party software. Opet
highlighted issues where third-party suppliers prioritize new features
to compete with their competitors over security and where
authentication and authorization are blurring together, leading to
architectural vulnerabilities and hidden dependencies that the vendors
themselves use. He calls on third parties to prioritize security and
calls upon practitioners to push back against solutions that do not do
so. 

 AMAZON COGNITO NOW SUPPORTS REFRESH TOKEN ROTATION (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Amazon Cognito has announced the release of a new feature that allows
customers on the Essentials or Plus tiers to configure automatic
refresh token rotation for user pool clients. Before this feature,
customers had to choose between long-lived tokens to reduce user
friction at the cost of reduced security or short-lived tokens that
were more secure but required users to reauthenticate more frequently.
