VULNERABILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Morphisec discovered an unauthenticated, zero-click (for trusted
senders) RCE vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook. It has warned that
this vulnerability could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access,
and other malicious activities if abused. A patch for the
vulnerability was included in July's Patch Tuesday patches. The
researchers will be presenting more technical details at DEFCON. 

 CRITICAL CISCO BUG LETS HACKERS ADD ROOT USERS ON SEG DEVICES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cisco has fixed a critical vulnerability that allows hackers to add
root users and crash SEG devices using malicious email attachments.
The flaw involves an absolute path traversal weakness in SEG content
scanning, enabling attackers to replace files on the system. Cisco
advises updating vulnerable appliances to prevent exploitation and
contacting its Technical Assistance Center for assistance. 

CROWDSTRIKE UPDATE CAUSES MAJOR IT OUTAGE, TAKING OUT BANKS, AIRLINES,
AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE WORLD (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

Businesses all over the world, from hospitals to banks and other
companies, are reporting IT outages. Microsoft started noting issues
on its Service Health page in the early hours of today. Shortly
thereafter, outages became widespread. CrowdStrike says that a faulty
update is causing crashes in Windows systems - Mac and Linux devices
are unaffected. The issue stems from invalidly formatted .sys files
causing the top level driver to crash. Recovery will be very
difficult.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ARE MY AWS RESOURCES ENCRYPTED OR UNENCRYPTED BY DEFAULT? (5 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Fog Security investigated 51 different AWS resources and found that
only 76% of them were encrypted by default, with 22 of those being
encrypted with AWS Owned Keys by default. Even when encrypted by
default, services that used AWS Owned Keys were shared between AWS
accounts and don't typically offer more access controls. AWS Managed
Keys are controlled by AWS and typically implicitly grant access to
IAM principals in the same account, so they may offer less protection
than expected. Fog Security recommends enabling encryption by default
where possible and also opting for the use of AWS Customer Managed
Keys where possible. 

 HOW TO ANALYZE MALICIOUS MSI INSTALLER FILES (18 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post discusses in detail how to analyze malicious MSI files
used for software installation on Windows. MSI installers can hide
malicious code within legitimate packages to avoid detection by
security tools. Threat actors often use custom actions in MSI files to
execute harmful code during installation. 

 LEVERAGING AUTOMATED FIRMWARE ANALYSIS WITH THE OPEN-SOURCE FIRMWARE
ANALYZER EMBA (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This blog post discusses how automated firmware analysis tools like
EMBA enhance security by scanning for vulnerabilities in device
firmware. EMBA's open-source approach allows for deep analysis,
detection of unknown threats, and customized testing. Leveraging EMBA
can significantly improve product security, protect critical devices,
and streamline the firmware analysis process.
