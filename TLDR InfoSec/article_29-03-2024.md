STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANALYSIS OF THE MOBOX SECURITY BREACH (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The MOBOX decentralized lending protocol was attacked on March 14,
leading to losses of $750,000. The attack was possible because of a
vulnerability in the logic of the contract‚Äôs borrow() function that
allowed the attacker to burn the pool‚Äôs currency which drove up the
price while the attacker claimed referral rewards to use for more
borrowing. The team recommends that similar lending protocols
implement lock-up period restrictions to prevent these attacks. 

 DISSECTING A COMPLEX VULNERABILITY AND ACHIEVING ARBITRARY CODE
EXECUTION IN ICHITARO WORD (52 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This research document by Cisco Talos details a complex vulnerability
in Ichitaro Word that leads to arbitrary code execution. The exploit
achieves a frame pointer overwrite by exploiting an out-of-bounds
index, enabling the construction of powerful exploitation primitives
for full code execution. This detailed document provides a good
walkthrough on how to approach similar reverse engineering problems to
find vulnerabilities in software. 

 HOW APPLE MITIGATES VULNERABILITIES IN INSTALLER SCRIPTS (22 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Installer Scripts are valuable targets for attackers as they give
processes and their children access to areas in the system that are
protected by System Integrity Protection. This article details how
vulnerabilities have bypassed these protections in the past. It
provides an in-depth look at PackageKit, which is designed to
eliminate this full class of vulnerabilities.

 DIVING DEEPER INTO AI PACKAGE HALLUCINATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AI Package Hallucination exploits LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini to
spread non-existent, potentially malicious packages through
recommendations. Extensive testing on the GPT-3.5 Turbo model with 457
questions across 40 subjects in two programming languages revealed a
concerning 30% hallucination rate. 

 A LOOK AT SOFTWARE COMPOSITION ANALYSIS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Doyensec published a whitepaper on the results of testing Snyk,
Dependabot, and Semgrep for SCA. The goal of the test was to find
which tool had the highest true positive rate with the lowest false
positive rate, while ignoring false negative rate. The test found that
Dependabot had the highest true positive rate but also the highest
false positive rate while Semgrep had the second highest true positive
rate and the lowest false positive rate.
