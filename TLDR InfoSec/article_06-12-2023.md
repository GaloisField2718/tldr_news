STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MICROSOFT CYBERSECURITY REFERENCE ARCHITECTURES (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA) are shared
as part of the Security Adoption Framework. This post describes how
Microsoft's cybersecurity capabilities integrate with their own and
third party platforms. The resource includes information on
antipatterns, best practices, and threat trends, among other topics.
It also includes detailed technical diagrams for various aspects of
cybersecurity. 

 PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE OF AWS RESOURCES (10 MINUTE READ) [10]


 Part 1 of an ongoing series of blog posts that focuses on preventing
accidental exposure of AWS resources. This post provides an overview
of the exposure risks associated with VPC-based resources and provides
different options to prevent accidental exposure. It concludes with a
table detailing the different tradeoffs with each option. 

 DETECTING AITM PHISHING SITES WITH FUZZY HASHING (3 MINUTE READ) [11]


 This blog post explains how Obsidian detects phishing kits or
Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) websites for its customers by analyzing
the fuzzy hashes of visited website content. The fuzzy hashing
approach provides companies with another way of catching commoditized
or targeted phishing attacks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HUMBLE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A humble and fast security-oriented HTTP headers analyzer. 

 IMDSPOOF (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 IMDSpoof is a tool that spoofs the AWS IMDS service running on an EC2
instance. The tool spoofs the security-credentials IMDS endpoint and
redirects it to a local webserver. This webserver can utilize Thinkst
Canary HoneyTokens to alert on user access. 

 COPACETIC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Copacetic can be used to quickly patch a container without going
upstream for rebuild based on vulnerabilities. This can be used to
shorten incident response times because the time from vulnerability
announcement to active exploitation continues to narrow.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MICROSOFT CONFIRMS WINDOWS BUG RENAMES PRINTERS TO HP LASERJET
M101-M106 (2 MINUTE READ) [15]

 15,000 GO MODULE REPOSITORIES ON GITHUB VULNERABLE TO REPOJACKING
ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Security research firm Vulncheck claims that 15,000 Go module
repositories on GitHub are vulnerable to an attack called repojacking,
where bad actors take advantage of account username changes and
deletions to create repositories with the same name and stage
open-source software supply chain attacks. These repositories account
for at least 800,000 Go module-versions. 

 IAM ACCESS ANALYZER ADDS UNUSED ACCESS AND CUSTOM POLICY CHECKS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AWS IAM Access Analyzer has added a new analyzer to continuously
