 WHAT THREAT ACTORS ARE SAYING ABOUT AI: AN ANALYSIS OF +100K ILLICIT
SOURCES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Flashpoint analyzed 2.6M+ AI-related posts from underground sources
[4] (such as dark web forums and Telegram groups). Their analysis
revelas how threat actors are operationalizing everything from
jailbroken LLMs to deepfake-as-a-service.

This new guide [4] breaks down:

 	* How adversaries are weaponizing AI tools—from custom fraud
models to multilingual phishing kits
 	* 5 distinct threat actor use cases that defenders should know
 	* AI-enhanced defense workflows that improve detection speed and
sharpen investigations
 	* Common AI pitfalls such automation overreach, blind trust in
models, and losing human context

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ROWHAMMER ATTACK DEMONSTRATED AGAINST NVIDIA GPU (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A group of researchers from the University of Toronto demonstrated
that the Rowhammer attack method can be applied to GPUs in an attack
they dubbed GPUHammer. Rowhammer attacks involve repeatedly accessing
(“hammering”) a DRAM row, leading to electrical interference that
causes bit flips in adjacent memory regions. The researchers have
demonstrated that GPUHammer attacks can reduce the accuracy of ML
models from 80% to 0.1%. 

 MCDONALD'S CHATBOT RECRUITMENT PLATFORM EXPOSED 64 MILLION JOB
APPLICATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 McDonald's chatbot recruitment platform, McHire, exposed the personal
data of over 64 million job applicants due to default credentials
('123456' username/password) and an insecure API. Security researchers
accessed all applicant information, including names, addresses, phone
numbers, and chat messages. 

 OVER 600 LARAVEL APPS EXPOSED TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION DUE TO LEAKED
APP_KEYS ON GITHUB (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cybersecurity researchers discovered that leaked Laravel APP_KEYs
from GitHub can enable remote code execution attacks. Over 260,000
APP_KEYs were extracted from GitHub, with more than 600 vulnerable
applications identified. When attackers obtain these encryption keys,
they can exploit deserialization flaws to execute arbitrary code on
servers, compromising data and infrastructure security.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GROK-4 JAILBREAK WITH ECHO CHAMBER AND CRESCENDO (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers have shown that combining two LLM jailbreak techniques,
Echo Chamber and Crescendo, enhances the ability to bypass AI safety
measures more effectively than using either method separately.
Experiments with Grok-4 on harmful tasks, like providing bomb-making
instructions, achieved success rates ranging from 30% to 67%. 

 ROLLING OUT SANTA WITHOUT FREEZING PRODUCTIVITY: TIPS FROM SECURING
FIGMA'S FLEET (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Figma successfully deployed Santa, an open-source binary
authorization tool, across all employee laptops by running it in
monitoring mode for months to build a comprehensive allowlist based on
actual usage patterns. It minimized user disruption through a custom
Slack-based self-service system that allows employees to quickly
approve blocked applications after automated security checks, as well
as an escape hatch that enables temporary monitoring mode during
rollout. The phased deployment began with users having zero unknown
binaries and gradually expanded to 100% coverage over three months,
utilizing automated package rule generation and group-based policies
to handle edge cases, such as developer tools. 

 HOW I FOUND A BYPASS IN GOOGLE'S BIG ANTI-ADBLOCK UPDATE (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The author discovered a Chrome bug that allowed MV3 extensions to
bypass Google's removal of webRequestBlocking (which kills adblockers)
by exploiting legacy JavaScript bindings and creating fake webRequest
events with spoofed WebView IDs. The exploit worked by using the
constructor of existing webRequest events to create new events with
the opt_webViewInstanceId parameter set, which skipped permission
checks for webRequestBlocking since the browser never verified if the
extension had WebView permissions. Google patched the vulnerability in
Chrome 118 by adding proper permission validation, although it didn't
award a bounty since it didn't expose new data to extensions.

 84% OF ENTERPRISES HIT BY API SECURITY INCIDENTS, NEW STUDY REVEALS
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Akamai's new 2024 study of 1,200+ CIOs, CISOs, and security
professionals reveals 84% of enterprises experienced API security
incidents. The research examines how incidents impact profits, damage
credibility, and where gaps exist in API inventories and testing.

 The cloud-based email security solution leverages AI to scan emails
for threats such as impersonation, spoofing, spear-phishing, and
business email compromise. 

 CAMERADAR (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Cameradar hacks its way into RTSP video surveillance cameras as it is
a tool that scans for RTSP camera streams, identifies device models,
performs dictionary attacks to find stream routes and credentials,
then generates a comprehensive report. 

 RECONSNAP (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 The platform enables automated digital change detection, capturing
visual and structural changes on selected targets. This helps you
track updates, detect anomalies, and react to potential threats before
others.

 GOOGLE GEMINI FOR WORKSPACE HIJACKS EMAIL SUMMARIES FOR PHISHING (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A security researcher discovered an indirect prompt-injection attack
on Google's Gemini model. The prompt injection attack involves
including invisible instructions for Gemini in emails. When a user
then uses Google Gemini for Workspace to summarize the email, Gemini
will follow the instructions and may include phishing links or
misinformation in its summary. 

 “LOCALHOST TRACKING” EXPLAINED. IT COULD COST META 32 BILLION (12
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Meta deployed “localhost tracking” that bypassed Android security
protections by using its mobile apps to listen on local network ports
while tracking scripts in web browsers sent user identifiers via
WebRTC, linking anonymous browsing activity to real Facebook/Instagram
identities even when users employed VPNs, incognito mode, and deleted
cookies. The scheme affected 22% of the world's most visited websites
and collected complete browsing histories, purchases, and behavioral
patterns without proper consent across billions of users over multiple
years. Meta now faces potential fines of €32 billion under GDPR,
DSA, and DMA regulations for violating data protection, personalized
advertising restrictions, and rules governing the combination of
cross-platform data. 

 SMM CALLOUT VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED IN GIGABYTE UEFI FIRMWARE
MODULES (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Four SMM callout vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-7026 through
CVE-2025-7029) were found in Gigabyte UEFI firmware, allowing
attackers with admin privileges to execute code in System Management
Mode, bypassing OS protections and potentially disabling Secure Boot
and Intel BootGuard. These flaws result from improper validation of
CPU registers and pointers in SMI handlers, enabling malicious control
over SMRAM writes and flash operations. Although they were previously
fixed by AMI, these issues reappeared in Gigabyte's firmware, so users
should urgently update to the latest UEFI from Gigabyte's support
site.
