 COMPARING SEMGREP VS. APPSEC ALTERNATIVES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Independent reviewers confirm that using Semgrep can cut false
positives by over 90% [4] compared to popular alternatives:

 	* With Semgrep, there's no need to manually filter and prioritize
findings because developers only see exploitable, high-priority
issues.
 	* Instead of asking devs to trust a black box, Semgrep offers
explainable findings with rule-level visibility.
 	* Semgrep then delivers AI-assisted, step-by-step fix guidance to
reduce issue resolution time. 

👉 THE BOTTOM LINE? Developers spend 86% less time reviewing
findings [4] and sifting through alert noise. That's 15+ hours saved
every week.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SONICWALL: 100% OF FIREWALL BACKUPS WERE BREACHED (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 SonicWall has revealed that every firewall configuration backup
stored in its cloud service was breached, a leap from the earlier
estimate of just 5%. The files contain encrypted credentials, which
increase the risk of targeted attacks, although no such incidents have
been reported so far. The company is urging all affected customers to
reset credentials and follow guidance. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT AUTH BYPASS IN SERVICE FINDER WORDPRESS THEME (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WordPress security firm, Wordfence, is warning users of the Service
Finder premium WordPress theme of a critical (CVSS 9.8/10)
vulnerability. The vulnerability is an authentication bypass
vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass authentication and log
in as administrators. Although a patch was released in July, Wordfence
is reporting a sharp uptick in exploitation starting in September. 

 GITHUB COPILOT CHAT FLAW LEAKED DATA FROM PRIVATE REPOSITORIES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A vulnerability in GitHub Copilot Chat allowed attackers to combine
Content Security Policy bypass with remote prompt injection to leak
sensitive data from private repositories, including AWS keys and
zero-day vulnerabilities. The attack exploited hidden HTML comments
and GitHub's Camo proxy system by creating a dictionary of
pre-generated Camo URLs for each alphabet character, allowing data to
be exfiltrated when victims clicked on malicious URLs. GitHub
addressed the issue on August 14 by preventing Camo from being used to
leak sensitive user information.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CYBERCRIME OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FRONTLINES: UNC6040 PROACTIVE
HARDENING RECOMMENDATIONS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UNC6040 is a financially motivated threat group that uses voice
phishing (vishing) to trick employees into authorizing malicious
Salesforce Data Loader applications, enabling large-scale data theft
from corporate Salesforce instances. The attackers impersonate IT
support personnel to manipulate victims into granting OAuth access to
fake connected apps, then systematically exfiltrate sensitive data
using legitimate Salesforce tools. Organizations should implement
phishing-resistant MFA, restrict API access to approved applications
only, enforce network-based login restrictions, and deploy real-time
detection rules that monitor for suspicious OAuth authorizations
followed by bulk data exports. 

 ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE ZERO-DAY EXPLOITED IN WIDESPREAD EXTORTION
CAMPAIGN (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A threat actor linked to the CL0P group exploited a previously
unknown vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite, stealing sensitive
data from targeted organizations and launching a mass extortion email
campaign. Attackers leverage sophisticated multi-stage Java payloads
and compromised third-party accounts. Although Oracle issued critical
emergency patches to mitigate the risk, this is still being actively
exploited. 

 IMPLEMENTING USAGE AND SECURITY REPORTING FOR AMAZON ECR (5 MINUTE

 Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) provides both repository and
image-level usage and security scan information. This walkthrough
provides sample code for generating centralized reports to aggregate
this data across both images and repositories. The walkthrough also
includes information for setting up Athena tables and queries to
analyze the data.

 MICROSOFT: WINDOWS BACKUP NOW AVAILABLE FOR ENTERPRISE USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Microsoft's Windows Backup for Organizations is an enterprise-grade
backup tool that backs up Windows settings, preferences, and Microsoft
Store apps to Exchange Online cloud storage, simplifying Windows 10 to
Windows 11 migrations. The feature is opt-in and disabled by default,
requiring IT administrator configuration through backup and restore
policy settings on Entra-joined devices. Microsoft encrypts the
backed-up data but retains access for troubleshooting and legal
compliance purposes under strict management oversight. 

 BROKEN AUTHORIZATION IN APIS: INTRODUCING AUTOSWAGGER (7 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Intruder's Autoswagger is a free open-source tool that automatically
scans APIs for authorization vulnerabilities by parsing
OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to identify endpoints lacking proper
authentication checks. The tool discovered critical security flaws
across major organizations during bug bounty testing, including
exposed credentials, customer data, and database access at companies
like Microsoft, multinational tech firms, and beverage corporations.
Autoswagger highlights how self-documenting APIs increase attack
surface by providing attackers with detailed endpoint information,
making these simple authorization weaknesses easier to exploit at
scale.

data sharing. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires
websites to allow Californians to opt out of data sharing, but it also
mandates that browsers universally support this. Previously, this had
to be done using third-party extensions.
