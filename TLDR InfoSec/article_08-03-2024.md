ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VMWARE SANDBOX ESCAPE BUGS ARE SO CRITICAL, PATCHES HAVE BEEN
RELEASED FOR END-OF-LIFE PRODUCTS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 VMware is urging customers to patch critical vulnerabilities that
allow hackers to escape VMware's sandbox and hypervisor protections
across all versions of ESXi, Workstation, Fusion, and Cloud Foundation
products. The four flaws, with two rated at a 9.3/10 severity,
undermine the products' core purpose of running sensitive operations
inside a virtual machine segmented from the host machine. 

 APPLE FIXES TWO NEW IOS ZERO-DAYS EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS ON IPHONES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has released fixes for two new iOS and iPadOS vulnerabilities.
The first vulnerability is in the iOS Kernel and the second is in
RTKit. Both vulnerabilities allow attackers with arbitrary kernel read
and write permissions to bypass kernel memory permissions. 

 WOGRAT MALWARE ABUSES ONLINE NOTEPAD SERVICES TO STORE MALWARE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new malware strain that targets both Windows and Linux is being
distributed as a base64 encoded payload from the aNotepad service. The
WogRAT malware on Windows is loaded as a DLL and communicates with C2
servers via POST requests to receive commands for uploading and
downloading files, waiting, running arbitrary commands, and
terminating. The Linux version behaves similarly except that it uses a
TinySHell backdoor to communicate with the C2 server over a reverse
shell.

 HOW TO HUNT FOR UEFI MALWARE USING VELOCIRAPTOR (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 UEFI attacks, which require advanced techniques, are becoming more
prevalent. This article begins with an overview of the UEFI system and
common attacks on UEFI malware. It then works through Rapid7‚Äôs
Velociraptor tool‚Äôs capabilities for performing forensic

 MEET SILVER SAML: GOLDEN SAML IN THE CLOUD (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Golden SAML is a post-exploitation attack technique that involves
extracting signing certificates from Active Directory Federation
Services to forge signing certificates. In the wake of the Solar Winds
attack, organizations were urged to move to a cloud-based SAML like
Entra ID to prevent Golden SAML attacks. This post presents a new
attack method that leverages externally generated SAML certificates to
forge authentication responses from an Entra ID SAML server.

 CAN ‚ÄòBUILD FAST‚Äô AND ‚ÄòBUILD SECURE‚Äô LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER?
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Tight deadlines for developers lead to security vulnerabilities, but
good luck convincing executives to move slower. A more realistic
solution? Faster security testing with Dynamic Analysis (DAST) [10].
Launch scans with a few clicks to rapidly find runtime vulnerabilities
[10] in web apps and APIs, and see near-instant results with <5% FPR.
