 THIS SAAS PLATFORM FULLY REPLICATES MANUAL NETWORK PENETRATION
TESTING ‚Äî AND COSTS 50% LESS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Does your network have vulnerabilities hackers can exploit? If you're
not network pentesting, you're not going to know.

vPenTest [4] makes network pentesting easy for IT teams. It's a SaaS
platform [4] that combines the expertise, methods, and tools of
traditional testing, without the hefty price tag and time commitment.

üîç¬†Fully replicates manual network pentesting [4]: identifies
sensitive data, performs exploits, simulates attacks, cracks
passwords, escalates privileges, and more.

‚è∞ Test monthly, not yearly to avoid risky gaps between your security
assessments.

üìä Helps meet your PCI, HIPAA, and cyber liability compliance
requirements.

üí∞ Costs 50% less [4] than manual tests

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 JULY 2: POLYFILL.IO SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK ‚Äì DIGGING INTO THE WEB OF
COMPROMISED DOMAINS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post dives into a supply chain attack on the JavaScript library
Polyfill.io that affected over 384,000 hosts, including major
websites. While the immediate threat has been mitigated, experts
advise removing all references to Polyfill.io. 

 CATCHING COMPROMISED COOKIES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post details how Slack detects compromised session cookies to
prevent session hijacking. Slack Initially attempted to build its
system by looking at the last accessed timestamp of a particular
cookie to determine session forking but quickly determined that this
led to a lot of false positives and added more information such as the
IP address. The post also examines how performance concerns were
mitigated and the rollout procedure. 

 EXPLOITING CLIENT-SIDE PATH TRAVERSAL TO PERFORM CROSS-SITE REQUEST
FORGERY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A group of researchers have discovered a method that utilizes
Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) to achieve Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF). CSPT vulnerabilities have historically been viewed as
low severity due to limited impact. This research shows that an
attacker could utilize a CSPT vulnerability to chain a CSRF
vulnerability and execute actions on behalf of an end user to a web
application. The post includes examples of how CSPTs can be utilized
to cause CSRF such as by using an open redirect to leak sensitive data
associated with the source.
