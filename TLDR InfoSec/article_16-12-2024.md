ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 YEARLONG SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK TARGETING SECURITY PROS STEALS 390K
CREDENTIALS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A sophisticated supply-chain attack has been targeting security and
technical personnel for a year using Trojanized open-source software
from GitHub and NPM to steal login credentials. The campaign employs
infected packages and spear phishing techniques to infiltrate
researchers' devices with a stealthy backdoor. 

 RHODE ISLAND'S ONLINE BENEFITS SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN AFTER CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Rhode Island's RIBridges public assistance system was taken offline
after a cyberattack potentially exposing personal data of hundreds of
thousands of people. The state plans to provide call center support,
credit monitoring, and alternative application methods while
investigating the breach. 

 390,000+ WORDPRESS CREDENTIALS STOLEN VIA MALICIOUS GITHUB REPOSITORY
HOSTING POC EXPLOITS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A GitHub repository hosting a WordPress tool was used to steal over
390,000 credentials by a threat actor named MUT-1244. The attacker
targeted security researchers and pentesters, exfiltrating sensitive
data like SSH keys and AWS access keys. The malicious campaign
involved phishing, trojanized GitHub repositories, and a
cryptocurrency miner payload.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LINUX LKM PERSISTENCE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post discusses different methods to establish persistence with a
Linux loadable kernel module type rootkit. Two simple methods that are
briefly touched upon are to use a user space persistence mechanism
that runs with root privileges to load the module or add the module to
/etc/modules. Instead, this author explores using a
systemd-modules-load file with the Diamorphine LKM rootkit which will
hide any file that contains a given magic string from the kernel to
hide the configuration file. The author then describes how timestamps
or checking for a tainted kernel can be used to detect this attack. 

 SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK ANALYSIS: ULTRALYTICS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Ultralytics Python project was recently targeted in a
supply-chain attack through compromised GitHub Actions workflows and
PyPI API tokens. PyPI experts were able to analyze the attack and
emphasize the importance of securing software forges and building
workflows for open source projects. To improve PyPI security,
developers are advised to use trusted publishers, audit workflows for
security vulnerabilities, and follow best practices like using 2FA and
rotating secrets. 

 DETECTING WIFI DUMPING VIA DIRECT WINAPI CALLS AND INTRODUCTION TO
IMMUTABLE ARTIFACTS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many detection rules rely on artifacts that are mutable by the
attacker. This author sought to investigate detections that relied on
immutable artifacts with the example of an attacker that enumerated
WiFi networks and dumped passwords directly via the WinAPI as opposed
to using tools such as netsh. The author initially ran into issues as
the program they wrote to enumerate networks did not cause any obvious
registry calls, spawn netsh, or read the Wlansvc\Profiles\Interfaces
file. The only method that the author found to detect the attack was
by enabling the noisy Sysmon Event ID 7 where a rule can be created by
searching for an event where the ImageLoaded is wlanapi.dll and the
Image contains an unfamiliar .exe.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 📘 DATADOG RESEARCH REVEALS TOP CLOUD SECURITY RISKS: LONG-LIVED
CREDENTIALS, INSECURE IAM ROLES, AND MORE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Datadog analyzed security posture data from thousands of
organizations on AWS /Azure / GCP. The findings [11] suggest ongoing
challenges with long-lived credentials and risks related to Kubernetes
distributions, alongside adoption of proactive cloud security
mechanisms such as S3 Public Access Block or IMDSv2 in AWS. Read the
State of Cloud Security 2024 report [11] 

 SILENT PUSH (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Silent Push proactively detects potential cyber threats using an
automated global intelligence system to monitor and predict attack
patterns, helping organizations defend against various digital threats
through advanced monitoring and data enrichment techniques. 

 VANIR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Vanir is a source code-based static analysis tool that automatically
identifies the list of missing security patches in the target system.
By default, Vanir pulls up-to-date CVEs from Open Source
Vulnerabilities (OSV) together with their corresponding signatures so
that users can transparently scan missing patches for an up-to-date
list of CVEs. 

 JWT-CLI (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A CLI tool to encode and decode JWTs, written in Rust. It works as a
pipe command and can be helpful to decode access tokens from other
commands like curl.

 UNITEDHEALTH'S OPTUM LEFT AN AI CHATBOT, USED BY EMPLOYEES TO ASK
QUESTIONS ABOUT CLAIMS, EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Optum restricted access to an internal AI chatbot after it was found
publicly accessible online. The chatbot, designed to help employees
handle insurance claims, did not contain sensitive data but raised
concerns about AI's role in claims processing. 

 GERMANY SINKHOLES BOTNET OF 30,000 BADBOX-INFECTED DEVICES (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Germany's cybersecurity agency reported that 30,000 media devices
were infected with BadBox malware before sale. The agency has
sinkholed communication with command servers, advised internet
providers, and recommended users disconnect and scan potentially
compromised devices from pre-infected Android equipment. 

 CONFIDENTIAL COMPUTING AT 1PASSWORD (6 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 To ensure the security of its customers' secrets, 1Password utilizes
end-to-end encryption to ensure that the data is not accessible by
anyone, even at 1Password. To achieve this goal, 1Password utilizes
AWS Nitro Enclaves to create a cryptographically verifiably, isolated
confidential compute environment. 1Password publishes each enclave
release to a public transparency log and then verifies the attestation
when the client opens an encrypted channel. This ensures that no
1Password or AWS employees can access the code or communications
running in the enclaves.
