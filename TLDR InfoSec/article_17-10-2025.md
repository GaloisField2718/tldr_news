TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-10-17

 STAY SECURE DURING M&AS WITH 1PASSWORD (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Mergers and acquisitions are complex enough without managing a data
breach. Unfortunately, more than 1 in 3 CISOs have reported
experiencing a breach tied to M&A activity.

Get ahead of the risks and arm your team with tools to:

	* Discover inherited shadow IT and AI
	* Automate employee onboarding and offboarding
	* Eliminate weak and unmanaged credentials
	* Find unused and unnecessary SaaS licenses

With 1Password Extended Access Management, teams can keep M&As secure
from Day 1 of integration.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FAKE LASTPASS, BITWARDEN BREACH ALERTS LEAD TO PC HIJACKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Cybercriminals are conducting a phishing campaign targeting password
manager users with fake breach notification emails that trick
recipients into downloading malware disguised as "secure desktop
versions" of LastPass and Bitwarden. The malicious downloads install
Syncro MSP agent software configured to deploy ScreenConnect remote
access tools, giving attackers full control over compromised systems
while remaining hidden from users. Security professionals should
educate users that legitimate password manager companies never request
master passwords via email and that security incidents are always
announced through official channels and verified company blogs. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT CISCO SNMP FLAW TO DEPLOY ROOTKIT ON SWITCHES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers at Trend Micro uncovered a malware campaign that exploits
a recently patched remote code execution vulnerability in older Cisco
IOS and IOS XE devices to install a Linux rootkit. This flaw leverages
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and permits attackers
with root privileges to execute arbitrary code, bypassing security
controls such as Cisco's Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
(AAA) framework and Virtual Teletype (VTY) access control lists. Once
active, the rootkit conceals running configurations, manipulates logs,
and resets timestamps to evade detection, thereby gaining persistent
control over affected devices. 

 SENSITIVE CUSTOMER INFO EXPOSED IN MANGO DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Spanish fashion retailer Mango reported a data breach after one of
its third-party service providers experienced unauthorized access. The
breached data includes first names, countries, postal codes, email
addresses, and phone numbers. Mango stressed that financial
information, IDs, usernames, and passwords were not leaked.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CVE-2025-49844 - THE REDIS CVSS 10.0 VULNERABILITY AND HOW WE
RESPONDED (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Report URI's response to the critical Redis vulnerability
demonstrates a layered defense strategy: they immediately implemented
ACL restrictions to disable EVAL and EVALSHA commands as a temporary
mitigation, then leveraged their recently deployed Redis Sentinel
high-availability setup to perform zero-downtime upgrades to the
patched version. Their existing security posture, which included
network isolation, strict firewall rules, role-based access controls,
and comprehensive logging, meant they were already protected from
exploitation and could quickly verify that no compromise had occurred
through command statistics analysis. Security teams should prioritize
defense-in-depth architecture that enables rapid response to critical
vulnerabilities, including network segmentation, quickly modifiable
access controls, and high-availability configurations that allow for
seamless patching without service disruption. 

 STARTUP SECURITY: RATIOS AND A 24-MONTH HIRING PLAN (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The author recommends a 1:40 security-to-employee ratio and 1:100
IT-to-employee ratio for startups, based on research from successful
companies like GitHub and GitLab. He advocates for organizing security
teams into four distinct areas: IT (employee enablement), Security
Operations (infrastructure and compliance), GRC (governance and
customer-facing security), and Product Security (application security
and engineering). The document includes a detailed 24-month hiring
plan that scales from 5 security staff at 187 employees to 16 security
staff at 600 employees, emphasizing that proper staffing ratios are
essential for moving from reactive to proactive security postures. 

 AUTOMATION OF VHDX INVESTIGATIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX) files are commonly generated by Virtual
Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments and can be very useful to
forensic investigators. Velociraptor is frequently used in
investigations but fails to discover or parse the NTUSER.DAT hives in
VHDX files without injecting a synthetic ProfileList registry hive or
customizing the Windows.Sys.Users artifact to support VHDX discovery
logic. To perform this analysis at scale, a single remapping
configuration can be used, multiple virtual Velociraptor clients can
be launched, or a batch processing approach can be used as a middle
ground.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 THE HIDDEN THREAT IN EVERY SLACK CHANNEL (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Slack conversations are discoverable—and exploitable. By treating
eDiscovery like risk management, one savvy media company avoided a
million-dollar surprise legal bill and strengthened its data security
position. Onna makes legal and infosec work together to contain
exposure.

 MCPTOTAL LAUNCHES TO POWER SECURE ENTERPRISE MCP WORKFLOWS (2 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 MCPTotal launched as the first comprehensive security platform for
Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations, addressing critical
vulnerabilities in enterprise AI integrations, including supply chain
exposures, prompt injection attacks, rogue MCP servers, and data
exfiltration risks that traditional security tools cannot monitor. The
platform provides a hub-and-gateway architecture with centralized
hosting, authentication, credential vaulting, and AI-native firewall
capabilities. It monitors MCP traffic and enforces real-time policies
while offering a vetted catalog of secure MCP servers. Security
professionals should recognize that MCP adoption creates a new attack
surface requiring specialized monitoring and governance, and should
evaluate solutions that provide visibility into AI-to-enterprise
system connections, implement proper authentication controls, and
establish policies for employee MCP usage to prevent shadow IT risks. 

 SECUREVIBES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SecureVibes is an AI-native security system for vibecoded
applications that uses Claude's multi-agent architecture to find
security vulnerabilities in your code base autonomously. 

 MONDOO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Mondoo provides an agentic vulnerability management platform enabling
organizations to categorize, prioritize, and remediate risks across
on-prem, cloud, SaaS, and endpoints.

 SOC 2 IS DEAD, LONG LIVE SOC 2! (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The author argues that SOC 2 and other security compliance frameworks
have fundamental flaws: vague control requirements disconnected from
specific threats, audit methodologies that only assess current state
rather than historical effectiveness, and static reports that quickly
become outdated in dynamic environments. He proposes ALCOVE (Assurance
Levels for Control Operating Viability & Effectiveness), a new
framework inspired by software supply chain security models that would
provide continuous monitoring, threat-informed requirements, and
real-time dashboards showing historical control effectiveness. The
proposal includes integrating cyber insurance incentives to drive
adoption, where insurers would receive continuous control data from
vendors in exchange for premium discounts, creating better-aligned
incentives across all stakeholders. 

 APPLE TAKES DOWN NEW ICE APP THAT ARCHIVES AGENTS ARREST VIDEOS
FOLLOWING ICEBLOCK REMOVAL (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Apple has removed another anti-ICE app on the App Store. The “Eyes
Up” app shared location data of arrests that have already happened
and holds archives of arrest videos. 

 NATION-STATE HACKERS DELIVER MALWARE FROM “BULLETPROOF”
BLOCKCHAINS (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hackers, including those working for North Korea, are distributing
malware using Ethereum and BNB blockchains, making it immune to
takedowns and almost impossible to trace. By embedding malicious code
in blockchain smart contracts, attackers can bypass traditional
security measures, easily update payloads, and use job scams to lure
developers into running these contracts as part of the interview
process.
