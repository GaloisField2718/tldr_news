 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT AI AGENTS WILL LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR. HOW SHOULD YOU
APPROACH SECURITY TODAY? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 “Thought leaders” are confident about non-human identities, but
can they predict what this landscape will look like in 12 months? Not
reliably...

🤨 So how should you defend against a risk that's totally
unpredictable? Start with these RESOURCES FROM OKTA:

>> Watch [5] experts from AWS, Okta, and Guidewire share their
perspective on this new frontier.

>> Learn [4]how to manage NHIs and see real-time detection of multiple
NHI risk types, mapped to the relevant OWASP Top 10.

>> Try an interactive demo [6] to see how Okta Identity Security
Posture Management (ISPM) unifies human and non-human identity
management across your environment.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CHINESE STATE HACKERS JAILBROKE CLAUDE AI CODE FOR AUTOMATED BREACHES
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chinese state-sponsored actors jailbroke Anthropic's Claude Code tool
by disguising malicious tasks as legitimate defensive security work,
achieving the first documented fully autonomous AI-driven cyber
operation where the AI handled 80-90% of tactical work. The campaign
targeted approximately 30 organizations globally across tech, finance,
chemical manufacturing, and government sectors, achieving successful
intrusions in roughly four cases before Anthropic banned the accounts.
Security teams must now deploy AI-powered defensive capabilities to
detect threats more quickly and counter the new paradigm of automated
offensive operations. 

 DOORDASH HIT BY NEW DATA BREACH IN OCTOBER EXPOSING USER INFORMATION
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 DoorDash disclosed a data breach orchestrated by an unauthorized
third party that accessed internal data through the social engineering
of an employee. The breached data includes first and last names,
physical and email addresses, and phone numbers. Some victims have
expressed outrage over the wording of the notice and the delay in
notification. 

 LOGITECH CONFIRMS DATA BREACH AFTER CLOP EXTORTION ATTACK (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Logitech confirmed that it suffered a data breach due to a zero-day
flaw after the Clop ransomware group added it to its list of victims.
The company stated that the data may include limited information on
employees, consumers, customers, and suppliers, but the databases did
not contain financial information or IDs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN THE IMPERSONATION FUNCTION GETS USED TO IMPERSONATE USERS
(FORTINET FORTIWEB AUTH. BYPASS CVE-2025-64446) (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Fortinet FortiWeb appliances are being actively exploited via
CVE-2025-64446, a pre-auth RCE chain combining path traversal and
authentication bypass that allows attackers to reach privileged CGI
functions and impersonate users by crafting a base64-encoded CGIINFO
header containing admin credentials. The vulnerability was silently
patched in version 8.0.2 and affects multiple FortiWeb versions. It
enables complete appliance compromise through administrative account
creation. WatchTowr released a detection tool on GitHub to identify
vulnerable hosts. 

 WTF IS… - AI-NATIVE SAST (17 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Leveraging AI as a complement to a traditional SAST can significantly
improve results by using RAG to inject context on specific
vulnerability classes. AI and SAST solutions can be leveraged using
prompt-and-code, prompt-and-agent, or tailored-prompt-and-SAST-result
methods. This post examines ZeroPath as an example of an agent, code
graph, and SAST MCP. 

 MAKING SERIALIZATION GADGETS BY HAND - .NET (1 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Creating deserialization gadgets for .NET by hand requires
understanding the structure of .NET serialization streams, which are
composed of sequential records that define objects and references. By
breaking down these records, including headers, class information,
member types, and values, it becomes possible to craft custom gadget
chains directly in code, without relying on pre-generated payloads or
Windows-only tools. The approach presented demonstrates how to
reconstruct objects, assign values, and embed complex references,
providing insight into the safe and dynamic generation of
deserialization payloads.

 VALID LOGIN != VERIFIED IDENTITY (SPONSOR) [13] 

 Today's attackers aren't breaking in. They're logging in.  This
Persona eBook [13] explains how today's evolving threat landscape is
changing the game for enterprise security teams — and how identity
verification is the new layer of defense against GenAI-powered fraud.

 NOMORESTEALER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 NoMoreStealer is a Windows kernel minifilter driver that intercepts
file system operations and blocks untrusted processes from accessing
specific protected paths. 

 SPYDITHREATINTEL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Spydi's ThreatIntel Feed is a comprehensive threat intelligence
platform that aggregates, curates, and maintains high-quality
blocklists for malicious IPs and domains. The system combines data
from multiple OSINT sources, honeypot networks, and threat
intelligence feeds to provide actionable security data. 

 DAYLIGHT (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 Daylight is an AI-powered Managed Detection and Response (MDR)
platform that offers autonomous cyber threat hunting, analysis, and
containment.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BE CAREFUL RESPONDING TO UNEXPECTED JOB INTERVIEWS (4 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Attackers are impersonating legitimate recruiters via LinkedIn and
email, luring victims with fake job interviews that redirect to
malicious sites hosting RMM tools disguised as meeting software
updates. The phishing campaign uses social engineering tactics,
including spoofed recruiter names from real companies, Gmail sender
addresses instead of corporate domains, and shortened URL redirects to
phishing infrastructure. Security teams should alert users to verify
unsolicited recruitment contacts independently, scrutinize sender
domains and meeting URLs, and block known malicious RMM tool
distributions through endpoint security controls. 

 BEHIND THE COMPLAINTS: OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUSPICIOUS PRESSURE
ON ARCHIVE.TODAY (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AdGuard DNS received threatening demands from “Web Abuse
Association Defense” (WAAD) to block Archive.today for allegedly
hosting CSAM, but investigation revealed WAAD was registered in
February 2025 with hidden ownership, minimal online presence, and
suspicious bailiff reports created chiefly in August 2025 despite
claims dating to 2023. Archive.today promptly removed flagged content
and stated it never received prior notifications, suggesting a
coordinated campaign of fraudulent complaints targeting the archival
service through French LCEN law. AdGuard is filing criminal complaints
with the French police for false reporting (punishable by up to 1 year
in prison and a €15,000 fine), noting the suspicious timing of the
FBI's investigation into Archive.today and potential impersonation of
a real lawyer in similar complaints. 

 GOOGLE TO FLAG ANDROID APPS WITH EXCESSIVE BATTERY USAGE ON THE
GOOGLE PLAY STORE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Google has announced that it will begin flagging apps on the Google
Play Store that pass a defined bad behavior threshold. The Android
vitals system will track partial wake locks, the cumulative time the
app spends with background work while the screen is off, and prevent
the device from entering sleep mode. Flagged apps will have a warning
on their Play Store page and be excluded from prominent discovery
surfaces such as recommendations.
