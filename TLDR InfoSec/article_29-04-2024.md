ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HEALTH INSURANCE GIANT KAISER WILL NOTIFY MILLIONS OF DATA BREACH (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kaiser is notifying 13.4 million current and former members and
patients of a data breach. After conducting an investigation, Kaiser
found that certain online technologies previously installed on its
websites and mobile apps may have transmitted personal information to
third-party advertisers. The data shared includes member names and IP
addresses, whether the members were signed into a Kaiser Permanente
account, how members navigated the website and mobile apps, and search
terms used in the health encyclopedia. 

 BOGUS POST OFFICE TEXTS DELIVER A SHOCKING AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC TO SCAM
WEBSITES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 According to research done by Akamai, fake USPS smishing attacks
delivered traffic to fake USPS sites that were on par, or even
exceeding, traffic to the legitimate USPS website. Akamai conducted a
fairly conservative analysis by deriving a malicious domain list from
one smishing text that an employee received. The attacks have been
successful, despite many public awareness campaigns to protect users
from them. 

 OVER 1,400 CRUSHFTP INSTANCES VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITED ZERO-DAY (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-4040) in CrushFTP, a
managed file transfer software, remains unpatched in over 1,400
instances. The flaw allows remote code execution by escaping the VFS
sandbox. CrushFTP is urging customers to update after disclosing
in-the-wild exploitation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 S3 BUCKET ENCRYPTION DOESN'T WORK THE WAY YOU THINK IT WORKS (4
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 S3 Bucket Encryption options all equate to access control more than
encryption. In nearly every S3 encryption option (default SSE, KMS,
and SSE-C), the user can either download the decrypted file if they
have permissions to the encryption material or cannot download the
file. Since a user never actually interacts with the encrypted file,
the encryption feels more like access control. 

 REMEDIATING AWS IMDSV1 (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article provides an overview of the benefits of IMDSv2 vs
IMDSv1. It covers detection methods to identify EC2 instances with
IMDSv1 enabled and CloudWatch queries to identify access to the
service. It also details how to disable the service and place
guardrails to prevent instances being launched with it enabled. 

 AUTOMATING API VULNERABILITY TESTING USING POSTMAN WORKFLOWS (4
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post discusses automating API vulnerability testing using
Postman Workflows, a feature that streamlines the process of
demonstrating API vulnerabilities without programming. By creating
sequences of HTTP requests within Postman, users can automate tasks
like identifying Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA)
vulnerabilities and retrieving sensitive data. Postman Workflows offer
a visual drag-and-drop approach to building automated flows for API
testing and exploitation.

 MICROSOFT NEEDS TO WIN BACK TRUST (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft is grappling with a series of high-profile security
incidents that have undermined trust in the tech giant. Hackers have
spied on Microsoft's senior leadership emails, exploited Microsoft
Exchange and Cloud services to access business and government email
accounts, and stolen source code despite efforts to improve defenses.
The company's security culture is inadequate and requires an overhaul.


 UK'S INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL TO BECOME LAW DESPITE TECH WORLD
OPPOSITION (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The UK's controversial Investigatory Powers (Amendment) Bill 2024,
dubbed the "snooper's charter", has received royal assent and will
expand the digital surveillance capabilities of intelligence agencies,
police, and others under the existing Investigatory Powers Act 2016.
The amendments allow authorities to gather more data from citizens,
including telecoms activity, to tackle "modern threats", including
national security and child abuse. Critics have raised privacy
concerns over the widened powers. 

 HOW WE BUILT THE NEW FIND MY DEVICE NETWORK WITH USER SECURITY AND
PRIVACY IN MIND (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This blog post from Google Security describes how the Find My feature
was built with privacy and end-to-end encryption while utilizing
crowdsourcing. Safety-first protections, such as aggregation by
default and at-home protection, help prevent unwanted tracking and
ensure user safety. Users also have full control over their device
participation in the network, providing options to contribute to
aggregated location reporting or opt-out completely.
