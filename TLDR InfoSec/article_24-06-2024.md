 THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO WORKFLOW AUTOMATION FOR SECURITY TEAMS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Workflow automation allows teams to automate and streamline processes
like phishing attack response, suspicious login alerts, EDR,
vulnerability management, and even employee onboarding. And with AI
[4], teams can work faster than ever before.

Tines has published the ultimate resource on workflow automation [4].
This handy resource covers the evolution of automation, best practices
for security professionals, and use cases from teams at Elastic and
Mars.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CDK GLOBAL BEGINS TO RESTORE SYSTEMS AFTER CYBER HACK HITS THOUSANDS
OF RETAILERS (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RESTRUCTURING THE BINARY NINJA DECOMPILER (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Binary Ninja uses a control graph resolution algorithm to undo
compiler optimizations by collapsing conditions to generate code that
is more akin to what a programmer would write. Conditional complexity
explosion leads to unwieldy conditional expressions in decompiled
code, which could lead to the Binary Ninja decompiler in version 4.0
and prior crashing, falling back to adding gotos, or generating
unsound or inaccurate code. Binary Ninja added a new set of algorithms
to transform the control graph structure to optimize control flow
recovery that achieved 100% accuracy in its test suite. 

 BYPASSING OKTA'S PASSWORDLESS MFA: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AND DETECTION
(7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Okta FastPass is a cryptographic MFA that facilitates passwordless
authentication by creating a device-bound Proof of Possession factor
upon device enrollment. OktaTerrify is a tool that can be used in
conjunction with OktaInk in a workflow described in the article to
bypass Okta FastPass and backdoor an Okta account on a compromised
host. The article also provides examples of detecting this workflow in
the Okta audit log. 

 HOW TO CREATE A PIPELINE FOR HARDENING AMAZON EKS NODES AND AUTOMATE
UPDATES (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 A blog post from AWS Security on creating a pipeline for hardening
EKS nodes. The pipeline uses EC2 Image Builder to apply the CIS
benchmarks for Amazon Linux to build a custom image, then uses a State
Machine to update the EKS nodes, and finally creates a Lambda function
to send a weekly reminder to update if a new base image is available.
A CloudFormation template is included in the post.

embedded QR codes in PDF attachments. NNX Store is suspected to be a
rebranded version of the Caffeine phishing kit that offers services
like 2FA bypass mechanisms and Cloudflare protection. The platform
facilitates the distribution of phishing tools and aids cybercriminals
in stealing credentials for financial gain and potential ransomware
attacks.
