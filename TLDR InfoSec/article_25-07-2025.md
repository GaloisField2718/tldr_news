ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SONICWALL URGES ADMINS TO PATCH CRITICAL RCE FLAW IN SMA 100 DEVICES
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SonicWall is urging customers to patch Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100
series appliances against a new critical authenticated arbitrary file
upload vulnerability. The new vulnerability is caused by an
unrestricted file upload weakness in the SMA 100 series devices' web
management interface, which could allow remote attackers with admin
privileges to upload arbitrary files and achieve RCE. 

 HACKER SNEAKS INFOSTEALER MALWARE INTO EARLY ACCESS STEAM GAME (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A threat actor called EncryptHub compromised a game called Chemia on
Steam to distribute infostealer malware to users. Threat intelligence
company Prodaft reported that EncryptHub initially added a loader that
downloads the Vidal infostealer to the game on July 22 and then also
added a PowerShell script to fetch the Fickle Stealer malware as well.
A malicious insider may have aided EncryptHub in implanting the
malicious files in the project. 

 SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK COMPROMISES NPM PACKAGES TO SPREAD BACKDOOR
MALWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Attackers launched a "Scavenger" supply chain attack in July that
hijacked popular npm packages, including "is" (2.8 million weekly
downloads), through phishing from a typosquatted domain (npnjs.org).
The malware installed cross-platform JavaScript backdoors with
persistent command channels on Windows, macOS, and Linux, affecting
users who updated to infected versions. Exploiting high-privilege
maintainer accounts, attackers could compromise thousands of
companies, with malware mostly undetected by antivirus solutions on
VirusTotal.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FUTURE OF THREAT EMULATION: BUILDING AI AGENTS THAT HUNT LIKE
CLOUD ADVERSARIES (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Agentic AI unlocks a powerful utility for emulating the methodology
of advanced cloud pentesters or threat actors in a context-aware
method that goes beyond traditional automated tooling. This post
demonstrates how an agent can be provided with “tools” or
functions that it can utilize first to enumerate the permissions a
given IAM user has, iteratively identify privilege escalation
exploits, and then use other tools to carry out the privilege
escalation. The post also includes a scenario in which the agent
successfully discovers the full attack chain that an adversary could
use to launch an S3 ransomware attack. 

 INCENTIVES FOR SECURITY: FLIPPING THE SCRIPT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional security incentives often fail because they lack tangible
business value. Instead, security efforts should prioritize
initiatives that drive significant commercial benefits, like software
reproducibility and inventory management, which can also enhance
security. Organizations should make secure options more cost-effective
than insecure ones to encourage faster adoption and modernization. 

 HOW ANTHROPIC TEAMS USE CLAUDE CODE (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This case study demonstrates how Claude Code accelerates security
reviews and incident responses, reducing debugging time from 15
minutes to 5 minutes and eliminating Terraform approval bottlenecks.
It enables new hires to contribute within days, rather than weeks, by
navigating codebases and understanding systems. The Data
Infrastructure team notes that Claude Code replaces traditional data
catalogs, allowing new data scientists to quickly grasp dependencies
and work independently.

 AMAZON Q: NOW WITH HELPFUL AI-POWERED SELF-DESTRUCT CAPABILITIES (4
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 404Media released a report on Wednesday that a hacker had managed to
get a PR that instructed Amazon Q to erase all local files and cloud
infrastructure merged to the Amazon Q Developer extension for VS Code.
Amazon quickly removed the compromised versions and released a
statement that the hacker had been removed from the project and no
customers had been impacted. Corey Quinn lambasts Amazon's response in
this post, highlighting the illegitimacy of its response and the
erosion of trust that it implies. 

 PHISHERS TARGET AVIATION EXECS TO SCAM CUSTOMERS (6 MINUTE READ) [15]


 A Nigerian cybercrime group, known as "SilverTerrier," targets
aviation and transportation executives by phishing emails to hijack
emails and create lookalike domains for fake invoices, resulting in at
least one victim losing six figures. Researchers have linked hundreds
of phishing domains to the group since 2012, based on registration
patterns, which contributed to part of the $2.8 billion in BEC losses
reported last year. Companies have a 66% chance of recovering funds if
they report to ic3.gov within 72 hours via the Financial Fraud Kill
Chain, but most victims are unaware of this. 

 ILLUSORY WISHES: CHINA-NEXUS APT TARGETS THE TIBETAN COMMUNITY (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A China-linked Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group launched
"Operation GhostChat," targeting the Tibetan community by compromising
legitimate websites and replacing them with malicious replicas that
offer a backdoored version of the Element encrypted messaging app. The
attack employs techniques such as DLL sideloading, multi-stage
shellcode injection, and a custom Ghost RAT that communicates with C2
servers via encrypted traffic. The malware evades detection through
API hooking bypasses, memory-based code injection into legitimate
Windows processes, and XOR-encoded plugin DLLs, which provide
keylogging, screen capture, and remote shell access.
