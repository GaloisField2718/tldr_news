TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-08-07

 LEVEL-UP YOUR SECURITY WITH CONFIDENCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 As you scale your business, security needs to be more than a
checkbox—it should be the foundation for customer trust and
long-term growth. Vanta's Trust Maturity Report [4] helps you
benchmark your security program against your peers so you can level up
your security with confidence.

ALIGNED TO THE NIST CSF MATURITY TIERS, this report uses customer
insights and aggregated, anonymized data from Vanta's 12,000+
customers. Vanta helps growing companies achieve compliance quickly
and painlessly by automating 35+ frameworks—including SOC 2, ISO
27001, HIPAA, CMMC, and more.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CLINICAL DATA STOLEN IN CYBER-ATTACK ON KIDNEY DIALYSIS PROVIDER
DAVITA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 US-based kidney dialysis provider DaVita confirmed that sensitive PII
and clinical data were stolen from its systems, impacting over 900K
customers. In an attack that began on March 24 and continued until
April 12, the attackers stole names, dates of birth, SSNs,
health-insurance information, health conditions and other treatment
details, specific dialysis lab test results, tax identification
numbers, and images of checks written to DaVita. 

 COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY 2025 DATA BREACH EXPOSES STUDENT FINANCIAL
RECORDS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A report from Bloomberg details the data that was stolen from
Columbia University in a politically motivated data breach that
occurred in June. The attackers stole banking details, GPA records,
student loan disbursement records, scholarship information,
health-related financials tied to university insurance plans, and
other PII from current students and alumni dating back several years. 

 REVAULT! WHEN YOUR SOC TURNS AGAINST YOU (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cisco Talos reported 5 vulnerabilities to Broadcom and Dell affecting
the ControlVault3 firmware and its associated Windows APIs. Dell
ControlVault is a hardware-based Unified Security Hub (USH) that
connects various security peripherals, such as fingerprint readers,
smart card readers, and NFC readers, to function as a vault for
storing passwords, biometric templates, and security codes. These
vulnerabilities include a remote code execution vulnerability that
could allow non-administrative users to read data off the ControlVault
firmware or store an implant on it, as well as a vulnerability in
which a physical attacker could access the USH board without requiring
a login.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 (WHY) IAM DEMANDS AN #ATTACKGRAPH FIRST APPROACH (23 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Many organizations begin their security journey with tasks such as
mapping out a list of admins, enabling just-in-time access, and then
auditing how or why a user has admin access. Attackers begin their
process by obtaining lower privileges and then gradually escalating
those privileges until they have achieved admin privileges. To combat
this asynchronicity, security teams should instead develop attack
graphs to audit the access chains that can lead an attacker to gain
admin privileges. 

 C4 BOMB: BLOWING UP CHROME'S APPBOUND COOKIE ENCRYPTION (12 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 C4 (Chrome Cookie Cipher Cracker) is a technique that defeats
Google's AppBound Cookie Encryption, which was introduced in July 2024
to protect against infostealers. The attack exploits a padding oracle
vulnerability to decrypt cookies as a low-privileged user, ironically
turning Chrome's security feature into an attack vector for accessing
SYSTEM-level data on Windows machines. New security implementations
can inadvertently create novel attack surfaces when not properly
hardened against cryptographic vulnerabilities. 

 TRUST ME, I'M A LEGITIMATE PROCESS: VERISIMILITUDE AND THE ART OF
HIDING (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Modern adversaries focus on appearing believable rather than staying
hidden, using techniques like process impersonation, legitimate
parent-child relationships, and contextually appropriate command-line
arguments to blend into everyday operations. Deception can be
categorized into visual (fooling human analysts), logical (passing
reasoning checks), and behavioral (mimicking legitimate timing and
patterns) verisimilitude layers. Detection strategies must shift from
pure anomaly detection to plausibility-based approaches that question
whether actions make contextual sense for specific users, systems, and
operational environments.

 TRACKING CANDIRU'S DEVILSTONGUE SPYWARE IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES (9
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with the
Israeli-backed Candiru spyware. Candiru developed a spyware called
DevilsTongue, which is a Windows-based spyware with user and
kernel-mode components that maintains persistence via COM hijacking to
enable deep access to victim devices, enabling file extraction,
browser data collection, and theft of encrypted messages. Insikt Group
has identified five active clusters linked to infrastructure in
Hungary and Saudi Arabia. 

 MICROSOFT'S NEW AI REVERSE-ENGINEERS MALWARE AUTONOMOUSLY (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Microsoft Project Ire is an AI system designed to reverse-engineer
and identify malicious software autonomously. Project Ire
automatically dissects software files to understand how they work,
what they do, and whether they're dangerous without any clues as to
the software's origin or purpose. Microsoft's testing showed Project
Ire to have a 98% true positive rate on detecting malicious files.
