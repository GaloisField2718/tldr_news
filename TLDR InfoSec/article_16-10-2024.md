 ELIMINATING MEMORY SAFETY VULNERABILITIES AT THE SOURCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 This blog post explores how focusing on writing new code in memory
safe languages led to a decrease in vulnerabilities in an Android
project. It posits that the next stage in security is to focus on safe
coding and secure code practices. This is because vulnerabilities
decay exponentially so older code will become safer over time,
therefore teams should focus on writing new code in memory safe
languages and only work on the legacy code when bug fixing.
