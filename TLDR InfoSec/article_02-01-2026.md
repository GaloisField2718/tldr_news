ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TRUST WALLET CHROME EXTENSION HACK DRAINS $8.5M VIA SHAI-HULUD SUPPLY
CHAIN ATTACK (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Trust Wallet disclosed that the second iteration of the Shai-Hulud
supply chain attack in November compromised its Google Chrome
extension, resulting in the theft of approximately $8.5 million in
cryptocurrency assets. The attack leveraged malicious packages
published to npm and PyPI, compromising developer environments and
enabling attackers to insert malicious code into the extension for
wallet credential theft. 

 22 MILLION AFFECTED BY AFLAC DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers breached Aflac's US network in June 2025, stealing data on
about 22.65 million people, including names, addresses, Social
Security numbers, IDs, and medical and insurance details. Aflac
contained the attack without ransomware impact and is now offering 24
months of credit, identity, and medical fraud monitoring, urging
vigilance. 

 CONDÉ NAST HACK EXPOSES 40 MILLION USERS' DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacker calling themselves Lovely claims to have breached Condé
Nast's user database, leaking 2.3 million records with names and
contact details. They have threatened to dump 40 million more from
brands like Vogue and The New Yorker.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EQUIFAX EUROPE CISO: NOTORIOUS BREACH SPURRED CYBERSECURITY
TRANSFORMATION (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Equifax Continental Europe CISO Javier Checa detailed the company's
$3 billion transformation following the 2017 breach that compromised
147 million records, including a complete cloud migration, zero legacy
systems, and embedding security culture across all 300 cybersecurity
specialists, plus company-wide employee bonus structures tied to
security metrics. The company built its recovery strategy on
transparency and collaboration, publishing annual security reports
with incident-response metrics and sharing security control frameworks
publicly, while neutralizing 15 million daily threats (175 per second,
up 25% from 2023). Security teams should adopt hybrid defense
strategies combining AI-powered tools with traditional signature-based
protections, implement biometric authentication to counter deepfake
attacks, and ensure CISO representation on management committees to
maintain strategic alignment between security investments and business
objectives. 

 MAKING CLOUDFLARE WORKERS WORK FOR RED TEAMS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cloudflare Workers can provide a serverless, rapidly adaptable
platform for Conditional Access Payload Delivery (CAPD).
Authentication can be achieved via a custom header, and the system can
be enhanced by supplying secrets as environment variables, using more
generic error codes, or by using timing-safe comparisons. The post
also details detection opportunities for defenders. 

 SINGULARITY: DEEP DIVE INTO A MODERN STEALTH LINUX KERNEL ROOTKIT (67
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Singularity demonstrates advanced Linux rootkit tactics by leveraging
legitimate kernel features (ftrace) for syscall hooking and
implementing defense-in-depth across processes, filesystems, network
layers, and logging systems. The rootkit's dual-architecture support
(x86_64 and ia32) prevent a common detection bypass in which
investigators use 32-bit binaries to circumvent 64-bit-only hooks.
Comprehensive anti-forensics capabilities, including log sanitization,
taint flag manipulation, and module auto-hiding, render traditional
detection methods ineffective. Defenders should adopt memory-based
forensics techniques, monitor ftrace hook signatures in kernel debug
interfaces, test with both 32-bit and 64-bit tools, and recognize that
filesystem-based security checks can be completely intercepted by
kernel-level adversaries.

 HOW TO ACHIEVE YOUR CYBERSECURITY GOALS IN 2026 (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Those setting New Year's goals should start by establishing a system,
such as a study schedule, to achieve them. To-do lists or scheduled
blocks of time can help fight procrastination. Having a mentor or
friend keep you accountable can also help with ensuring goals are met.


 MONGODB UNAUTHENTICATED ATTACKER SENSITIVE MEMORY LEAK (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A critical flaw in MongoDB's use of the zlib compression library
allows network attackers to leak sensitive data from server memory
without requiring authentication. By sending specially crafted
compressed messages, they can gradually extract user information,
passwords, and API keys from affected MongoDB versions. Updating to
patched releases, closing unnecessary ports, and disabling zlib
compression where possible are key steps to reduce exposure. 

 COUPANG ANNOUNCES $1.18 BILLION COMPENSATION TO SOUTH KOREAN USERS
FOR DATA LEAK (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 South Korean Coupang will distribute 50,000 won vouchers to 33.7
million account holders after a data leak, totaling 1.69 trillion won
($1.18 billion). Critics say the vouchers, usable only on Coupang,
turn a privacy crisis into marketing and don't reflect the breach's
seriousness, sparking parliamentary hearings and consumer anger.
