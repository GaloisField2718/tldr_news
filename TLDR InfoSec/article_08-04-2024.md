 COMPROMISED CREDENTIALS WERE THE #1 ATTACK VECTOR IN 2024. WHAT CAN
YOU DO ABOUT IT? (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Credentials serve as the keys to our online existence ‚Äî and are
also a security liability.
The average professional manages up to 200 sets of credentials [3] on
average; when they‚Äôre compromised, cyber attackers gain instant
entry into sensitive systems and can often move laterally to find your
crown jewels.

There are ways to reduce the attack surface. In this upcoming webinar
[3], experts from Lacework will cover:

	* Execution methods behind compromised credential attacks
	* What bad actors do with stolen identities
	* Preventative best practices [3] to implement today

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HOYA‚ÄôS OPTICS PRODUCTION AND ORDERS DISRUPTED BY CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Japanese optical product manufacturer Hoya Corporation announced that
it is working to restore systems at some production plants following a
cyberattack. The incident prompted Hoya to isolate servers, impacting
IT systems at its headquarters and business divisions. The company has
engaged forensic investigators and notified relevant authorities as it
investigates and responds to the attack, which caused system failures
across its operations. 

 MISSOURI COUNTY DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AMID SUSPECTED RANSOMWARE
ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Jackson County, Missouri, has declared a state of emergency and
indefinitely closed key offices like Assessment, Collection, and
Recorder of Deeds in response to a suspected ransomware attack that
disrupted its IT systems. The attack has rendered certain systems
inoperable, impacting services like tax payments, marriage licenses,
and inmate searches, while other systems remain functional. 

 ANTHROPIC RESEARCHERS WEAR DOWN AI ETHICS WITH REPEATED QUESTIONS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers at Anthropic have devised a new technique to convince AI
models to answer questions that they aren‚Äôt meant to. The method
involves exploiting larger context windows to prime the LLM with a
series of questions (that it won‚Äôt answer due to filters) and
answers as if the LLM answered them. Over time, the LLM will get
‚Äúconfused‚Äù and think it answered the questions and will answer
inappropriate questions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM ONENOTE TO RANSOMNOTE: AN ICE COLD INTRUSION (8 MINUTE READ) [7]


 This article provides an overview of a campaign in which attackers
gained access via phishing users and escalated to a full ransomware
attack. The threat actor utilized OneNote links that loaded IcedID for
their initial access. The actor then stayed dormant while beaconing
for 30 days before utilizing Cobalt Strike and AnyDesk to move
laterally to a file server. Files were exfiltrated with FileZilla, and
then the Nokoyawa ransomware was deployed. The article includes IoCs
for each part of the attack. 

 BYPASSING ANTI-REVERSING DEFENSES IN IOS APPLICATIONS (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This blog post explains how to bypass anti-reversing defenses, such
as ptrace syscall and getppid() method, in iOS applications. It also
covers bypassing sysctl syscall and jailbreak detection to analyze and
manipulate application behavior at runtime. The author demonstrates
methods to overcome these security measures using tools like frida and
radare2. 

 APPLYING LLMS TO THREAT INTELLIGENCE (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article discusses the use of LLMs to enhance the capabilities of
threat intelligence analysts. It explains the technique of prompt
engineering and provides an example of an ideally crafted prompt. The
article also explores the practical applications of LLMs, few-shot
prompting, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

MINUTE READ) [13] 

 NIST has announced $3.6 million in grants to 18 education and
community organizations across 15 states to address the cybersecurity
skills shortage. Each state will receive around $200,000 to educate

 WIZ RESEARCH FINDS ARCHITECTURE RISKS THAT MAY COMPROMISE
AI-AS-A-SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CONSEQUENTLY RISK CUSTOMER DATA; WORKS
WITH HUGGING FACE ON MITIGATIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Critical risks in AI-as-a-service providers that could allow threat
actors to escalate privileges, gain cross-tenant access to other
customers' models, and more, have been identified. These risks stem
from the ability to run malicious models uploaded in pickle format on
shared inference infrastructure and exploit shared CI/CD systems. 

 WHY THE WORLD NEEDS A NEW CYBER TREATY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
(15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 With attacks on critical infrastructure in the energy and healthcare
sectors continuously increasing, it‚Äôs time for countries to adopt
binding international legislation that builds a new cyber treaty.
There have been some efforts made, but a coordinated response could
solidify previous efforts while building accountability and allowing
for resource allocation towards protecting critical infrastructure.
