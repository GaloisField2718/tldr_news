ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 A SINGLE CLICK MOUNTED A COVERT, MULTISTAGE ATTACK AGAINST COPILOT (4
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Varonis researchers discovered a now-patched vulnerability in
Microsoft Copilot Personal, dubbed "Reprompt," that enabled
single-click data exfiltration via indirect prompt injection in
legitimate Copilot URLs. The attack allowed the extraction of
usernames, locations, and chat history even after the victim closed
the chat window. Microsoft 365 Copilot was not affected. The
vulnerability has been remediated as of this week. 

 CIRO SAYS ABOUT 750K PEOPLE'S DATA AFFECTED BY CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT
(1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) says that the
data of about 750K Canadian investors was compromised in a breach last
year. The compromised data includes social insurance numbers,
investment account numbers, and phone numbers. CIRO stated that the
breach resulted from a sophisticated phishing attack. 

 SENSITIVE DATA OF EURAIL, INTERRAIL TRAVELERS COMPROMISED IN DATA
BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A breach at Eurail B.V., the company behind Eurail and Interrail
passes, exposed travellers' personal details, including contact
information and ID or passport data, and possibly bank and limited
health data for some DiscoverEU participants. Affected systems were
secured, passwords reset, and customers have been urged to watch for
phishing, change related passwords, and monitor bank accounts for
unusual activity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DISSECTING AND EXPLOITING CVE-2025-62507: REMOTE CODE EXECUTION IN
REDIS (16 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 JFrog's Security Researchers have demonstrated successful remote code
execution exploitation of CVE-2025-62507, a stack buffer overflow in
Redis 8.2.x's XACKDEL command with a CVSS score of 8.8.
Unauthenticated attackers can overwrite the return address using
crafted stream IDs, a vulnerability made easier by the lack of stack
canary protection in the official Docker image. Shodan detected
approximately 2,924 servers running vulnerable versions that are
immediately exploitable without authentication, while 183,907
additional instances with authentication could also be at risk.
Organizations are advised to upgrade to Redis 8.3.2, enable
authentication, and compile with the -fstack-protector option, as the
research highlights that CVSS scores alone should not determine
patching priorities, since high-severity vulnerabilities can still
offer straightforward remote code execution paths. 

 STREAMLINING SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS WITH AGENTS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Slack's security team introduced an agentic system for investigating
security issues that involves a Director persona instructing a series
of SME personas, with the results checked by a Critic persona. The
Director persona reviews the investigation's status and poses a
question to the experts, who use their domain expertise to prepare
answers. The Director then queries those answers to advance the
investigation loop or conclude the investigation. This system also
enables cost optimization: expert personas, which process more data,
can use cheaper models, whereas the Director persona, which requires
more reasoning, can use more expensive models. 

 THE ERA OF SEMANTIC SECURITY: COMPUTER USE AGENTS AND THE END OF
SIGNATURES (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Local computer use agents fundamentally shift the endpoint security
industry because a properly functioning agent can be indistinguishable
from a malicious agent or attacker, diminishing the value of
signatures. A previous analogue is the adoption of PowerShell by both
attackers and sysadmins, which made context necessary to distinguish
attacks from standard use. Successful organizations will need to build
contextual defense systems rather than trying to push back on agent
adoption.

 THE STATE OF RUST CRYPTOGRAPHY IN 2026 (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Rust's cryptography ecosystem has matured significantly, with
aws-lc-rs and ring now serving as the official crypto providers for
rustls. At least two libraries, aws-lc-rs and boring, offer FIPS 140-3
certification alongside post-quantum KEM support via Kyber algorithms.
The ecosystem divides between pure-Rust implementations, such as
RustCrypto, dalek-cryptography, and graviola, which offer better
auditability and cross-compilation, and C library wrappers that
provide assembly-optimized performance. This is a relevant trade-off
because 37.2 percent of cryptographic library vulnerabilities stem
from memory safety issues. For teams requiring FIPS compliance and
performance, aws-lc-rs is recommended. For WebAssembly targets and
easier cross-compilation, RustCrypto crates remain the preferred
choice. 

 ISVERIFIED (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 isVerified offers mobile apps that secure executive and institutional

 US GOV'T: HOUSE SYSADMIN STOLE 200 PHONES, CAUGHT BY HOUSE IT DESK (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A former House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
sysadmin was indicted for allegedly ordering 240 government cell
phones, shipping them to his home, and selling over 200 to a pawn shop
in a scheme that cost taxpayers $150,000. The scheme unraveled when
one phone, which was instructed to be sold only "in parts" to bypass
MDM controls, ended up intact on eBay. The buyer called the House IT
help desk number displayed on boot. The case highlights the importance
of asset management controls and segregation of duties for personnel
with procurement authority. 

 MICROSOFT TAPS UK COURTS TO DISMANTLE CYBERCRIME HOST REDVDS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Microsoft coordinated civil actions in the US and UK to take down
RedVDS, a cybercrime-as-a-service provider that rents cheap virtual
servers, fueling large-scale phishing and fraud campaigns worldwide
and causing at least $40 million in reported US losses. The operation
involves domain seizures, infrastructure disruption, and collaboration
with Europol, German authorities, and victim organizations like
H2-Pharma and a Florida condo association. 

 FRENCH DATA REGULATOR FINES TELCO SUBSIDIARIES $48 MILLION OVER DATA
BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 France's CNIL fined Free SAS and Free Mobile, subsidiaries of Groupe
Iliad, a combined €42 million after a 2024 breach exposed bank and
other personal data of 24 million subscribers. Regulators cited weak
VPN authentication, poor anomaly detection, and inadequate breach
notifications, and criticized the firms' basic security lapses. The
companies, which have since upgraded controls, plan to appeal, calling
the sanctions unprecedented and disproportionate.
