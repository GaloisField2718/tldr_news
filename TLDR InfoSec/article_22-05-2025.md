 SCATTERED SPIDER THREAT BRIEFING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Heard of LUCR-3 — AKA Scattered Spider, UNC3944, or Roasted
Oktapus? You should: this threat actor has recently infiltrated the
cloud environments of multiple Fortune 1000s.

Join a one-on-one threat briefing with Ian Ahl [4], SVP of P0 Labs and
former Head of Advanced Practices at Mandiant, to walk through many of
the group's TTPs, including several that are not widely known.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DDOSECRETS PUBLISHES 410 GB OF HEAP DUMPS, HACKED FROM TELEMESSAGE'S
ARCHIVE SERVER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Distributed Denial of Secrets published 410 GB of data that it stole
from TeleMessage, an Israeli firm that makes modified versions of chat
apps such as Signal and centrally archives messages. Some heap dumps
include plaintext metadata, while others only include metadata,
including sender and recipient information, timestamps, and group
names. Due to the sensitive nature and PII in the messages, DDoSecrets
only shared the data with journalists and researchers. 

 VANHELSING RANSOMWARE BUILDER LEAKED ON HACKING FORUM (3 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 After a former developer for the Ransomware-as-a-Service operator
VanHelsing attempted to sell the source code for the VanHelsing
affiliate panel, data leak Tor sites, and builders for the Windows and
Linux encryptors, VanHelsing proactively released the source code
itself. The leaked source code includes the Windows encryptor, which
will require modifications for other threat actors, and the source
code for the affiliate panel and blog site, which can be run as is.
The data VanHelsing leaked was only a subset of what the former
developer attempted to sell, as it did not include any databases or
the Linux builder. 

 COINBASE SAYS ITS DATA BREACH AFFECTS AT LEAST 69,000 CUSTOMERS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase reported that 69,461 customers had personal and financial
data stolen during a six-month breach. Hackers bribed support staff,
stealing names, addresses, ID documents, account balances, and
transaction histories. Despite a $20 million ransom demand, Coinbase
refused to pay.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY RECREATING AN IAM ROLE DOESN'T RESTORE TRUST: A GOTCHA IN ROLE
ARNS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 In AWS IAM, trust policies reference ARNs in their JSON but reference
an underlying, immutable principal ID, so if a role is deleted and
recreated, the trust policy will also need to be recreated, even if
the ARN is unchanged. This provides a security benefit in that if a
role is deleted but the trust policy is unintentionally not updated,
the role cannot be stealthily recreated and assume the same level of
trust. Users can get around this issue by using a complete account as
the principal in a trust policy with a condition block that restricts
access to the specific role ARN. 

 FORGET IPS: USING CRYPTOGRAPHY TO VERIFY BOT AND AGENT TRAFFIC (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In the era of AI agents, not all bot traffic is malicious. Cloudflare
proposed two mechanisms for “good bots” to self-identify. The
first is HTTP Message Signatures, which adds a Signature-Input header
with a signature, validity period, usage tag, and a Signature-Agent
header to locate the key. The second option is a new TLS flag,
req_mTLS, which allows clients to indicate support for mutual TLS and
identify the bot. 

 SECURING CI/CD WORKFLOWS WITH WAZUH (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CI/CD pipelines automate software development but introduce security
risks like supply chain attacks and misconfigurations. Wazuh, an
open-source security platform, enhances CI/CD security through log
collection, file integrity monitoring, custom security rules, and
more. This post dives into how to use it.
