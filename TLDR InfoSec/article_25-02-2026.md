 THE DARK SIDE OF AI: 2.6MM UNDERGROUND MESSAGES ANALYZED (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Flashpoint just released a massive study of the AI threat landscape.
Analysts monitored over 2.6 MILLION AI-RELATED POSTS across Telegram,
the dark web, and underground LLM forums.

The findings are a wake-up call [4]. Threat actors are no longer just
"experimenting" — they are deploying:

 	* DEEPFAKE-AS-A-SERVICE for sophisticated social engineering.
 	* MULTILINGUAL PHISHING KITS that erase language barriers.
 	* FRAUD-GPTS: Custom LLMs fine-tuned specifically for malicious
activity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 IRAN'S MUDDYWATER TARGETS ORGS WITH FRESH MALWARE AS TENSIONS MOUNT
(4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Iran's MuddyWater (TA450) launched Operation Olalampo, a
spear-phishing campaign delivering multiple novel malware strains —
including the Rust-based Char backdoor using Telegram for C2, the
GhostFetch/GhostBackDoor loader chain, and the HTTP_VIP downloader —
against organizations across the Middle East and Africa. Group-IB
identified signs of AI-assisted development in Char's command
handlers, including debug strings containing emojis that were likely
left unsanitized in LLM-generated code segments. Defenders should
leverage the published IoCs, YARA rules, and EDR rules to detect
activity, while monitoring for unauthorized AnyDesk deployments and
Telegram-based C2 traffic. 

 THE DJI ROMO ROBOVAC HAD SECURITY SO POOR, THIS MAN REMOTELY ACCESSED
THOUSANDS OF THEM (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security researcher found that DJI's Romo robot vacuum lacked MQTT
authentication, allowing any client to connect to DJI's servers and
pull telemetry from roughly 7,000 devices across 24 countries. Live
camera feeds, microphone access, 2D floor plans, and serial numbers
were all available. In under 9 minutes, the researcher cataloged over
6,700 devices and collected more than 100,000 MQTT messages, revealing
precise home layouts and approximate device locations via IP
geolocation. DJI has reportedly closed the immediate access gap.
Still, the deeper problem remains: the device-to-cloud channel trusts
any authenticated session as a legitimate owner, a fundamental IoT
authorization failure. 

 CONDUENT DATA BREACH GROWS, AFFECTING AT LEAST 25M PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A ransomware attack on outsourcing giant Conduent has exposed
personal data on at least 25 million people across multiple states in
the US, including Oregon and Texas. Stolen information includes names,
Social Security numbers, health insurance, and medical data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A BUG IS A BUG, BUT A PATCH IS A POLICY: THE CASE FOR BOOTABLE
CONTAINERS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Linux kernel CNA now assigns CVEs to nearly every bug fix, often
without CVSS scores, and that decision has shattered the classic
“patch anything above 7.0 within 30 days” compliance model.
Security teams must now pick between expensive manual triage and just
patching everything fast. Bootable containers (bootc) offer a middle
path: they package the entire OS (kernel, drivers, and user-space) as
an immutable container image with atomic updates and automatic
rollback when health checks fail, which kills the reboot anxiety that
causes update fatigue. The real shift is moving vulnerability
management away from spreadsheet-driven CVSS triage toward
build-file-scoped scanning of minimal images, turning patching into a
routine CI/CD pipeline step rather than a high-stakes manual event. 

 DETECTING AND PREVENTING DISTILLATION ATTACKS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anthropic identified industrial-scale distillation campaigns by
DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax that generated over 16 million
exchanges across roughly 24,000 fraudulent accounts to extract
Claude's agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding capabilities for
training their own models. The labs used proxy services operating
“hydra cluster” architectures with thousands of coordinated
accounts to circumvent regional access restrictions, with MiniMax
pivoting within 24 hours to target new model releases and DeepSeek
specifically extracting chain-of-thought data and censorship-safe
alternatives to politically sensitive queries. Anthropic has deployed
behavioral fingerprinting classifiers, strengthened account
verification, and is sharing technical indicators with other labs and
authorities, warning that illicitly distilled models strip safety
guardrails and undermine export controls. 

 TURN DEPENDABOT OFF (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Dependabot floods teams with noisy pull requests and misleading
security alerts, and in Go projects, it rarely improves actual
security. Filippo Valsorda breaks down why: the alerts often have no
bearing on real risk, offer no package- or symbol-level filtering, and
generate enough alert fatigue that teams start ignoring everything,
including the alerts that matter. His recommended setup uses two
scheduled GitHub Actions instead. The first runs govulncheck for
reachability-based vulnerability scanning. The second runs tests daily
against the latest dependency versions to catch breakage early without
forcing constant upgrades. Together, they cut through the noise, slash
false positives, and let teams take genuine security findings
seriously.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 YOUR BIGGEST RISK ISN'T A VULNERABILITY. IT'S A PATH (SPONSOR) [11] 

 A single misconfiguration rarely causes a breach. It's the chain —
the quiet connections between identities, roles, and systems — that
creates opportunity. Attack Path Management shows you those chains in
full context. Take SpecterOps' quick assessment [11] to see where your
program falls on the maturity spectrum and access the MATURITY MODEL
REPORT [12] for clear guidance to reduce attack paths. 

 AIKIDO SAFE CHAIN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Aikido Safe Chain is a lightweight local proxy that intercepts npm
and PyPI package downloads, checking them in real-time against Aikido
Intel threat intelligence to block malware before it reaches developer
machines or CI/CD pipelines. It supports npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, pip,
uv, and poetry via shell aliases, and temporarily suppresses npm
packages published within the last 24 hours by default to catch
undetected threats during the highest-risk window. Installation is
tokenless and requires no build data sharing, with native CI/CD
support for GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, GitLab, Jenkins,
CircleCI, and Bitbucket. 

 ADAPTIVE SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Adaptive Security is an AI-powered platform that simulates deepfake
and impersonation attacks across email, voice, and messaging to expose
weak controls. It also delivers personalized training and policy
enforcement to help employees detect and resist AI-driven social
engineering threats. 

 HIJAGGER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Hijagger checks all maintainers of all npm and PyPi packages for
hijackable packages through domain re-registration.

 CLOUDFLARE ONE IS THE FIRST SASE OFFERING MODERN POST-QUANTUM
ENCRYPTION ACROSS THE FULL PLATFORM (12 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cloudflare One is the first SASE platform to support
standards-compliant post-quantum hybrid ML-KEM encryption across all
major on-ramps and off-ramps, including its Secure Web Gateway, Zero
Trust, and WAN use cases. The upgrade extends post-quantum protection
to Cloudflare IPsec (now in closed beta) and the Cloudflare One
Appliance (GA in version 2026.2.0), defending enterprise traffic
against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks ahead of NIST's 2030
deadline for deprecating RSA and ECC. The implementation follows the
draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-mlkem specification rather than proprietary
approaches, and is available at no extra cost. 

 KOREAN COPS CHARGE TEENS OVER BIKE HIRE BREACH THAT EXPOSED DATA ON
4.62M RIDERS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 South Korean police charged two teens for breaching Seoul's
Ttareungyi bike rental system in 2024, accessing data on 4.62 million
of 5 million users, including contact and personal details.
Investigators say the pair met on Telegram, hacked while still in
middle school, and intended to profit, though there's no evidence the
data was sold. 

 WHY THE KEEPASS FORMAT SHOULD BE BASED ON SQLITE (8 MINUTE READ) [18]


 KDBX's XML-based format has built up serious technical debt through a
fragmented “shadow schema,” in which TOTP, passkeys, and autofill
data have been shoehorned into custom attributes across incompatible
client implementations. Migrating to SQLite with SQLCipher would fix
this: page-level writes, lower memory overhead for large vaults, and a
clean schema that treats modern credential types as first-class
citizens rather than afterthoughts. The post also calls for a
governance overhaul, pushing KeePassXC and major mobile clients to
jointly define a new spec rather than continuing under a benevolent
dictator model.
