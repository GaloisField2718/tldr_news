 BUILDING TO PREVENT SUBDOMAIN TAKEOVERS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post discusses architectural decisions that can be made by
platforms offering custom domains to proactively prevent subdomain
takeovers. The most common mitigation method employed is requiring
domain verification, which is most commonly implemented as a TXT
record with a verification string. Other mechanisms suggested are to
add entropy to the underlying record to make it difficult to generate
an identical record, preventing the re-registration of custom domains,
and charging for custom domains.
