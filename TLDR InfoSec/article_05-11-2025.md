 INSIDE THE 3 A.M. CYBER CRISIS: _WAKE UP!_ BY VEEAM (SPONSOR) [4] 

Cybersecurity isn't just about ransomware, phishing, and attack paths.
It's about the people, culture, and choices that happen when an attack
strikes — often at the worst possible time.

_Wake Up!_ by Veeam gives you an exclusive peak behind the curtain:
raw, first-hand stories from CISOs and security leaders who faced the
3 a.m. wake-up call — and survived to tell the tale.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OPERATION SKYCLOAK DEPLOYS TOR-ENABLED OPENSSH BACKDOOR TARGETING
DEFENSE SECTORS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Operation SkyCloak uses phishing emails with military document lures
to deploy sophisticated backdoors targeting defense sectors in Russia
and Belarus, establishing persistent access through legitimate OpenSSH
services and customized Tor hidden services with obfs4 traffic
obfuscation. The malware performs environmental checks to evade
sandboxes, creates scheduled tasks for persistence, and enables remote
access to critical Windows services (RDP, SSH, and SMB) through
anonymous Tor addresses using pre-installed cryptographic keys.
Security professionals should monitor for unusual scheduled tasks
named after legitimate applications, implement network monitoring for
Tor traffic patterns, and enhance email security controls to detect
phishing campaigns using military-themed lures targeting defense
organizations. 

 INSIDE INDIA'S VOYEUR WEB: 80 CCTV DASHBOARDS HACKED ACROSS 20 STATES
(2 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Investigators in India discovered a cybercrime ring that hacked into
80 CCTV dashboards across schools, hospitals, and homes and sold clips
to an international porn fetish network. The attackers were able to
access the dashboards because they used default passwords such as
‘admin123'. 

 MEDIA GIANT NIKKEI REPORTS DATA BREACH IMPACTING 17K PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Japanese publishing giant Nikkei, which owns international brands
such as The Financial Times, reported that its Slack platform was
breached. An account was breached via stolen credentials from an
employee's computer. Messages sent by over 17K members of the Slack
organization were stolen. Nikkei stated that no data related to
confidential sources was available.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURITY LEADERSHIP MASTER CLASS 1: LEVELING UP YOUR LEADERSHIP (4
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Effective security leaders understand that they must act like a
business executive, not an IT manager, and must focus on creating a
high-level strategy, master business-oriented communication, manage
executive expectations, and proactively communicate successes and
manage the maritime. Security leaders should also work at the team
level to build resilient teams, develop scalable systems, prioritize
areas that require more effort, take personal accountability, and
engage with the professional community. This is part one of a 7 part
series by Phil Venables on security leadership. 

 DEFEATING KASLR BY DOING NOTHING AT ALL (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) on Android ARM64
devices can be completely bypassed without any exploits due to the
Linux kernel's linear mapping being placed at a predictable virtual
address (0xffffff8000000000) and Pixel phones loading the kernel at a
static physical address (0x80010000). This allows attackers to
calculate exact kernel virtual addresses for any data structure using
simple arithmetic, effectively nullifying KASLR's protection against
local kernel exploits on affected devices. The vulnerability stems
from engineering decisions that prioritize memory hot-plugging support
over security randomization, with both the Linux kernel team and
Google considering this intended behavior and having no immediate
plans for mitigation. 

 SESAMEOP: NOVEL BACKDOOR USES OPENAI ASSISTANTS API FOR COMMAND AND
CONTROL (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new cybersecurity threat called SesameOp leverages the OpenAI
Assistants API as a covert channel for command and control, allowing
attackers to communicate with malware undetected. By embedding its
communication within legitimate API traffic, SesameOp enables
persistent access and remote control of compromised systems while
evading traditional detection methods. It achieves this by leveraging
obfuscated code, secure encryption, and creative misuse of built-in
API functionality, rather than exploiting specific software
vulnerabilities.

 NETVISOR (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 netVisor is an open-source network topology discovery and
visualization tool that automatically scans networks to identify
hosts, services, and their relationships, generating interactive
documentation of network infrastructure. The tool employs a
server-daemon architecture, where lightweight agents perform network
scanning from multiple vantage points (supporting VLAN mapping) and
report to a central PostgreSQL-backed server. This server generates
visual topology maps, automatically detecting over 50 common services,
including virtualization platforms, network infrastructure, and
security tools. Security teams can leverage this for asset inventory,
network segmentation validation, and maintaining up-to-date network
documentation without the need for manual diagramming. 

 SLOPGUARD (GITHUB REPO) [18] 

 SlopGuard detects AI-hallucinated packages, typosquatting, and supply
chain attacks with automated trust scoring. Zero maintenance, <3%
false positives, and multi-ecosystem support 

 NEON CYBER (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [19] 

 Neon Cyber protects organizations by embedding a browser extension on
managed devices, providing real-time protection against phishing and
insider threats. It delivers deep visibility into user actions in the
browser, following threats and giving analysts a complete forensic
context without adding user friction.

 MALICIOUS VSX EXTENSION "SLEEPYDUCK" USES ETHEREUM TO KEEP ITS
COMMAND SERVER ALIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The SleepyDuck malware, disguised as a legitimate Solidity extension
for Visual Studio Code, uses an innovative Ethereum smart
contract-based command and control infrastructure to maintain
persistent access even if primary servers are taken down. The malware
activates when opening .sol files, connects to Ethereum RPC providers
to communicate with contract address
0xDAfb81732db454DA238e9cFC9A9Fe5fb8e34c465, and polls for commands
every 30 seconds while collecting system information and providing
remote access capabilities. Security professionals should implement
strict extension vetting processes, monitor network traffic for
Ethereum RPC connections originating from development environments,
and establish policies that require extensions to be sourced only from
verified publishers with established reputations. 

 US CYBERSECURITY EXPERTS INDICTED FOR BLACKCAT RANSOMWARE ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Three former cybersecurity incident response professionals from
DigitalMint and Sygnia face federal indictment for allegedly operating
as BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware affiliates, attacking five US
organizations between May and November 2023 with ransom demands
ranging from $300,000 to $10 million. The defendants exploited their
insider positions as ransomware negotiators and incident response
managers to gain unauthorized network access, steal data, deploy
encryption malware, and demand cryptocurrency payments while only
successfully extracting $1.27 million from one Tampa medical device
manufacturer. Security teams should scrutinize third-party incident
response providers and implement strict access controls. This case
highlights the severe risk of insider threats when trusted security
professionals abuse privileged access for financial gain. 

 MIT SLOAN QUIETLY SHELVES AI RANSOMWARE STUDY AFTER RESEARCHER CALLS
BS (3 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 MIT Sloan has withdrawn a paper claiming that over 80% of ransomware
attacks are AI-driven following strong criticism by cybersecurity
experts who found its claims unsubstantiated and its evidence lacking.
Critics argued the research exaggerated AI's role in cyberattacks and
pointed to possible conflicts of interest, causing MIT to promise an
updated version.
