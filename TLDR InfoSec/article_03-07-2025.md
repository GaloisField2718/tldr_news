ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 QANTAS CONFIRMS MAJOR DATA BREACH LINKED TO THIRD-PARTY VENDOR (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Qantas confirmed a data breach on July 1 after attackers accessed a
third-party call center platform, potentially exposing records of up
to 6 million customers, including names, email addresses, phone
numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers. The attack is
linked to the hacking group Scattered Spider, which has targeted
airlines like Hawaiian Airlines and WestJet using social engineering
to trick staff into system access. While no financial data, passwords,
or passports were compromised, the incident underscores airline
vulnerability during peak travel and the rising threat of supply chain
attacks on aviation. 

 FORMINATOR PLUGIN FLAW EXPOSES WORDPRESS SITES TO TAKEOVER ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The WordPress Forminator plugin (versions up to 1.44.2) contains a
critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-6463, CVSS 8.8) that affects 600,000+
sites. Attackers can exploit insufficient input validation to delete
critical files like wp-config.php, forcing sites into setup mode for
complete takeover. Version 1.44.3 patches this flaw—immediate
updates are essential. 

 CYBERATTACK TARGETS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The International Criminal Court (ICC) was hit by a "sophisticated
and targeted cyber security incident" last week, marking the second
major attack in two years. The intrusion was quickly detected and
contained. The timing coincides with NATO leaders meeting in The Hague
and ongoing high-profile cases involving arrest warrants for Putin,
Netanyahu, and Hamas leaders.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHY EVERY COMPANY NEEDS A TRAVEL SECURITY PROGRAM (4 MINUTE READ) [8]


 Companies need comprehensive travel security programs due to rising
geopolitical risks like device inspections, surveillance, and
espionage. Key strategies include using clean loaner devices,
employing strong encryption with non-biometric passphrases, utilizing
VPNs, implementing MFA, and powering down devices before crossing
borders. Organizations should conduct pre-travel risk assessments,
provide geopolitical briefings, establish 24/7 traveler support, and
maintain clear documentation policies to safeguard data and ensure
business continuity. 

 ESCAPEROUTE: BREAKING THE SCOPE OF ANTHROPIC'S FILESYSTEM MCP SERVER
(CVE-2025-53109 & CVE-2025-53110) (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cymulate Research Labs discovered critical vulnerabilities in
Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) Filesystem Server. Two
high-severity flaws (CVE-2025-53110 and CVE-2025-53109) allow
attackers to escape sandboxes, access any host files, and execute
arbitrary code through directory containment bypass and symlink
exploitation. 

 AUTHENTICATION METHODS: CHOOSING THE RIGHT TYPE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Password-based authentication is vulnerable to various common
attacks, including password reuse, weak passwords, and phishing. To
combat these threats, this guide from the NCSC guides on “going
beyond passwords” with MFA, federated Single Sign-On (SSO), FIDO 2
security keys, or magic links and one-time passwords (OTPs). Each
section includes an introduction to the method, its pros and cons, and
a chart to help determine when you may want to use it and when you may
want to consider a different method.

 TOP FBI CYBER OFFICIAL: SALT TYPHOON ‘LARGELY CONTAINED' IN TELECOM
NETWORKS (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 According to the FBI's top cyber official, Brett Leatherman, the
Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon is "largely contained" and
"dormant" in telecommunications networks, with nine U.S. telecom
companies having been victimized. However, the hackers still pose a
threat, as they could pivot from espionage to destructive action.
Leatherman noted that Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon are more similar
than some think, as both have access to critical infrastructure that
could support destructive operations.
