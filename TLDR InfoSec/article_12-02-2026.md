ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW 'ZERODAYRAT' SPYWARE KIT ENABLES TOTAL COMPROMISE OF IOS, ANDROID
DEVICES (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A new commercial mobile spyware toolkit, ZeroDayRAT, sold via
Telegram and analyzed by iVerify, offers nation-state-level
capabilities, including live camera and microphone feeds, keylogging,
GPS tracking, bank credential theft, and crypto clipboard hijacking,
for both Android and iOS devices. The self-hosted kit uses a builder
model in which operators generate payloads for their own
infrastructure, distributing them via phishing, smishing, or
trojanized apps. The creators deliberately obscure attribution by
advertising in five languages and mixing Chinese, Russian, and Indian
targeting indicators. Takedown efforts have been complicated by the
decentralized operator model and Telegram's slow enforcement, making
this a persistent threat with few available IoCs beyond unusual
battery drain and unexplained financial transactions. 

 SOMEONE'S ATTACKING SOLARWINDS WHD TO STEAL HIGH-PRIVILEGE
CREDENTIALS - BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO OR HOW (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Unknown threat actors exploited vulnerable SolarWinds Web Help Desk
instances in December 2025 to gain initial access, with Microsoft
unable to confirm whether the attacks leveraged CVE-2025-40551 (9.8
CVSS deserialization RCE), CVE-2025-40536 (8.1 CVSS auth bypass), or
CVE-2025-26399 (9.8 CVSS command execution). Post-exploitation
activity included BITS abuse for payload delivery, installation of
Zoho ManageEngine RMM for persistence, LSASS credential dumping via
DLL sideloading, and DCSync attacks to extract domain controller
password data. Organizations should immediately patch WHD, remove
public access to admin paths, scan for unauthorized RMM tools such as
ToolsIQ.exe, and rotate service and admin account credentials
accessible from WHD. 

 CLAWHAVOC: 341 MALICIOUS CLAWED SKILLS FOUND BY THE BOT THEY WERE
TARGETING (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Koi Security's threat hunting agent analyzed skills being offered on
OpenClaw's ClawHub marketplace and discovered that 341/2857 of them
were malicious. Most malicious extensions follow a similar pattern:
the prerequisites instruct the agent to download and execute a file
containing a malicious payload that installs the AMOS stealer. The
post also highlights a few unique skills that download other payloads
or hide their stealers and backdoors within the code itself.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RANSOMWARE FRANCHISE WARS: HOW FALLING PAYMENTS ARE SPAWNING A
NEW GENERATION OF CYBERCRIME CARTELS (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The collapses of Black Basta and LockBit have triggered a violent
restructuring of the RaaS ecosystem, with new entrants like
DragonForce operating as vertically integrated "cartels" that embed
access broker marketplaces directly into affiliate panels, compressing
the window between initial access and ransomware deployment to hours.
A parallel commoditization of EDR evasion tools, including BYOVD-based
killers exploiting a still-valid 2006 Microsoft-signed driver, has
collapsed the barrier to entry so that even low-budget operators can
defeat enterprise security stacks. Defenders should prioritize
enabling Microsoft's opt-in Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, monitor
access broker marketplaces for organizational exposure, and shift
threat intelligence from tracking ransomware brands to tracking
persistent infrastructure indicators like shared SSH fingerprints and
certificate reuse. 

 VOIDLINK: DISSECTING AN AI-GENERATED C2 IMPLANT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 VoidLink is a Zig-based Linux C2 implant that bears strong indicators
of LLM-generated code — including structured "Phase X:" labels,
verbose debug logging, and documentation patterns left in the
production binary — demonstrating how AI coding agents are lowering
the barrier to producing functional, multi-cloud malware. The implant
fingerprints AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud
environments, harvests credentials from environment variables and
metadata APIs, performs container escape via Docker/Kubernetes
plugins, and deploys an adaptive kernel-level rootkit that selects
eBPF, LKM, or LD_PRELOAD stealth based on host kernel version.
Defenders should monitor for unauthorized cloud metadata API queries
from workloads, audit Kubernetes service account token access, and
treat verbose or structured debug artifacts in captured malware as
potential indicators of AI-assisted development requiring adjusted
threat modeling. 

 WHEN MFA WASN'T ENOUGH: A REAL AITM INCIDENT REVIEW (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Attackers have shifted from credential theft to stealing
authentication tokens for initial access. In one incident that the
author observed, an attacker successfully stole an authentication
token via an attacker-in-the-middle (AitM) Microsoft 365 proxy, but
couldn't achieve their goals due to rapid detection and response. In a
second incident, the attacker was unable to steal a token because the
organization utilized FIDO2 security keys, so the authentication
attempt through the AitM proxy failed.

 UNC1069 TARGETS CRYPTOCURRENCY SECTOR WITH NEW TOOLING AND AI-ENABLED
SOCIAL ENGINEERING (15 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Mandiant attributed an intrusion against a FinTech entity to UNC1069,
a DPRK-nexus financially motivated threat actor that leveraged a
compromised Telegram account, a spoofed Zoom meeting with a reported
deepfake video, and a ClickFix attack to deploy seven malware families
on a macOS device — including new tools SILENCELIFT, DEEPBREATH, and
CHROMEPUSH. The attack chain progressed from the WAVESHAPER backdoor
through the HYPERCALL downloader to deploy HIDDENCALL for hands-on
keyboard access, while DEEPBREATH bypassed macOS TCC protections to
steal Keychain credentials, browser data, and Telegram sessions, and
CHROMEPUSH installed a malicious Chrome extension for keylogging and
cookie theft. The investigation highlights UNC1069's expanding use of
GenAI tools like Gemini and GPT-4o for social engineering, alongside a
significant tooling refresh targeting cryptocurrency startups,
software developers, and venture capital firms. 

 MICROSOFT ROLLS OUT NEW SECURE BOOT CERTIFICATES BEFORE JUNE
EXPIRATION (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The certificates that Microsoft uses for Secure Boot are set to
expire in June 2026 after 15 years of use. Users who have automatic
updates enabled will receive the new updates automatically. Admins can
deploy the new certificates via registry keys, Group Policy, or
Windows Configuration System (WinCS). Windows 10 users who are not
enrolled in extended security updates will not receive the new
certificates. 

 REYNOLDS RANSOMWARE EMBEDS BYOVD DRIVER TO DISABLE EDR SECURITY TOOLS
(5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Reynolds ransomware bundles a vulnerable NsecSoft NSecKrnl driver
(CVE-2025-68947, CVSS 5.7) directly in its payload to terminate EDR
processes from CrowdStrike, Sophos, Symantec, Palo Alto Cortex XDR,
and Avast before encrypting files, eliminating the need for a separate
BYOVD deployment step. Symantec and Carbon Black researchers noted a
suspicious side-loaded loader on the target network weeks before
ransomware execution, followed by deployment of the GotoHTTP remote
access tool for persistent access. The article also covers broader
ransomware developments, including LockBit 5.0's shift to ChaCha20
encryption with wiper capabilities, Interlock's use of a gaming driver
zero-day (CVE-2025-61155) for BYOVD attacks, and ransomware actors
increasingly targeting misconfigured AWS S3 buckets.
