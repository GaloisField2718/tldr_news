ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VANTA BUG EXPOSED CUSTOMERS' DATA TO OTHER CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Vanta experienced a data breach affecting fewer than 4% of its
10,000+ customers due to a product code bug, not an intrusion. The
incident exposed employee account data, including names, roles, and
security configurations between customer instances. Vanta identified
the issue on May 26 and will complete remediation by June 4. 

 US COMMUNITY BANK SAYS THIEVES DRAINED CUSTOMER DATA THROUGH
THIRD-PARTY HOLE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 MainStreet Bancshares disclosed that hackers stole data from 4.65% of
its customer base through a third-party vendor attack in March. The
bank's own systems weren't compromised. 

 QUALCOMM FIXES THREE ADRENO GPU ZERO-DAYS EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Qualcomm has patched three zero-day vulnerabilities in its Adreno GPU
driver that are being actively exploited in targeted attacks.
CVE-2025-21479 and CVE-2025-21480 cause memory corruption through
unauthorized GPU command execution and CVE-2025-27038 is a
use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's graphics rendering. Google's
Threat Analysis Group confirmed these vulnerabilities are under
limited, targeted exploitation, and Qualcomm provided patches to
device manufacturers in May with urgent deployment recommendations.
This continues a pattern of Qualcomm chipset vulnerabilities being
exploited by threat actors, including a previous zero-day used by
Serbian authorities with Cellebrite software to unlock activists' and
journalists' Android devices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BEYOND HTTP: INTERCEPTSUITE FOR TCP/TLS TRAFFIC INTERCEPTION IN
WINDOWS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 InterceptSuite is a Windows network traffic analysis tool that
intercepts and decrypts any TCP/TLS protocol communications, not just
HTTP/HTTPS like existing tools. Built with C/OpenSSL and C#/.NET, it
operates as a SOCKS5 proxy enabling real-time viewing and modification
of encrypted traffic for security testing and application debugging.
This blog dives into it and how it can be used. 

 GETTING THE MOST VALUE OUT OF THE OSCP: AFTER THE EXAM (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This is a guide on maximizing value from the OSCP certification
journey post-exam. It focuses on three actions: reflecting on exam
performance to pinpoint weaknesses for targeted study plans,
networking with professionals and peers via Discord servers and
cybersecurity communities, and reassessing career goals to decide next
steps. The author recommends a structured retrospective approach that
includes data collection (timeline reconstruction and machine
breakdowns), analysis (identifying operational hurdles and technical
gaps), and reconstruction (developing focused practice plans and
strategies). For new professionals, it suggests taking a break,
updating resumes, exploring advanced topics like web applications or
Active Directory, and considering related fields such as DevSecOps,
SOC analysis, or detection engineering based on personal interests. 

 THREAT GROUP ASSESSMENT: MUDDLED LIBRA (UPDATED MAY 16, 2025) (11
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Muddled Libra, a threat group specializing in social engineering
attacks using the 0ktapus phishing kit, targets organizations in
software automation, BPO, telecommunications, and technology,
particularly large outsourcing firms for high-value cryptocurrency
institutions. The group shows deep knowledge of enterprise IT systems
and utilizes a comprehensive toolkit, including smishing, MFA bombing,
help desk social engineering, and commercial remote monitoring tools
to maintain access and evade detection. Its main goal is data theft
for supply chain attacks, leveraging stolen information from initial
victims to infiltrate downstream customer environments.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PROTECTING HIGH-PROFILE INDIVIDUALS USING OSINT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Online threats against high-profile individuals can escalate into
real-world harassment or even physical harm. This is growing more
urgent due to geopolitical tensions, AI-powered deepfakes [11], and
exploitable vulnerabilities. Learn how to use OSINT to identify these
threats and take preventive action in Flashpoint's Complete Guide to
OSINT for Executive Protection [11]. 

 WITNESS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Witness is a pluggable framework for software supply chain risk
management. It automates, normalizes, and verifies software artifact
provenance. 

 CRADLE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Cradle is a cutting-edge open-source threat intelligence platform
created by Prodaft and designed for collaborative analysis,
visualization of entities and relationships, and report generation.
The Cradle platform can be deployed using Docker and Compose,
comprising a Python and Django backend, with an Electron and React
frontend. It employs Redis and Postgres as its data storage solutions.


 MARKITDOWN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 MarkItDown is a lightweight Python tool designed to convert various
files into Markdown format for use with LLMs and text analysis
workflows. It is most comparable to textract, but specifically aims to
maintain key document structures and content in Markdown (such as
headings, lists, tables, links, etc). Although the output is generally
presentable and user-friendly, it is primarily intended for text
analysis tools, and may not be ideal for high-fidelity document
conversions intended for human readers.

 ‘RUSSIAN MARKET' EMERGES AS A GO-TO SHOP FOR STOLEN CREDENTIALS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The "Russian Market" cybercrime marketplace has become a leading
platform for buying and selling stolen credentials, with logs
available for as low as $2 and containing data from
information-stealing malware, including passwords, session cookies,
and credit card details. The marketplace has grown significantly
following the takedown of Genesis Market, with 61% of stolen logs
containing enterprise SaaS credentials from platforms like Google
Workspace and Salesforce, and 77% including single sign-on
credentials. Lumma stealer previously dominated 92% of the market but
faces disruption from recent law enforcement actions, while a new
stealer called Acreed is rapidly gaining traction with over 4,000 logs
uploaded in its first week. 

 CARTIER DISCLOSES DATA BREACH AMID FASHION BRAND CYBERATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cartier reported a data breach where hackers accessed customer
information, including names, emails, and countries. However, no
passwords or payment details were compromised. Other fashion brands
like Dior and Adidas have experienced similar cyberattacks recently. 

 TRUMP BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD SLASH MORE THAN 1,000 CISA JOBS (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The fiscal 2026 budget proposal from President Donald Trump would cut
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency workforce by
eliminating 1,083 positions and reducing its budget by $495 million to
$2.4 billion. This cut is slightly deeper than earlier forecasts. A
new document from the Department of Homeland Security details the CISA
personnel reductions and shows planned decreases in other federal
cybersecurity programs.
