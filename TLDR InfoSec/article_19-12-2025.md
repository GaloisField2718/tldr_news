 THE AFTERMATH OF A FAILED DDOS ATTACK DURING A MULTI-PETABYTE TRAFFIC
SURGE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers couldn't have chosen a better moment to strike Fastly
[4]:  As major customers shifted tens of petabytes of traffic to
Fastly due to another provider's outage, several advanced DDoS attacks
were unleashed on our platform…yet there was no end-user
disruption. 

Fastly's architectural choices, operational discipline, and commitment
to continual refinement built a platform that is always prepared for
the worst. Now, in a detailed analysis [4], Fastly is sharing the
secret to its resilience.

Read the blog [4] to learn how to make resilience a design principle.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TWO CHROME FLAWS COULD BE TRIGGERED BY SIMPLY BROWSING THE WEB:
UPDATE NOW (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Google patched two Chrome vulnerabilities exploitable via malicious
web pages: a use-after-free in WebGPU (CVE-2025-14765) that enabled
heap corruption, and an out-of-bounds read/write in the V8 JavaScript
engine (CVE-2025-14766). Both flaws affect Chrome's 3.4 billion users
and require no user interaction beyond visiting a crafted site. Update
to version 143.0.7499.146 or later immediately. 

 113,000 IMPACTED BY DATA BREACH AT VIRGINIA MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITY
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Richmond Behavioral Health Authority in Virginia was hit by a
ransomware attack in late September that encrypted parts of its
network and revealed data on more than 113,000 individuals, including
names, Social Security numbers, passport information, and financial
and health details. Victims are advised to monitor their accounts and
credit reports closely, as the ransomware group Qilin claims to have
leaked 192 GB of stolen data. 

 HPE ONEVIEW FLAW RATED CVSS 10.0 ALLOWS UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE CODE
EXECUTION (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hewlett Packard Enterprise has patched a critical remote code
execution vulnerability in HPE OneView, tracked as CVE-2025-37164 with
a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, that allows unauthenticated attackers to
execute code remotely. The flaw affects all versions before 11.00,
making prompt patching essential to prevent exploitation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE RASPBERRY PI WAKEUP CALL: WHY ENTERPRISES MUST RETHINK PHYSICAL
SECURITY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A recent Raspberry Pi attack attempt on a French ferry highlights how
rogue devices with cellular modems can bypass traditional network
monitoring by creating their own internet connection from inside the
perimeter. Analysts estimate 50% of enterprises remain vulnerable to
similar physical attacks due to unsecured Ethernet ports and
inadequate device authentication. Organizations should disable unused
ports by default, implement 802.1X authentication, deploy physical
layer fingerprinting tools, and monitor for external infrastructure
connections when unknown devices appear. 

 FROM LINEAR TO COMPLEX: AN UPGRADE IN RANSOMHOUSE ENCRYPTION (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Unit 42 analyzed the upgraded Mario encryptor used by the RansomHouse
ransomware, which evolved from simple single-pass encryption to a
two-factor scheme that uses both primary and secondary keys, with
chunked file processing. The RaaS operation, tracked as Jolly
Scorpius, specifically targets VMware ESXi infrastructure, using the
MrAgent deployment tool to encrypt multiple virtual machines
simultaneously. The enhanced encryption methodology, with non-linear
file processing and dynamic chunk sizing, significantly complicates
static analysis and decryption for defenders. 

 DEFENDING AGAINST THE CVE-2025-55182 (REACT2SHELL) VULNERABILITY IN
REACT SERVER COMPONENTS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CVE-2025-55182, also known as React2Shell, is a critical remote code
execution vulnerability in React Server Components and frameworks such
as Next.js that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with a
single malicious HTTP request on vulnerable servers. Default
configurations are affected and reliable public exploits exist.
Attackers can gain initial access without authentication and then
deploy tools such as reverse shells, RATs, cryptominers, and
credential harvesters across Windows and Linux environments.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 32% OF LLM PENTEST FINDINGS ARE HIGH RISK, YET 79% REMAIN UNPATCHED:
COBALT REPORT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Security folks say genAI threats are a top concern, but few have the
LLM and AI-powered security testing they need to address this novel
risk. Cobalt's State of LLM Security Report 2025 [11] lays out the key
LLM vulnerabilities, along with concrete recommendations for security
teams. See the full findings [11] 

 MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PACKAGES DATASET (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Datadog released an open-source dataset of over 17,000 malicious npm
and PyPI packages identified through their GuardDog tool, categorized
by ecosystem and whether they were compromised legitimate packages or
published with malicious intent. 

 WIREBROWSER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Wirebrowser is an open-source debugging and interception toolkit
built on Chrome DevTools Protocol that combines network manipulation,
API testing, and deep JavaScript memory inspection. Key features
include Live Object Search for runtime patching of JS objects and
Origin Trace (BDHS) for identifying user-land functions responsible
for object creation or mutation through automated heap snapshots. 

 VERISOUL (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Verisoul provides an all‑in‑one fraud prevention platform that
detects and blocks fake accounts and bots across the entire user
lifecycle using device fingerprinting, behavioral analysis, and
AI‑driven risk scoring to protect platforms from AI‑powered abuse
and payment fraud.

 I GOT HACKED, MY SERVER STARTED MINING MONERO THIS MORNING (9 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 A developer's Umami analytics container was exploited via
CVE-2025-66478, a Next.js React Server Components deserialization
flaw, resulting in Monero cryptominers running undetected for 10 days.
Container isolation prevented the compromise from spreading because
the container ran as non-root with no volume mounts or privileged
access. The incident highlights the importance of knowing your
dependencies' underlying frameworks and properly configuring container
security boundaries. 

 TECH PROVIDER FOR NHS ENGLAND CONFIRMS DATA BREACH (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 UK healthcare tech firm DXS International has reported a cyberattack
on its office servers serving NHS England. Services will remain
operational while the scope of any data theft is under investigation.
A ransomware group called DevMan claims to have stolen 300 GB of data.
Authorities, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office and
law enforcement, have been notified. 

 IN CYBERSECURITY, CLAUDE LEAVES OTHER LLMS IN THE DUST (5 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Anthropic's Claude models outperform rival LLMs on jailbreak
resistance, prompt injection defenses, and limiting harmful or
misleading outputs. While most vendors show mediocre and slow safety
progress, Claude 4.x scores around 75–80% on jailbreak tests and
nearly perfect on harmful content refusal, largely because Anthropic
bakes safety alignment deeply into the training process instead of
adding it as a final layer.
