 PYPI PACKAGE WITH 100K INSTALLS PIRATED MUSIC FROM DEEZER FOR YEARS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Socket has discovered a malicious Python package called automslc that
pirates music from the Deezer streaming service via hardcoded
credentials. The automslc package utilized user supplies credentials
to login to Deezer or hardcoded credentials and stores downloaded

 VSCODE EXTENSIONS WITH 9M INSTALLS PULLED OVER SECURITY RISKS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two security researchers reported the ‘Material Theme - Free' and
‘Material Theme Icons - Free' to Microsoft because they seemed
malicious. BleepingComputer found a heavily obfuscated
release-notes.js file that upon partial deobfuscation makes reference
to usernames and passwords in several places. The author of the themes
denies any malicious intent and states that a dependency may have been
compromised but that Microsoft should have alerted them instead of
removing the package.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 STREAMLINING VULNERABILITY RESEARCH WITH IDA PRO AND RUST (8 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Marco Ivaldi of HN Security has released new tools in Rust for
reverse engineering and vulnerability research in IDA Pro that
leverage the IDA SDK and Binarly's idalib Rust bindings for a faster
user experience. These tools, which include rhabdomancer and haruspex,
help locate potentially insecure API calls and extract pseudo-code for
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of vulnerability research efforts.
The availability of idalib opens up opportunities for developers to
create standalone analysis tools in Rust, expanding the capabilities
of IDA Pro in security research. 

 TURBO INTRUDER SCRIPTS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A collection of Turbo Intruder scripts to emulate the 4 main types of
Burp Intruder attacks - battering ram, cluster bomb, pitchfork, and

 AN ICLOUD BACKDOOR WOULD MAKE OUR PHONES LESS SAFE (5 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 The UK government asking Apple to create a backdoor in iCloud could
put everyone's data at risk. This could perhaps be a coordinated
effort with other “Five Eyes” countries of the United States,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand: the rich English-language-speaking
spying club. Everyone can help with privacy and support companies like
Apple not buckle down by enabling the Advanced Protection feature as
well as being proactively involved in the policy front. 

 HOW AI IS CHANGING SECURITY OPERATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This blog post highlights some of the challenges that AI brings to
the SecOps field as well as some opportunities that it brings to
defenders. Attackers can utilize AI to aid in social engineering
research and crafting spear phishing emails or craft deepfakes as well
as aid in developing malware. Defenders can incorporate AI Agents in
their threat hunting workflows.
