ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GITHUB PROJECTS TARGETED WITH MALICIOUS COMMITS TO FRAME RESEARCHER
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Alex Cheema of EXO Labs discovered a seemingly benign PR that
attempted to inject malware into EXO's GitHub repo. The PR attempted
to modify the models.py file with a set of Unicode characters that
translated to a code snippet that would download and run a file titled
stage1payload. The (now deleted) GitHub user that opened the PR was
named evildojo666, which suggested security researcher Mike Bell was
responsible. Bell has stated that this was an impersonator and that he
has no connection to the attempted backdoor. 

 SECURITY PLUGIN FLAW IN MILLIONS OF WORDPRESS SITES GIVES ADMIN
ACCESS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers from WordFence have discovered a new vulnerability in the
Really Simple Security WordPress plugin. The vulnerability involves an
error in handling an invalid login nonce in the 2FA procedure that can
allow an unauthenticated user to login as an administrator. Users
should ensure that they're on the latest version of the plugin.
WordFence is working with the plugin developers and WordPress.org to
force users to update to the latest version. The WordPress.org stats
site reported 3.5M sites that were potentially vulnerable at the time
of publication. 

 APPLE FIXES TWO ZERO-DAYS USED IN ATTACKS ON INTEL-BASED MACS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Apple released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day
vulnerabilities that were being exploited in attacks on Intel-based
Mac systems. The flaws allowed attackers to execute code remotely and
launch cross-site scripting attacks. Apple has addressed these
vulnerabilities in macOS Sequoia and other Apple operating systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ADDING THREAT DETECTION TO CUSTOM AUTHENTICATION FLOW WITH AMAZON
COGNITO ADVANCED SECURITY FEATURES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon Cognito is a user management offering from AWS that can
include security features such as threat detection. Cognito can use
custom authentication flows to support passwordless authentication
methods. It now supports using advanced security features on custom
authentication flows. This post walks through how to set up
passwordless authentication using webauthn and enable and configure
threat detection. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING IOS 18 INACTIVITY REBOOT (11 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article reverse engineers iOS 18's new inactivity reboot
security feature by analyzing both debug strings in the SEPKeyStore
kernel extension and decrypted Secure Enclave Processor (SEP)
firmware. The SEP tracks device unlock times and triggers a forced
reboot after 72 hours of inactivity. The feature is not
wireless-dependent as previously rumored, but rather is implemented
through direct SEP-to-kernel communication that forces devices into a
secure "Before First Unlock" state. The SEP's involvement makes this
feature highly tamper-resistant, requiring kernel-level code execution
within the first three days to prevent the reboot, effectively
creating an asymmetric defense that particularly impacts criminals
while leaving law enforcement a narrow window for forensic analysis. 

 UNVEILING SHARP PANDA'S NEW LOADER (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sharp Panda's new loader, now renamed Sharp Dragon, is deploying a
new dropper to target Southeast Asia countries. The malware disguises
itself as a Word document to trick victims and drops a malicious DLL
for further exploitation. The malware may contain keylogging features
and uses various APIs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 NUKE IT FROM ORBIT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Nuke It From Orbit (nifo) can disable AV/EDR products from Windows
machines even if they have BitLocker enabled if an attacker has
physical access. 

 KUBEHOUND (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 A Kubernetes attack graph tool that automatically calculates attack
paths between assets in a cluster. 

 GOCRACK (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 GoCrack is a management frontend that provides APIs for managing
password cracking tasks.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOOGLE MAY SOON LET YOU CREATE EMAIL ALIASES IN AN EFFORT TO FIGHT
SPAM (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Google Play Services' newest APK seems to include references to a
Shielded Email feature. This feature would allow users to create email
aliases when signing up for websites that can be turned off to avoid
spam. The feature is available in the Autofill settings but it doesn't
seem to be enabled at present. 

 ONE YEAR OF USING LLMS FOR APPLICATION SECURITY: WHAT WE LEARNED (5
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 LLMs show promise for finding vulnerabilities due to their potential
to understand code behaviors and go beyond the exact pattern matching
that is used in traditional SAST tools. LLMs provide inconsistent
results, have privacy issues, are time-intensive to train, and their
use can lead to vendor lock-in. Many of these issues could be
mitigated by modifying their usage. This article lists some possible
improvements. CodeLlama, LLaMA, Mixtral, and Mistral are particularly
problematic for these tasks. 

 CISA'S JACK CABLE ON SECURE-BY-DESIGN PLEDGE PROGRESS — AND NEXT
STEPS (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 There has been positive progress on the secure-by-design pledge,
which was launched in May and has now been signed by 248 companies who
committed to implementing seven key digital security practices within
a year of signing. The pledge focuses on improvements like expanding
multi-factor authentication, reducing default passwords, and better
vulnerability disclosure. Companies like Microsoft and Google are
already showing significant progress through monthly technical
exchanges and public reporting. While CISA plans to partner with a
civil society organization to independently assess companies' progress
and launch a website tracking their commitments, it won't remove
companies who fail to meet goals - it will instead let their lack of
progress be evident through an absence of public updates.
