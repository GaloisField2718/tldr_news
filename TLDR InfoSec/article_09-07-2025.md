 ENDPOINT SECURITY FOR 2025 WAYS OF WORKING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional VPNs create a single point of failure that gives threat
actors access to your entire network. ThreatLocker Network Control [4]
takes a different approach with direct client-to-server connections.

Unlike static firewall rules that require IT intervention for every
change, Network Control uses dynamic ACLs to automatically open ports
on-demand for authorized devices — and automatically close ports
within 5 minutes of non-usage.

With Network Control, you have complete control of network traffic -
regardless of where workers connect from. Create custom policies to
grant access based on IP address, keywords, or agent authentication.

See a short video demo [4] or schedule a full walkthrough of the
ThreatLocker platform [4].

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BALLAD: THIRD PARTY VENDOR EXPERIENCED DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Ballad Health issued a notice that its electronic print and mailing
provider, Renkim, detected suspicious data on its networks. Renkim
believes that data, which includes full names, contact information,
client name, client account number, dates of service, and in some
cases, Social Security Numbers, may have been stolen. 

 MASSIVE BROWSER HIJACKING CAMPAIGN INFECTS 2.3M CHROME, EDGE USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A popular Chrome color picker extension with 100,000+ downloads and
Google's verified badge secretly hijacks browsers, tracks user
activity, and creates backdoors. It's part of "RedDirection," a
campaign involving 18 malicious extensions that infected 2.3 million
users. 

 ANATSA ANDROID BANKING TROJAN HITS 90,000 USERS WITH FAKE PDF APP ON
GOOGLE PLAY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Anatsa banking malware targeted North American users through a
malicious "Document Viewer" app on the Google Play Store that was
downloaded 90,000 times. The Trojan, disguised as a PDF, updates
displays with fake maintenance notices during banking app access while
stealing credentials through overlays and keylogging.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SUPABASE MCP CAN LEAK YOUR ENTIRE SQL DATABASE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Attackers can exploit Supabase's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to leak
SQL databases by embedding malicious commands in support messages.
Developers using AI assistants like Cursor to review tickets can
unintentionally execute SQL queries with elevated privileges,
bypassing security. LLMs can't distinguish between user data and
instructions, enabling crafted messages to trigger unauthorized
database access and data exfiltration through the support interface. 

 ADVANCING PROTECTION IN CHROME ON ANDROID (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google's Android Advanced Protection now integrates with Chrome to
enhance security for high-risk users, such as journalists and
officials. It provides three key features: enforcing HTTPS everywhere,
full site isolation on devices with 4GB+ RAM to prevent data leaks,
and disabling JavaScript optimizations that are often exploited in V8
security bugs. These options, which have performance trade-offs, can
be enabled by enterprises and users through Chrome's privacy settings
and policies outside of Advanced Protection. 

 LEAN AND MEAN: HOW WE FINE-TUNED A MODEL FOR SECRET DETECTION IN CODE
(9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Wiz developed a small language model based on Llama 3.2 1B to detect
secrets in code. It utilized Claude Sonnet 3.7 to create a training
dataset of secrets based on scans of public GitHub repositories. It
then fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and
quantization, achieving an 82% recall rate and an 85% precision rate
on commercial CPUs.

longer used. With Pastoralist, you only need to run a simple command
to keep your project's dependencies clean and up-to-date. 

 CURSOR SECURITY RULES (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A repository with Cursor Security Rules that improve security in
development workflows and AI agent interactions by enforcing safe
coding practices, limiting sensitive operations, and reducing risks in
AI-assisted software development.

 OPENAI TIGHTENS THE SCREWS ON SECURITY TO KEEP AWAY PRYING EYES (1
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OpenAI has implemented stricter security measures to prevent
information leaks and poaching. The new measures include
“information tenting” policies that limit access to sensitive
algorithms and new products, isolating proprietary technology in
offline computers, implementing biometric access controls for office
areas, and a “deny-by-default” internet policy where explicit
approval is required for external connections. OpenAI reportedly also
increased physical security at data centers and expanded its
cybersecurity personnel. 

 SATANLOCK RANSOMWARE ENDS OPERATIONS, SAYS STOLEN DATA WILL BE LEAKED
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The SatanLock ransomware group, which was first identified in early
April, has announced that it will shut down and leak all stolen data.
In a report by Check Point in May, it was highlighted that more than
65% of SatanLock's victims had already appeared on leak sites run by
other ransomware groups, suggesting that the group might be attempting
to “reclaim” already compromised networks. SatanLock did not
provide any reason for its sudden closure but has removed all victim
listings from its .onion site. 

 HACKERS ABUSE LEAKED SHELLTER RED TEAM TOOL TO DEPLOY INFOSTEALERS (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Shellter, a commercial AV/EDR evasion loader for penetration testing,
confirmed that hackers were using its Shellter Elite product in
attacks after a customer leaked a copy of the software. Shellter has
stated that it released updates that would not reach the “malicious
customer” to combat the misuse. The leaked copy was first discovered
by Elastic Security Labs, who discovered that multiple threat actors
had been abusing Shellter Elite v11.0 to deploy infostealers.
