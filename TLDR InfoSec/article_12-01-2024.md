READ) [14] 

 Akamai uncovered a new crypto mining campaign active in 2023
spreading via SSH using a custom Mirai botnet called NoaBot. NoaBot
has wormable self-spreading capabilities and an SSH key backdoor. It
drops a modified XMRig miner with an obfuscated config and custom
mining pool. Evidence links it to 2023's P2PInfect worm, but immature
names complicate attribution.

with it.
