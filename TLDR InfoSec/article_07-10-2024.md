ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 WORDPRESS LITESPEED CACHE PLUGIN FLAW COULD ALLOW SITE TAKEOVER (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A serious flaw in the WordPress LiteSpeed Cache plugin affecting
versions up to 6.5.0.2 could allow attackers to run harmful code. The
vulnerability allows for arbitrary script injection when certain
settings are enabled, potentially leading to account hijacking and
site takeover. The issue was fixed in version 6.5.1, but site admins
should act quickly to secure their websites. 

 ALERT: OVER 700,000 DRAYTEK ROUTERS EXPOSED TO HACKING VIA 14 NEW
VULNERABILITIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers discovered 14 security vulnerabilities, dubbed
DRAY:BREAK, in DrayTek routers used in homes and businesses. These
flaws could allow attackers to take control of affected devices,
potentially gaining access to enterprise networks. The vulnerabilities
range in severity, with two rated critical, including one with the
highest possible CVSS score of 10.0.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TO CATCH A PREDATOR ADMIN: THE POWER OF OSINT (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post describes an investigation using OSINT tools that
uncovered a disturbing online CSAM marketplace run by 'JoeHaze'.
Despite challenges with law enforcement response, efforts were made to
gather evidence and report the predator to authorities for further
action. The importance of protecting children from online predators
was emphasized throughout the investigation. 

 SAFE RIDE INTO THE DANGERZONE: REDUCING ATTACK SURFACE WITH GVISOR (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Dangerzone is a software that sanitizes potentially risky documents
by detonating them in a container, creating a pixel map of the
document, then converting that image back to a document. Prior to
version 0.7.0, Dangerzone relied on Linux containers that are hardened
via removing process and network capabilities, minimal user ID
mapping, and syscall filtering via seccomp. To address gaps in its
security posture, Dangerzone integrated with gVisor, which is an
application kernel that has minimal privileges. To enable
multiplatform support, Dangerzone implemented a nested container
strategy where the outer container runs as a compatibility layer and
the inner layer runs the gVisor and Dangerzone logic. 

 PRIORITIZING DETECTION ENGINEERING (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Detection Engineering is a concept that emphasizes the importance of
managing the workload and complexity of a detection stack.
Prioritizing detection projects involves focusing on foundational
steps, collaborating on high-quality detections, and managing the work
involved in detection engineering. By intentionally addressing
operational management challenges and avoiding premature staffing, a
successful detection program can be developed with thoughtful planning
and strategic implementation.

 RYANAIR FLIGHT BOOKING PRACTICES CATCH EYE OF EU PRIVACY WATCHDOG (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ireland's Data Protection Commission launched an inquiry into
Ryanair's customer verification process, focusing on its use of facial

 MANUFACTURERS RANK AS RANSOMWARE'S BIGGEST TARGET (3 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The manufacturing industry has become the top target for ransomware
attacks, accounting for 21% of incidents. A study by Black Kite
reveals that 80% of manufacturing companies have critical
vulnerabilities, with 67% listed in CISA's Known Exploited

 WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT WIZ CODE? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This post contextualizes Wiz's new AppSec offerings via Wiz Code
within Wiz's product line and the CNAPP and ASPM industries. Wiz Code
offers SCA, secrets scanning, and IaC scanning, which largely already
existed via the WizCLI, but with Code the UX is tied together more
succinctly and scanning can be done via a GitHub integration
(pipelineless). Wiz Code is a nice add on for Wiz customers and shows
promise for the CNAPP space but lags behind full ASPM providers or
industry leading AppSec products.
