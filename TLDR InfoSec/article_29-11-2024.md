ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 THE SOURCE CODE OF BANSHEE STEALER LEAKED ONLINE (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Banshee Stealer, a macOS malware-as-a-service targeting browsers and
crypto wallets, shut down after its source code leaked online.
Developed by Russian hackers in August 2024, the malware's
GitHub-published code may increase macOS cybersecurity threats.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RESEARCHERS DISCOVER FIRST UEFI BOOTKIT MALWARE FOR LINUX (5 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Researchers at ESET discovered the first-ever UEFI bootkit (titled
Bootkitty) targeting Linux devices when it was uploaded to VirusTotal.
Bootkitty hooks UEFI security authentication protocols. It then hooks
various GRUB functions to turn off kernel signature verification and
intercepts the Linux kernel's decompression process to allow for
loading malicious kernel modules. Bootkitty replaces the first
environment variable to always load the malicious library at process
startup. The bootkit relies on self-signed certificates, specific
byte-pattern matching, and hardcoded offsets, so it will only work on
specific GRUB and kernel versions. It is still likely in development. 

 GITFLOPS: THE DANGERS OF TERRAFORM AUTOMATION PLATFORMS (12 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Terraform automation platforms like Atlantis and Terraform Cloud are
very popular for creating pull-request based CI/CD workflows. The
typical workflow involves opening a pull-request that will trigger a
read-only terraform plan which will then be reviewed and can be
applied by a more privileged user with a comment. A malicious user can
either inject code via the entry point of a malicious provider or
through a malicious data source to bypass the read-only protections of
terraform plan. This vulnerability has been confirmed on five
Terraform automation platforms.
