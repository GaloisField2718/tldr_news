 CISCO FIXES MAXIMUM-SEVERITY FLAW IN ENTERPRISE UNIFIED COMMS
PLATFORM (CVE-2025-20309) (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cisco discovered CVE-2025-20309, a backdoor vulnerability, in its
Unified Communications Manager with unchangeable default root
credentials. It affects only Engineering Special releases
(15.0.1.13010-1 through 15.0.1.13017-1), allowing remote attackers
root access. The vulnerability was found during internal testing with
no known exploitation. 

 GRAFANA RELEASES CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE FOR IMAGE RENDERER PLUGIN
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Grafana Labs has issued security updates for its Image Renderer
plugin and Synthetic Monitoring Agent to fix four high-severity
Chromium vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-5959, CVE-2025-6554, CVE-2025-6191,
and CVE-2025-6192). These flaws could allow remote code execution,
memory access, and heap corruption via crafted HTML pages. Affected
versions are those prior to 3.12.9 for Image Renderer and 0.38.3 for
Monitoring Agent, both of which include a headless Chromium browser
for dashboard rendering. Users should update immediately. Cloud and
Azure instances have already been patched.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OUTSOURCED TRUST: HOW COINBASE'S $400M PROBLEM STARTED IN AN INDIAN
CALL CENTER (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Coinbase suffered a data breach that affected 69,461 users when
outsourced call center employees illegally accessed customer
information. The attackers demanded a $20 million ransom, but Coinbase
offered a $20 million bounty instead. The breach enabled social
engineering scams, resulting in losses exceeding $ 65.7 million. 

 GUEST POST: HOW I SCANNED ALL OF GITHUB'S “OOPS COMMITS” FOR
LEAKED SECRETS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher discovered that GitHub permanently stores
"deleted" commits from force pushes as "zero-commit" PushEvents in the
GitHub Archive, making supposedly removed secrets still accessible via
commit hashes. By scanning all zero-commit force push events since
2020 using the GitHub Event API and GitHub Archive data, the
researcher built automated tools to identify and analyze these hidden
commits for leaked credentials, uncovering $ 25,000 worth of active
secrets. Key security strategies include implementing pre-commit
secret scanning, treating any committed secret as permanently
compromised regardless of deletion attempts, immediately revoking
exposed credentials, and protecting .env files, which were the most
common source of leaked secrets. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING CURSOR'S LLM CLIENT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 In this post, the authors used TensorZero, an open-source framework
for optimizing LLM applications with downstream feedback signals, to
observe the API calls and tokens sent between Cursor and the LLM
providers. They first ran into errors connecting to TensorZero running
locally because Cursor first sends a request to Cursor's servers for
additional processing, so the authors needed to set up a reverse proxy
to expose a public endpoint that would forward requests back to the
local machine. They then had to solve for CORS issues. Eventually,
they managed to wire Cursor up properly and included sample system
prompts and interactions between a user session and what Cursor
generates.

 RANSOMWARE GANG HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL SAYS IT'S SHUTTING DOWN (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The Hunters International ransomware gang announced its shutdown on
Thursday, offering free decryption keys to its victims. The group
operated for two years, targeting organizations including a U.S.
cancer center. Security experts suspect that this may be a rebranding
effort, with the gang potentially transitioning to "World Leaks" to
evade detection by law enforcement. 

 UNCOVERING NYTHEON AI - A NEW PLATFORM OF UNCENSORED LLMS (7 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Threat researchers at Cato CTRL have released a report on an
uncensored LLM platform known as Nytheon AI. The operators behind
Nytheon trained a suite of gen AI tools by employing jailbreaks on
open-source models from Meta and Deepseek. The Nytheon AI suite
includes models for code generation, document summarization and
translation, OCR, and a control model. 

 AWS CERTIFICATE MANAGER HAS ANNOUNCED EXPORTABLE TLS CERTIFICATES,
AND I'M MOSTLY OKAY WITH IT (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Recently, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) added the ability to export
certificates and private keys for use in EC2 or external applications.
Currently, ACM does not implement ACME, so certificate renewals must
be handled manually or via the AWS API. Organizations that want to
ensure that private keys never leave ACM can disable exports at the
AWS Organization level or on an account-by-account basis via SCPs.
