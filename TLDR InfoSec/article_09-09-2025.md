ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM WEALTHSIMPLE DISCLOSES DATA BREACH (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Canadian financial services firm Wealthsimple disclosed a data breach
detected on August 30 that exposed the personal information of fewer
than 30,000 customers (less than 1% of its 3 million client base)
through a compromised third-party software package. The stolen data
included contact details, government IDs, financial account numbers,
Social Insurance Numbers, IP addresses, and dates of birth. No
passwords or customer funds were compromised. Wealthsimple is
providing affected customers with two years of free credit monitoring,
dark-web monitoring, identity theft protection, and insurance. It
confirmed the incident was unrelated to recent Salesforce breaches. 

 GHOSTACTION ATTACK STEALS 3,325 SECRETS FROM GITHUB PROJECTS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The GhostAction supply chain attack compromised 817 GitHub
repositories by injecting malicious workflow files that appeared to be
routine automation scripts but actually exfiltrated CI/CD secrets to
an external server. The campaign affected 327 developers across
multiple programming languages, stealing 3,325 secrets, including npm,
PyPI, DockerHub tokens, and AWS credentials that could enable further
attacks on software supply chains. The attackers personalized each
commit and analyzed legitimate workflows to identify which secrets to
target. At least 24 projects (9 npm and 15 PyPI) remain at risk from
compromised tokens despite no confirmed malicious package releases
yet. 

 OVER 6,700 PRIVATE REPOSITORIES MADE PUBLIC IN NX SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK
(4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hackers used stolen secrets from Nx to expose over 6,700 private
repositories in a major supply chain attack that targeted hundreds of
organizations. The threat actors leveraged malicious Nx packages to
steal API keys and credentials, and exploited the compromised accounts
to publish sensitive data from private repositories to public GitHub
repositories.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GPUGATE MALWARE: MALICIOUS GITHUB DESKTOP IMPLANTS USE
HARDWARE-SPECIFIC DECRYPTION, ABUSE GOOGLE ADS TO TARGET WESTERN
EUROPE (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Russian-speaking threat actors deployed the "GPUGate" campaign using
a sophisticated multi-stage attack combining Google Ads malvertising,
GitHub commit manipulation, and hardware-specific GPU-gated decryption
to target Western European IT professionals with fake GitHub Desktop
installers. The attackers leveraged Google's paid search results,
modified legitimate GitHub repository commits to include malicious
download links, and created 128MB installers with OpenCL-based
decryption that only executes on systems with real GPUs (device names
>10 characters), effectively bypassing sandbox analysis. The campaign
demonstrates advanced evasion tactics, including UAC bypass, Windows
Defender exclusions, persistence through scheduled tasks, and modular
payload delivery, with the ultimate goal of credential theft, lateral
movement, and potential ransomware deployment targeting high-value IT
sector victims. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING OF APPLE'S IOS 0-CLICK CVE-2025-43300: 2 BYTES
THAT MAKE SIZE MATTER (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CVE-2025-43300 is a zero-click out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
the ImageIO framework that occurs when processing DNG images with JPEG
lossless compression. Exploited in the wild, the vulnerability stems
from incorrect buffer allocation and loop bounds in the lossless JPEG
decompression code, where the system assumes at least two components
per pixel but processes images with only 1 component, causing writes
beyond allocated memory. Apple's patch adds bounds checking to verify
buffer size before each write operation and raises an exception when
the buffer would be exceeded, fixing the mismatch between allocated
buffer size (based on components per pixel) and actual write
operations. 

 ESCAPING THE CONFINES OF PORT 445 (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers are restricted to using port 445 when performing NTLM relay
attacks on SMB in Active Directory environments. A common strategy to
get around this limitation is by extracting the SAM and SYSTEM
registry hives to dump NT hashes, but this often triggers alerts or is
blocked by EDR. This article details a technique that uses Service
Control Manager (SCM) to start the Webclient service, which offers
more lateral movement options.

 DITTOBYTES (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Dittobytes compiles C-code into truly Position Independent Code (PIC)
for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Supporting AMD64 and ARM64, it has a
metamorphic engine that ensures each compile produces unique,
functional shellcode. The resulting shellcode is very small and simple
and has minimal overhead. 

 FIRECOMPASS (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 FireCompass is a platform that integrates attack surface management,
continuous threat exposure management, network and application
penetration testing, penetration testing as a service, and red
teaming. 

 FINDMYTAKEOVER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 findmytakeover is a tool that detects dangling DNS records in a
multi-cloud environment. It achieves this by scanning all DNS zones
and infrastructure within the configured cloud service provider,
whether in a single or multiple accounts, to identify DNS records for
which the underlying infrastructure no longer exists, rather than
relying on a wordlist.

 GERMANY CHARGES HACKER WITH ROSNEFT CYBERATTACK IN LATEST WAKE-UP
CALL FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 German prosecutors charged a 30-year-old man with computer sabotage,
data alteration, and espionage for attacking Rosneft Deutschland in
March 2022, stealing and deleting 20 terabytes of data while leaving a
"Glory to Ukraine" message, costing the company €12.36 million in
damages. The attack, conducted in the aftermath of Russia's invasion
of Ukraine, exposed sensitive internal communications and corporate
documents, with the stolen data later distributed by the Anonymous
hacktivist collective. The incident highlights the vulnerability of
critical energy infrastructure to cyberattacks, particularly during
geopolitical tensions, emphasizing the need for enhanced cybersecurity
measures in essential services sectors. 

 SEXTORTION WITH A TWIST: SPYWARE TAKES WEBCAM PICS OF USERS WATCHING
PORN (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new variant of spyware called Stealerium can automatically take
webcam photos of people while they watch porn, then send these to
hackers for possible blackmail. Distributed as free, open-source code,
it infects users via phishing emails. Researchers say this marks a
move from large-scale ransom to more personal extortion, and warn it's
hard to track individual victims. 

 THE CRAZY, TRUE STORY BEHIND THE FIRST AI-POWERED RANSOMWARE (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 NYU researchers built an AI-powered ransomware as a proof-of-concept,
showing how large language models can automate targeted ransomware
attacks. Their project, initially intended for research purposes, was
flagged by security experts as a real threat after it was uploaded to
VirusTotal. The experiment highlights growing concerns that, soon,
cybercriminals will be able to easily weaponize AI for sophisticated,
undetectable attacks.
