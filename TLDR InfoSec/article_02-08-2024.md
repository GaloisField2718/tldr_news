 EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT SOC 2 IS WRONG. HOW YOU CAN ACHIEVE
MORE BY DOING LESS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Many companies think of compliance in terms of templates and generic
checklists. These box-ticking exercises are high-effort, slow, and can
cause teams to take compliance and security less seriously (or treat
it as a nuisance).

So before you tackle that 80+ item checklist, or ask employees to
review 20-page policy documents, ask yourself: Are there ways to
reduce scope [4] ‚Äî without actually hurting compliance?

Here are some resources to get you started:

 	* Read this guide by Assurance Lab [4] on the art of doing less
 	* Find out why everything you know about SOC 2 is most likely wrong
[5]
 	* Streamline your compliance with AI-powered audits [6]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DIGICERT REVOKES 83K TLS CERTIFICATES DUE TO DOMAIN VALIDATION BUG (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 DigiCert announced that it will be revoking 0.4% of certificates
issued from August 2019 to June 2024. The CABF baseline domain
verification requirement is to publish a CNAME record with the domain
followed by an underscore and random value. A bug introduced in August
2019 led to some code paths not appending the underscore which could
potentially lead to clashes between the record and subdomains.
DigiCert says this is unlikely due to the random value having 150 bits
of entropy, but nevertheless has notified customers that it will be
revoking affected certificates. 

 CISA: CRITICAL SERVICENOW VULNERABILITIES BEING TARGETED BY HACKERS
(3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CISA and several security companies are warning that two ServiceNow
vulnerabilities that were reported by AssetNote on July 11 are being
actively exploited. The vulnerabilities allow attackers to access
databases and exfiltrate data as well as read arbitrary files.
Researchers warn of between 13k to 42k vulnerable ServiceNow instances
ranging across the private and public sectors. 

 'ERROR' IN MICROSOFT'S DDOS DEFENSES AMPLIFIED 8-HOUR AZURE OUTAGE (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft admitted its defensive implementation worsened the Azure
outage on July 30, which was initially triggered by a DDoS attack.
DDOS attacks aim to overwhelm systems with malicious traffic. They are
becoming increasingly common, so Microsoft should have been able to
prevent the outage.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REVEALING THE INNER STRUCTURE OF AWS SESSION TOKENS (17 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Tal Be'ery, co-founder of ZenGo, performed a first ever analysis of
AWS Session Tokens to uncover the components that make up a session
token. The goal of this research was to discover if the tokens
contained sensitive information and if tokens could be edited for
forgery as well as other attack vectors. The research found that
session tokens are base64 encoded protobufs that store most of the
interesting information in a userEncryptedData field. The researchers
found that they could forge tokens however AWS rejected forged tokens.
The post includes more details about the reversing process and
protobuf fields. 

 SECURING YOUR SECRETS IN AWS (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 An exploration of how to incrementally improve credentials access in
AWS. The post begins with outlining a ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù credentials
workflow before detailing how environment variables do not solve the
threats inherent with having plaintext credentials. It then outlines
how to store secrets in Secrets Manager and have the application
dynamically retrieve them to eliminate plaintext secrets from
production. The next improvement comes from using KMS to encrypt
secrets before using them in CI/CD pipelines to reduce the presence of
plaintext credentials. The post then details steps that service
providers can use to improve credential management for customers
including bringing your own key. 

 CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM IMPLANT (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post discusses creating a custom implant for evasive
purposes by avoiding detection through customized payloads. It
explains the process of building the implant in C and includes details
on server setup, interactive features, client functionality, and
testing against security tools. The conclusion highlights the
advantages of custom implants but also emphasizes the need for caution
due to potential limitations and security considerations.

 OVER 1 MILLION DOMAINS AT RISK OF 'SITTING DUCKS' DOMAIN HIJACKING
TECHNIQUE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A joint analysis by Infoblox and Eclypsium reveals that Russian

attacks to hijack domains without accessing owner accounts. This
method, easier and less detectable than other hijacking techniques,
has affected over 35,000 domains since 2018.
