ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SUSPECTED INFOSTEALER MALWARE DATA BREACH EXPOSED 184M LOGINS AND
PASSWORDS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered a publicly exposed
database that was unencrypted and not password protected, which
included over 184M unique logins and passwords. The database contained
legitimate credentials for various services such as email providers,
Microsoft products, social media accounts, and financial accounts.
Fowler contacted the hosting provider, and the database has since been
removed. 

 DOZENS OF MALICIOUS PACKAGES ON NPM COLLECT HOST AND NETWORK DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Socket's threat research team discovered 60 packages on NPM that
collect sensitive information about a device and send it to Discord.
The malicious packages contain a post-install script that collects
hostnames, internal IPs, user home directories, current working
directories, usernames, and system DNS servers. Socket did not detect
any additional payloads, but reported the packages for removal. 

 RESEARCHERS DROP POC FOR FORTINET CVE-2025-32756, URGING QUICK
PATCHING (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A serious security flaw, CVE-2025-32756, is being used by hackers to
attack Fortinet products like FortiMail and FortiCamera. This bug lets
attackers run harmful code without logging in by tricking the system
with special data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO AUTOMATE INCIDENT RESPONSE FOR AMAZON EKS ON AMAZON EC2 (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This AWS blog post explains how to automate incident response for
Amazon EKS clusters, highlighting key differences from EC2 response
procedures. It covers EKS-specific challenges like pod-to-process
mapping, network isolation using cordoning and network policies, and
presents a customized automated forensics solution that handles
acquisition, isolation, investigation, and reporting for EKS security
events. 

 HUMANS ARE INSECURE PASSWORD GENERATORS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Neural networks can crack human-chosen passwords by learning from
password distributions, making traditional "strong" passwords
vulnerable. The solution: abandon human-chosen passwords entirely and
use password managers with randomly generated passwords to maintain
security. 

 LEVERAGING SYSMON TO COMPLEMENT EDR AND ADDRESS EVASION TECHNIQUES (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers can bypass EDR solutions using techniques such as kernel
hooking, syscall injections, DLL unhooking, process hollowing, and APC
injection to evade detection. Sysmon event IDs 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12
detect these evasion methods by monitoring process creation, DLL
loads, thread injection, memory access, file creation, and registry
modifications. Combining Sysmon with traditional EDR forms a layered
defense, capturing endpoint activities that standard EDRs miss,
particularly low-level memory manipulation and kernel-level
operations.

 TELEMESSAGE EXPLORER: A NEW OPEN SOURCE RESEARCH TOOL (9 MINUTE READ)
[13] 

 Micah Lee, a journalist, developed and shared an open-source tool
named TeleMessage Explorer to assist journalists in examining leaked
data from TeleMessage. This tool processes and visualizes messages,
users, and attachments from the compromised dataset. Journalists
require special access to the dataset to utilize the tool and reveal
significant insights.

 BANKS WANT SEC TO RESCIND CYBERATTACK DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 American banking groups, led by the ABA, want the SEC to revoke
cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements, arguing they conflict
with confidential reporting and hinder law enforcement efforts. The
groups claim the July 2023 rule creates market confusion and
interferes with incident response. 

 BREAKING RSA ENCRYPTION JUST GOT 20X EASIER FOR QUANTUM COMPUTERS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 New research from Google Quantum AI indicates that RSA-2048
encryption can be cracked by a quantum computer with one million
qubits in one week, needing 20 times fewer qubits than Google's 2019
estimate due to algorithmic improvements. This advancement shortens
the timeline for when the current RSA encryption schemes become
vulnerable, with experts predicting that quantum computers will break
asymmetric cryptography by 2029. Organizations must accelerate
post-quantum cryptography adoption immediately, as the multi-year
migration timeline means preparation cannot wait, even if quantum
attacks are still years away. 

 OPEN MPIC PROJECT DEFENDS AGAINST BGP ATTACKS ON CERTIFICATE
VALIDATION (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Open MPIC is an open-source tool that helps stop BGP hijacking
attacks during website certificate checks. It works by checking domain
ownership from many places around the world instead of just one. This
makes it harder for attackers to trick systems and helps keep internet
traffic secure.
