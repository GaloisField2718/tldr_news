 SUBLIME SECURITY 2026 EMAIL THREAT RESEARCH REPORT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Email threats evolved quickly in 2025, and security teams felt the
impact. Sublime Security's 2026 EMAIL THREAT RESEARCH REPORT [4]
analyzes real-world email attacks across organizations of all sizes to
reveal what actually changed and why it matters.

Inside the report:

• Thread hijacking now appears in over 28% of BEC attacks

• Malicious QR codes increased 280% in the second half of 2025

• ICS phishing, email bombs, and service abuse continue to rise

The report also examines evasion techniques and offers practical
guidance for defending email in 2026.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PALO ALTO NETWORKS PATCHES FIREWALLS AFTER DISCOVERY OF A NEW
DENIAL-OF-SERVICE FLAW (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Palo Alto Networks has patched CVE-2026-0227 (CVSS 7.7), a
high-severity DoS vulnerability in PAN-OS affecting firewalls with
GlobalProtect gateway or portal enabled that allows unauthenticated
attackers to force devices into maintenance mode. A PoC already
exists, and the flaw mirrors CVE-2024-3393 from late 2024, which was
exploited as a zero-day before patches were available. Organizations
running PAN-OS versions 10.2 through 12.1 with GlobalProtect enabled
should apply patches immediately, while most Prisma Access customers
have already been automatically updated. 

 SYNOLOGY DSM 7.3.2 (10 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A local privilege escalation vulnerability chain in Synology DSM
7.3.2-86009 allows any authenticated user with shell access to gain
root when DownloadStation with BitTorrent is enabled. The exploit
chains three misconfigurations: a world-writable Transmission RPC
socket running as root, a world-writable /volume1/@eaDir/ system
directory, and a missing nosuid mount flag on /volume1, enabling
attackers to configure Transmission's script-torrent-done-filename to
execute arbitrary payloads as root upon torrent completion. A full PoC
is available, and the vulnerability has been reported to Synology
PSIRT. 

 KONNI HACKERS TARGET BLOCKCHAIN ENGINEERS WITH AI-BUILT MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from CheckPoint have discovered a new malicious campaign
from the North Korean Konni hackers. The attack begins with a Discord
link that downloads a zip archive containing a lure document and two
batch files which downloads a PowerShell backdoor and then deletes
other signs of infection. Notably, the malware contains signs of it
being AI-generated, such as comments with variable placeholders.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ORGANIZED TRAFFER GANG ON THE RISE TARGETING WEB3 EMPLOYEES AND
CRYPTO HOLDERS (18 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hybrid Analysis uncovered a sophisticated Russian-speaking Traffer
operation targeting cryptocurrency users and Web3 employees through
fake Electron applications disguised as AI productivity tools, meeting
software, and gaming platforms, with documented earnings of at least
$2.4 million. The campaign uses 80+ domains, elaborate fake company
ecosystems with purchased social media accounts, and abused
code-signing certificates to deliver second-stage payloads, with
shared infrastructure suggesting links to the Marko Polo, CrazyEvil,
and Wagmi Traffer groups. Security teams should monitor for the
provided IOCs and exercise caution with unsolicited software downloads
from Web3-themed applications, particularly those requiring invitation
codes or tokens for access. 

 EXPLOITING KEYSPACE REDUCTION AND RELAY ATTACKS IN 3DES AND
AES-PROTECTED NFC TECHNOLOGIES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Modern NFC cards used in hotel keys, tickets, and access systems can
be attacked not by breaking 3DES or AES, but by abusing how keys and
memory are handled after authentication. By relaying the legit
reader–card handshake and then partially overwriting key bytes,
attackers can shrink the effective keyspace from astronomically large
to something brute‑forceable with modest hardware. Weak or missing
integrity checks, non‑atomic key writes, and flawed non‑NXP clone
cards make it possible to recover full keys from one or a few tags,
sometimes in under a minute. Proper key diversification, locking key
pages, enabling CMAC/secure messaging, and migrating to stronger
platforms like DESFire EV3 sharply reduce these risks. 

 AMAZON CLOUDFRONT MTLS WITH OPEN-SOURCE SERVERLESS CA (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 AWS added support for CloudFront to use mTLS to require client
certificates in requests at re:Invent 2025. This article walks through
setting up CloudFront to use mTLS via an open-source serverless CA
that the author developed. AWS should offer a standardized Trust
Store, possibly in ACM, rather than having all services that support
mTLS implement it separately.

 149M LOGINS FROM ROBLOX, TIKTOK, NETFLIX, CRYPTO WALLETS FOUND ONLINE
(3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A security researcher discovered a 96GB database containing 149
million stolen credentials for services including Facebook (17M),
Netflix (3.4M), Binance (420K), Gmail (48M), and government domains
from multiple countries, exposed online without authentication. The
data appeared to be collected via infostealer malware through an
organized system with reversed labeling to sort by device and website.
The database was actively growing during the month it took to get the
hosting provider to take it offline. Users should enable MFA, use
unique passwords via password managers, and monitor for credential
exposure on services like Have I Been Pwned. 

 MALICIOUS VS CODE AI EXTENSIONS WITH 1.5 MILLION INSTALLS STEAL
DEVELOPER SOURCE CODE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Security firm Koi Security uncovered two popular AI-branded VS Code
extensions that quietly exfiltrate every opened and edited file to
China-based servers, while still functioning as legitimate coding
assistants. They also support remote-triggered bulk exfiltration of up
to 50 workspace files, fingerprint devices via embedded analytics
SDKs, and are linked to a broader “MaliciousCorgi” campaign
alongside new PackageGate flaws in JavaScript package managers that
weaken common supply chain defenses. 

 TIKTOK USERS FREAK OUT OVER APP'S “IMMIGRATION STATUS” COLLECTION
- HERE'S WHAT IT MEANS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 TikTok updated its privacy policy as part of its new ownership
agreement, which triggered user notifications. Many users noted
concerning amounts of sensitive data the app collects, such as precise
location data and immigration status. TikTok has noted that this
disclosure is required by laws such as California's CCPA.
