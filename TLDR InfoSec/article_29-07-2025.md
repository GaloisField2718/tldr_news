 FOUR QUESTIONS CISOS ARE ASKING ABOUT GENERATIVE AI IN 2025 (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Generative AI (GenAI) is one of the hottest topics in cybersecurity
yet there are still more questions than answers. SentinelOne has
gathered the top questions (and answers) about GenAI in SecOps [4]
from CISO's and security leaders such as: 

- What Impact is Generative AI Having on the Threat Landscape? 
- What are the Top Use Cases for Generative AI in Cybersecurity? 
- How can Organizations Evaluate Generative AI Offerings and Vendors? 
- What are the implications of GenAI for the future role of the SOC?

vulnerability in LG Innotek LNV5110R cameras that could allow remote
attackers to gain administrative privileges. The vulnerability allows

 A STANDARD FOR HUMAN-CENTERED INVESTIGATION PLAYBOOKS (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 The Human-Centered Playbook standard is a structured format for
documenting investigation workflows through questions that guide
analysts during the investigation. Playbooks are triggered by cues
such as an attack or a suspicious artifact and progress in a series of
questions that include context, log sources, and queries for the
analyst. Security Onion has adopted this standard. Sample playbooks
are available on the platform. 

 DISSECTING RDP ACTIVITY (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a common entry point for legitimate
users and attackers in Windows environments. This blog post lists out
event IDs and builds a timeline for an RDP session from logon to
session end. It also includes a sample timeline of events for an RDP
session. 

 ARCANUM'S AI SECURITY SCALING RUBRIC (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Arcanum uses a three-stage model for scaling AI in security teams. In
the first stage, AI functions as an assistant to augment teams for
single, narrowly scoped tasks. The second phase involves scaling the
AI to automate a complete workflow in a single domain using tools such
as agents and RAG. The third stage scales the AI tooling up to
automate workflows across the entire organization.

 DEBIAN ISN'T WAITING FOR 2038 TO BLOW UP, SWITCHES TO 64-BIT TIME FOR
EVERYTHING (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Debian will switch to 64-bit time on 32-bit architectures from Debian
13 "Trixie" to prevent the Y2K38 bug, where 32-bit signed integers
overflow on January 19, 2038. This affects 6,429 packages and breaks
ABI compatibility, but maintainers have fixed all affected libraries.
The legacy i386 port keeps 32-bit time for compatibility with existing
x86 binaries. 

 MICROSOFT UNCOVERS MACOS FLAW ALLOWING BYPASS TCC PROTECTIONS AND
EXPOSING SENSITIVE DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Microsoft discovered CVE-2025-31199, a macOS vulnerability that
allows attackers to bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC)
protections by exploiting Spotlight's .mdimporter plugins to access
sensitive data without user permission. The flaw enables access to
protected directories, such as Downloads and Apple Intelligence cache
files, which contain GPS locations, face recognition data, and device
metadata that sync across iCloud-linked devices. Apple patched the
vulnerability in macOS Sequoia 15.4 in March following the development
of a proof-of-concept tool by Microsoft called "Sploitlight" which
demonstrated the exploit.
