ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 THIS WINDOWS POWERSHELL PHISH HAS SCARY POTENTIAL (4 MINUTE READ) [5]


 This post reports on a new phishing campaign that is targeting GitHub
project maintainers with a phishing email that instructs them to click
through to a site to view a vulnerability report on their repository.
This site then prompts them to copy and paste a command that downloads
the Lumma Stealer malware into the Windows Run dialog. While many
technical people would likely not fall for this phish, the tactics
could be employed in non-technical contexts with more success. 

 GLOBAL INFOSTEALER MALWARE OPERATION TARGETS CRYPTO USERS, GAMERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Recorded Future's Insikt Group is tracking a massive infostealer
campaign with over 50 different variants. The campaign is targeting
high-value targets in the crypto and gaming communities by spear
phishing attacks impersonating job opportunities or collaborations to
distribute malware. It is very sophisticated and utilizes a variety of
different payloads depending on the OS of the target. 

 POLICE BROKE TOR ANONYMITY TO ARREST DARK WEB USERS IN MAJOR CSAM
BUST (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 German authorities dismantled a Dark Web platform for child sexual
abuse material in 2021 by identifying Tor users, raising concerns
about Tor's privacy. The platform, Boystown, had over 400,000 users
and hosted severe abuse content, leading to arrests and a significant
blow to illegal dark web activity. Experts suggest outdated software
and increased scrutiny of Tor nodes played a role, emphasizing the
need for users to enhance their browser security.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 METHODOLOGY FOR INCIDENT RESPONSE ON GENERATIVE AI WORKLOADS (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS' Incident Response team has released guidance for investigating
incidents on Generative AI workloads in AWS. The post begins by
discussing the steps that can be taken before an incident to train
users, set up logging, and create playbooks. It then details how to
investigate each component of a workload such as the infrastructure
changes, AI settings changes, access changes, private data changes,
and invocation logs. The post concludes with a sample scenario. 

 SCORECARDING SECURITY (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security teams should introduce security scorecards to scale security
beyond security champions or dedicated teams. They should also take
care to establish partnerships with teams, improve the UX of security
scorecards, go beyond vulnerability management, and allow room for
risk acceptance. This post presents several case studies of
organizations that have implemented and publicly discussed security
scorecards. 

 A JOURNEY FROM SUDO IPTABLES TO LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (11 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 This blog post demonstrates how a low-privileged user on a Linux
machine can gain root privileges by manipulating iptables and
iptables-save through sudo, potentially leading to local privilege
escalation. Leveraging sudo commands with NOPASSWD privileges or
combining sudo with tools like tcpdump can allow for executing
arbitrary commands as root. By exploiting the functionalities of
iptables and iptables-save, an attacker can craft a root entry in
/etc/passwd and escalate privileges to root on the system.

 REDEFINING SECURITY COVERAGE FOR PYTHON WITH FRAMEWORK NATIVE
ANALYSIS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SAST tools often struggle to detect vulnerabilities and follow
control flow across complex frameworks or libraries. To address this,
Semgrep Pro has added framework-aware analysis, global object
tracking, and prebuilt rules for Django, Flask, FastAPI, and other
major libraries. Semgrep's testing resulted in an 84% true positive
rate on ~1,000 findings across 192 repositories containing ~20M lines
of code. 

 THE CLOUD IS DARKER AND MORE FULL OF TERRORS (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Chris Farris, an expert on cloud security, writes a scathing
condemnation of the state of cloud security. Farris begins the post by
detailing many major cloud security incidents from Code Spaces to
CrowdStrike. He divides these incidents into those that were caused by
blatant customer failures such as not disabling access of terminated
employees, not storing backups, and not enabling security features,
and those incidents that were caused by blatant cloud provider
failures such as Snowflake not enforcing MFA. Farris argues that we
must demand more security guardrails and baseline features from cloud
providers. 

 AWS PRIVATE CA NOW SUPPORTS SCEP FOR MOBILE DEVICES (2 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 AWS Private CA has added SCEP support at no additional cost. SCEP is
a protocol that is adopted by MDM solutions to obtain digital
identities from a CA. This allows organizations that use an MDM
provider to utilize their cloud CA for SCEP instead of needing to
manage a separate CA for it.
