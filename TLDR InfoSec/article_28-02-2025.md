 MICROSOFT FACES 600M DAILY ATTACKS - HOW SECURE IS YOUR MICROSOFT
ENVIRONMENT? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Microsoft reports their customers face 600 million attacks daily from
cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Despite Microsoft 365 apps
sharing a common authentication layer, each app within the suite
presents unique security challenges. Analysis by Obsidian Security
reveals 70% of integrations are inactive, yet many retain privileged
access—a key vector in the Midnight Blizzard breach.

 Claude 3.7 Sonnet generated a CRUD application with notably secure
code but still with a potential denial-of-service vulnerability in the
email validation regex, which uses greedy quantifiers that could lead

outperformed previous models and competitors that generated code with
XSS vulnerabilities. 

 HOW DOES SENDBIRD SECURE AWS? (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Sendbird improved AWS security by utilizing a holistic cloud security
model, transitioning to SSO with Okta, managing access requests for

 MINIMAL LLM-BASED FUZZ HARNESS GENERATOR (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers from AdaLogics experimented with using their Fuzz
Introspector tool along with an LLM to generate fuzz testing
harnesses. The fuzzing workflow that they created takes a project link
and function name and uses Fuzz Inspector to extract the necessary
data for the LLM. This data is then converted into a prompt that is
sent to the LLM and then the LLM's output is extracted and manually
verified for correctness.
