ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DOCKER HUB STILL HOSTS DOZENS OF LINUX IMAGES WITH THE XZ BACKDOOR (5
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There are over 35 Docker Hub images that still contain the XZ-Utils
backdoor (CVE-2024-3094). Discovered in March 2024, the vulnerability
allows attackers with a specific private key to bypass SSH
authentication and execute commands as root. Debian has refused to
remove the backdoored images, citing low exploitation risk and
archival continuity, despite the danger of accidental pulls in CI/CD
pipelines. Organizations should verify that their containers use
XZ-Utils version 5.6.2 or later to avoid inheriting this supply chain
compromise. 

 NY BUSINESS COUNCIL DISCLOSES DATA BREACH AFFECTING 47K PEOPLE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Business Council of New York State (BCNYS), the largest employer
association in the state, revealed that attackers stole personal,
financial, and health data of over 47,000 people in a February breach.
The data included full names, SSNs, birth dates, IDs, financial info,
payment card details, and e-signatures. BCNYS said it didn't detect
the breach until August 4, but cut off access immediately. 

 CASINO TECH OUTFIT BRAGG COPS TO INTRUSION BUT SAYS DATA JACKPOT
UNTOUCHED (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bragg Gaming Group reported a cyberattack that affected only its
internal systems. No customer or personal data was accessed.
Operations continue normally, although key details about the attack
method and duration are still unclear, leaving some questions about
the incident's full impact.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANALYZING EVOLUTION OF THE PIPEMAGIC MALWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Kaspersky and BI.ZONE analyzed PipeMagic backdoor's evolution from
2022 to 2025, revealing new infections in Saudi Arabia and Brazil
using fake ChatGPT apps, exploiting CVE-2025-29824 for privilege
escalation. The malware now includes enhanced modules for asynchronous
communication, payload injection, and .NET execution, with attackers
using LSASS memory dumping for lateral movement across compromised
networks. 

 MALWARE ANALYSIS ON AWS: SETTING UP A SECURE ENVIRONMENT (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Malware analysis environments have complex requirements as they must
allow analysts to effectively analyze potentially malicious code while
it is executing in the environment. This post proposes a process in
which a security analyst gains access to an EC2 instance with no
outbound connectivity via AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. The
analyst then connects to malware samples through a gateway endpoint
for S3 to download the malware and detonate it, and then they can use
services such as CloudTrail and GuardDuty to monitor the behavior. The
post provides a detailed setup checklist that covers policy, account
setup, VPC design, instance configuration, storage, monitoring, IAM,
and lifecycle considerations. 

 NOODLOPHILE STEALER EVOLVES: TARGETED COPYRIGHT PHISHING HITS
ENTERPRISES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA FOOTPRINTS (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 The Noodlophile Stealer malware has evolved. It is now conducting
targeted phishing campaigns impersonating copyright claims, mainly
against organizations with large social media presences. The attackers
steal browser and login data, adapting tactics for better success, and
concentrate on enterprises with significant Facebook activity,
highlighting the need for stronger cybersecurity and anti-phishing
measures.

 OKTA OPEN-SOURCES CATALOG OF AUTH0 RULES FOR THREAT DETECTION (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Okta has open-sourced ready-made Sigma queries for Auth0 customers to
detect account takeovers, misconfigurations, and suspicious behavior
in event logs. Auth0 is an IAM platform used by organizations for

 AWS PRICING FOR KIRO DEV TOOL DUBBED 'A WALLET-WRECKING TRAGEDY' (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AWS changed Kiro's pricing from reasonable plans to a split request
model with "vibe" at $0.04 and "spec" at $0.20. Developers report
monthly costs of $550-$1,950, far above the promised 1,000
interactions for $19. The free tier offers only 50 vibe requests, with
no spec requests, requiring immediate payment for actual code
execution. Open-source developers use 4-6 requests per action, making
Kiro more expensive than AWS's Amazon Q ($40 for 3,000 requests) or
competitors with unlimited plans. 

 HOW XPROTECT'S DETECTION RULES HAVE CHANGED FROM 2019-2025 (4 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 XProtect comprises YARA detection rules employed by Gatekeeper checks
to identify known malware. Over six years, the number of rules has
quadrupled, and the total size has grown to 22 times its original.
This expansion results in longer scan times. However, removing older
rules is risky, as it could leave newer Macs vulnerable to malware,
especially if they still support x86 execution. 

 MOZILLA WARNS GERMANY COULD SOON DECLARE AD BLOCKERS ILLEGAL (2
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Mozilla has raised concerns about a recent ruling by Germany's
Federal Supreme Court (BGH) in a case brought by online media company
Axel Springer against Eyeo, the makers of the Adblock Plus browser
extension. Axel Springer claimed that a website's HTML/CSS is a
protected computer program, and therefore, ad blockers that interact
with in-memory structures such as DOM, CSSOM, and the rendering tree
should be considered unlawful reproduction and modification. The
lawsuit has significant implications for other types of browser
extensions that alter the DOM, as well as ad blockers.
