 LAST YEAR'S TOP 100 BREACHES ALL HAD ENDPOINT DETECTION. CLEARLY, WE
NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 🚨 The industry's average time before a breach is detected is 196
days. Modern threats slip past EDR, EPP, SIEM, and vulnerability
scanners by targeting configuration and system changes these tools
miss. 

CimTrak's System Integrity Assurance adds the missing layer to your
stack:

	* Instantly detect, rollback, and remediate unauthorized changes in
real-time
	* Cut breach detection time from 196 DAYS TO MINUTES [5] 
 	* Block tampering—even from admin-level accounts
 	* Rapidly identify Zero-Day Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats
 	* Maintain continuous, audit-ready compliance (PCI, SOC2, ISO 27001,
NIST CSF, & more)

MODERN THREATS DEMAND MODERN DEFENSES. SECURE WHAT OTHERS MISS.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AWS HONEY TOKENS: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (10 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 AWS honey tokens are AWS Access Keys strategically placed across a
system and used as a digital tripwire to determine when an attack has
breached the system. The Canarytokens project by Thinkst is an
open-source implementation that utilizes two Lambda functions to
create a honey token system that notifies users via CloudWatch of any
token usage. This project has two drawbacks: it uses an easily
identifiable naming scheme for generating tokens, and it only appends
a timestamp when the event is received by CloudWatch, which will have
a delay that can hamper event correlation. 

 WHY PROMPTS ARE THE NEW IOCS YOU DIDN'T SEE COMING! (8 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 As proven by the Anthropic report on the malicious uses of Claude,
threat actors are increasingly using LLMs to aid in their activities.
Prompts should be classified as IoCs, or LLM TTPs. Prompts can be used
to construct NOVA threat hunting rules based on possible prompts for
the scenarios identified in the Anthropic report.

 MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE FILE PICKER FLAW GRANTS APPS FULL CLOUD ACCESS —
EVEN WHEN UPLOADING JUST ONE FILE (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cybersecurity researchers discovered a flaw in Microsoft's OneDrive
File Picker that could allow websites to access users' entire cloud
storage instead of just selected files. The issue affects apps like
ChatGPT, Slack, and Trello due to overly broad OAuth permissions and
vague consent screens. Microsoft acknowledged the problem but hasn't
provided a fix yet. 

 MICROSOFT ENTRA DESIGN LETS GUEST USERS GAIN AZURE CONTROL,
RESEARCHERS SAY (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 BeyondTrust researchers found that guest users in Microsoft Azure can
create and transfer Azure subscriptions, gaining "Owner" privileges
without admin approval. Guests with billing authority can use
Microsoft's transfer feature to move subscriptions, bypassing normal
access controls. Microsoft states this supports multi-tenant
scenarios, but enabling it by default poses significant security risks
that organizations need to address with subscription policies and
guest account audits.
