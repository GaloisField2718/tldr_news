ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PROJECTSEND CVE-2024–11680 EXPLOITED IN THE WILD (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 ProjectSend is a moderately popular open source web application for
hosting file-sharing servers. An authentication bypass vulnerability
that was discovered in January 2023 and has had Nuclei and Metasploit
templates available for months has just been assigned a CVE. The delay
in the assignment of the CVE is problematic as VulnCheck researchers
have noted only 1% of servers being patched and evidence of active
exploitation on many others. 

 ANNIEMAC DATA BREACH IMPACTS 171,000 PEOPLE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AnnieMac Home Mortgage experienced a data breach affecting 171,000
people, with hackers accessing personal information like names and
Social Security numbers between August 21-23. The company is offering
free credit monitoring. It has assured that it hasn't seen any misuse
of the stolen data. 

 CODE FOUND ONLINE EXPLOITS LOGOFAIL TO INSTALL BOOTKITTY LINUX
BACKDOOR (6 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers found a Linux malware exploit called LogoFAIL that
hijacks device boot processes by bypassing Secure Boot. The weaponized
code, discovered on a web server, can inject malicious firmware and
potentially install a Linux bootkit, marking a shift from theoretical
to real-world threat.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GAME ENGINES: AN UNDETECTED PLAYGROUND FOR MALWARE LOADERS (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Check Point researchers have detected a new malware campaign that has
infected over 17K machines since late June. The new campaign uses the
Godot cross-platform gaming engine to execute GDScript code, which can
trigger the GodLoader malware loader. The current variant of this
malware employs several sandbox-evasion techniques such as checking
for the presence of 3D acceleration and checking for the amount of
free space available. After infection, the script adds the full C:\\
disk to the Microsoft Defender exclusion list and then downloads
further malware from Bitbucket. The current variant targets Windows
systems but Check Point researchers have provided PoCs for Linux and
macOS. 

 FLYING UNDER THE RADAR - SECURITY EVASION TECHNIQUES (8 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Cybersecurity is an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between attackers and
defenders. Phishing techniques have evolved from simple credit card
theft to sophisticated attacks using device mimicry, social
engineering, and evasion tactics like randomized resources, multi-step
redirections, and AI-powered tools to bypass traditional security
measures. This post dives into these techniques. 

 EDR SILENCERS AND BEYOND: EXPLORING METHODS TO BLOCK EDR
COMMUNICATION - PART 1 (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article discusses a novel technique that blocks EDR (Endpoint
Detection and Response) communications by manipulating the Windows
Name Resolution Policy Table (NRPT) to redirect DNS queries for EDR
domains to localhost or invalid IP addresses. The NRPT method can
effectively prevent Microsoft Defender for Endpoint from sending data
by manipulating DNS resolution, though it requires administrative
permissions. The article also covers detection opportunities through
PowerShell command execution and registry changes and suggests
mitigation strategies for EDR vendors such as monitoring NRPT changes
and implementing backup IP addresses for critical FQDNs.

 PHISHING-RESISTANT MFA SUCCESS STORY: USDA'S FIDO IMPLEMENTATION (7
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) primarily uses personal
identity verification (PIV) cards for authentication but found that it
could not solely rely on PIV cards for situations like when there were
temporary employees or for the waiting period before a PIV card can be
issued. To solve these issues, users were originally given an
exception policy that allowed for username and password login, which
was phishing prone. To improve its systems, USDA leveraged a
centralized Entra ID system to roll out FIDO MFA using either Windows
Hello for Business or FIPS-140 security keys. Leveraging FIDO + SSO
allowed the USDA to protect over 600 applications through gradual
organizational maturity. 

 IMPORTANT CHANGES TO CLOUDTRAIL EVENTS FOR IAM IDENTITY CENTER (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 AWS IAM Identity Center is streamlining its CloudTrail events to
simplify user identification in CloudTrail and enhance the correlation
between IAM Identity Center users and external directory services like
Okta or Microsoft Active Directory. Specifically, IAM Identity Center
will replace userName and principalID fields under the user identity
element in CloudTrail events with the user ID and Identity Store ARN
when a user signs into the console or accesses the AWS CLI. IAM
Identity Center will also be omitting the value of a group's display
name in CloudTrail events when a group is created or updated. Specific
examples and transition guidance are provided in the blog post. 

 RANSOMWARE GANGS SEEK PEN TESTERS TO BOOST QUALITY (4 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Cybercriminals are actively recruiting cybersecurity professionals on
underground forums to develop sophisticated ransomware and dark AI
models. They are aiming to enhance their malware's resilience and
reduce vulnerability detection, reflecting a more professional
approach to malicious software development.
