 SAAS BREACHES SURGED 300% IN 2024, WITH ATTACKERS BREACHING CORE
SYSTEMS IN AS LITTLE AS 9 MINUTES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 A new report by Obsidian Security reveals a massive spike in YoY data
breaches. In 99% of analyzed breaches, the initial target was the
Identity Provider (IdP).

📚 Read the 2025 SaaS Security Threat Report [4] to find out:

 	* Why SaaS identities are the new frontline.
 	* How traditional defenses are failing against new SaaS attack
patterns.
 	* What Obsidian learned from managing the industry's largest breach
data repository [5] and direct involvement in +150 incident responses.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CALIFORNIA CRYOBANK CONFIRMA DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 California Cryobank, one of the largest reproductive tissue banks in
the world, has disclosed a data breach affecting an undisclosed number
of Americans. The hackers potentially stole data that includes SSNs,
driver's license numbers, financial account numbers, and health
insurance information. No known threat actor has claimed
responsibility for the attack. 

 CRITICAL AMI MEGARAC BUG CAN LET ATTACKERS HIJACK AND BRICK SERVERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 MegaRAC BMC software enables remote server management, allowing
admins to troubleshoot as if present. Eclypsium researchers identified
a CVSS 10 vulnerability permitting remote, unauthenticated attackers
to control affected servers. AMI, the software's developer, has issued
patches to OEM manufacturers for customer rollout. 

 USE ONE VIRTUAL MACHINE TO OWN THEM ALL — ACTIVE EXPLOITATION OF
VMWARE ESX HYPERVISOR ESCAPE ESXICAPE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 VMware has released patches for three zero-day vulnerabilities in
ESXi, allowing threat actors to escape the hypervisor and access
critical server data. The vulnerabilities are actively being exploited
in the wild, posing a significant risk to organizations using VMware
environments. It is crucial to patch affected systems promptly to
prevent potential security breaches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW VULNERABILITY IN GITHUB COPILOT AND CURSOR: HOW HACKERS CAN
WEAPONIZE CODE AGENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers from Pillar Security have discovered a new prompt
injection technique on Cursor and GitHub Copilot. These systems use
rules files to guide the prompting for the LLM, which is often
distributed by open-source projects or from other untrusted locations.
The attack involves utilizing invisible Unicode characters to hide
malicious instructions for the LLM that can be used to instruct it to
poison the generated code. 

 TURNING THE SECURITY FLYWHEEL (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post outlines seven security flywheels: reducing costs to raise
security baselines, transitioning threat intelligence from push to
pull, creating digital twins through asset inventory, enhancing
detection via red teaming, identifying adjacent business benefits of
security measures, implementing continuous control monitoring, and
forming federated teams that seek assistance instead of pushing
initiatives. Each flywheel creates a cycle where initial investments
yield benefits that can be reinvested, ultimately easing the burden on
security teams while sustaining or improving security posture. 

 BYPASSING WINDOWS DEFENDER APPLICATION CONTROL WITH LOKI C2 (11
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Attackers can bypass Windows Defender Application Control with
LOLBINs and Electron apps using tools like Loki C2. Modifying
JavaScript in trusted Electron apps enables Node.js code injection to
interact with the OS, allowing the execution of malicious payloads and
the creation of advanced C2 agents like Dragon.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AWS IAM POLICY VISUALIZER (WEB APP) [12] 

 AWS IAM Policy Visualizer is a web app that visualizes the relations
in an IAM policy in graph format. The tool also provides a search
function for large policies. 

 CVSS-BT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 cvss-bt enriches the NVD CVSS scores to include Temporal/Threat
Metrics. 

 STRINGREAPER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 StringReaper extracts strings, such as JWT tokens and credentials,
from remote process memory, saving time in engagements. It can filter
memory regions and includes features like listing target sections and
displaying remote environment strings.

 NEW AKIRA RANSOMWARE DECRYPTOR CRACKS ENCRYPTION KEYS USING GPUS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A researcher released an open-source decryptor for Akira ransomware
that brute forces encryption keys. Akira generates unique keys for
each file using four timestamp seeds, hashes them through 1,500
rounds, and encrypts them with another key, appending them at the end
of each file. The researcher analyzed logs to estimate when the
ransomware was active and used 16 4090s via RunPod & Vast.ai to
decrypt a friend's files in 10 hours. 

 THE GREAT CNAPP RE-BUNDLE (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 With Check Point and Palo Alto exiting CNAPP, the field has
consolidated around Wiz and a few leaders, losing much of its previous
hype. CNAPP tools will revert to their components: CSPM for
vulnerability management, ASPM for secure code development, and CADR
for responding to cloud alerts. 

 MALWARE CAMPAIGN 'DOLLYWAY' BREACHED 20,000 WORDPRESS SITES (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A malware campaign called 'DollyWay' has compromised over 20,000
WordPress sites globally, redirecting users to harmful sites since
2016. The campaign has evolved to include advanced evasion techniques
and monetization strategies. GoDaddy researchers have linked this
operation to a larger scam redirection system named 'DollyWay World
Domination.'

Thompson's sentence was too lenient for stealing data from millions of
customers, and the case is now going back to the district court for
resentencing. 

 RESEARCHERS USE AI JAILBREAK ON TOP LLMS TO CREATE CHROME INFOSTEALER
(2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Researchers used AI tools to create malware that can steal login
