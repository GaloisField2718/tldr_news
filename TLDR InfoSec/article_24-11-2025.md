ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GRAFANA PATCHES CVSS 10.0 SCIM FLAW ENABLING IMPERSONATION AND
PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A critical vulnerability in Grafana's SCIM user management feature
(CVE-2025-41115) allowed attackers to impersonate users or escalate
privileges if certain settings were enabled. Only Grafana Enterprise
versions 12.0.0 to 12.2.1 with SCIM activated were affected. The flaw,
found internally, was quickly patched. Users are strongly urged to
update to the latest secure release to prevent exploitation. 

 LINE MESSAGING BUGS OPEN ASIAN USERS TO CYBER ESPIONAGE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Researchers discovered major security flaws in the messaging app
LINE, which is widely used in Asia. These bugs let attackers replay
messages, impersonate users, and access plain-text details, all due to
weak custom encryption. The risks are amplified because LINE handles
everything from banking to government services, yet there are no
current plans to fix the vulnerabilities, leaving millions exposed. 

 IBERIA DISCLOSES CUSTOMER DATA LEAK AFTER VENDOR SECURITY BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Spanish flag carrier Iberia suffered a data leak after a third-party
vendor was breached. Iberia has notified customers. The exposed data
includes full names, email addresses, and loyalty card numbers, but
not passwords or financial information. This notice comes days after a
77GB trove of data allegedly stolen from the airline surfaced on
hacker forums.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Attack Surface Management is about continuously identifying and
tracking all digital assets and potential entry points that attackers
could exploit within an organization. This includes everything from
obvious domains and public APIs to obscure subdomains, old servers,
cloud resources, mobile apps, code repositories, and even
collaboration tools such as Slack or Trello. The attack surface
changes constantly as new assets are spun up and others become
forgotten or misconfigured, often outside regular security practices.
The key is ongoing discovery and reduction - eliminating unnecessary
assets, restricting access, hardening configurations, securing supply
chains, and monitoring for leaks - because attackers look for what you
overlook, not just what you defend. 

 FROM CODE TO BOARDROOM: A GENAI GRC APPROACH TO SUPPLY CHAIN RISK (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Traditional GRC approaches fail to address GenAI-driven supply chain
risks, such as shadow AI adoption (vendors using public LLMs for code
generation without disclosure) and model drift (AI systems changing
behavior over time, exposing data or introducing regulatory
violations). This article proposes a GenAI GRC framework that uses
LLMs for contextual intelligence across unstructured data sources,
continuous monitoring via a “digital trust ledger” that
dynamically scores vendor risk, and regulatory synthesis to maintain
compliance with evolving requirements such as the EU DORA and AI Act.
CISOs should pilot this approach by monitoring critical vendors'
self-attestations against their public digital footprint, shifting
from static compliance reporting to predictive risk velocity metrics
that translate technical vulnerabilities into boardroom-ready
strategic resilience indicators. 

 INTUITION-DRIVEN OFFENSIVE SECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Penetration tests typically focus on finding long lists of bugs in a
small time scope and limited attack surface, but attackers are not
restricted by time or other scoping and hunt for smaller numbers of
critical vulnerabilities. To address this gap, testers should have a
holistic view of the application from a user, source code, and
architectural perspective, test assumptions that were made during
development, and search for a small number of deep bugs. Real
offensive security should focus on following intuition, finding the
truth, and focusing on impact.

 QUIET RIOT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Quiet Riot is an unauthenticated enumeration tool that validates the
existence of AWS Account IDs, Azure AD users, and Google Workspace
users by exploiting differences in error messages across cloud service
APIs. The tool achieves ~1,100 checks/second by using a multi-threaded
API to AWS services like SNS, ECR, and KMS, though exhaustively
scanning all possible AWS Account IDs would still take years from a
single account. It requires valid AWS credentials to provision
resources, but performs unauthenticated reconnaissance by observing
service-specific error responses when accessing non-existent versus
existing principals.

 HOW TO KNOW IF YOUR ASUS ROUTER IS ONE OF THOUSANDS HACKED BY
CHINA-STATE HACKERS (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A China-linked hacking group has compromised thousands of older Asus
routers, mainly in Asia, by exploiting vulnerabilities in unsupported
models. The hacked devices, named in the WrtHug campaign, are likely
being reserved for covert espionage. Users can check for compromise by
examining their router's certificate details. They are advised to
upgrade hardware and disable remote access features to enhance
security. 

 SEC DROPS SOLARWINDS LAWSUIT THAT PAINTED A TARGET ON CISOS
EVERYWHERE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The SEC has dropped its lawsuit against SolarWinds and its Chief
Information Security Officer, who were accused of misleading investors
about security practices before the 2020 SUNBURST attack. SolarWinds
welcomed the dismissal as vindication, hoping it would relieve
pressure on CISOs across the industry. 

 FCC REVERSAL REMOVES FEDERAL CYBER SAFEGUARDS TARGETING TELECOM
WEAKNESSES POST-SALT TYPHOON ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The FCC reversed a ruling from January that required US telecom
providers to implement and annually certify cybersecurity risk
management plans under CALEA, removing federal mandates established
after the Salt Typhoon attacks that compromised major carriers and
exposed at least 200 US organizations. Security experts criticized the
rollback as “shockingly incompetent,” noting it eliminates the
only concrete federal regulatory response to attacks that allowed
Chinese state actors to access wiretap systems, record calls, and
geolocate millions of individuals, including high-ranking US
officials. The reversal came after heavy lobbying by compromised
telecom providers that failed to document their remediation efforts,
raising concerns about national security at a time when
telecommunications infrastructure remains vulnerable to nation-state
attacks.
