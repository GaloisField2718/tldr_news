 STEP INSIDE THE BUSINESS OF MODERN CYBERCRIME (SPONSOR) [4] 

 On March 18, Huntress [5] hosts _declassified [6], a live, raw intel
drop on the dark economy of cybercrime, where John Hammond joins
YourTuber Jim Browning to show you exactly what cybercriminal
organizations look like. 

You'll see: 

✔️An in-depth look at the business processes and technologies used
by both legit organizations and their cybercriminal counterparts

✔️Insights into how threat actors organize, communicate, and
execute attacks using the same business tools you use

✔️Actionable strategies to anticipate, spot, and defend against
adversaries who think and operate like your own team

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GOOGLE API KEYS WEREN'T SECRETS. BUT THEN GEMINI CHANGED THE RULES
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Truffle Security discovered that enabling the Gemini API on a Google
Cloud project silently grants existing API keys, including those
publicly embedded in client-side JavaScript for services like Maps and
Firebase, access to sensitive Gemini endpoints (CWE-1188, CWE-269). A
scan of the November 2025 Common Crawl dataset identified 2,863 live
Google API keys vulnerable to this privilege escalation, affecting
major financial institutions, security companies, and Google itself.
Organizations should audit all GCP projects for the Generative
Language API, restrict or rotate any unrestricted or publicly exposed
keys, and verify that no Gemini-capable keys are embedded in
client-side code or public repositories. 

 MALICIOUS NEXT.JS REPOS TARGET DEVELOPERS VIA FAKE JOB INTERVIEWS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Microsoft discovered Trojanized Next.js repositories linked to North
Korea's Lazarus APT that deliver backdoors through fake
job-recruitment coding challenges, achieving RCE and persistent C2
access on developer machines. The repositories exploit VS Code
workspace automation via malicious .vscode/tasks.json files or embed
obfuscated loaders in build assets that fetch attacker-controlled
JavaScript at runtime. Security teams should enforce strict IDE trust
policies, monitor for anomalous Node.js outbound connections, and
treat developer workflows as a privileged attack surface. 

 CISCO SAYS HACKERS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITING A CRITICAL BUG TO BREAK INTO
BIG CUSTOMER NETWORKS SINCE 2023 (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hackers have abused a max‑severity 10.0 flaw in Cisco Catalyst
SD‑WAN gear since at least 2023 to gain top‑level access, maintain
stealthy persistence, and spy on or steal data from large enterprises
and critical infrastructure worldwide. Governments, including the US,
UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, warn of global targeting.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ABUSING CORTEX XDR LIVE TERMINAL AS A C2 - INFOGUARD LABS (7 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 InfoGuard researchers demonstrated that Palo Alto's Cortex XDR Live
Terminal feature can be abused as a pre-installed, EDR-trusted C2
channel, offering command execution, file transfer, and evasion
capabilities through traffic that blends natively into enterprise
network flows. The attack exploits a trivial URL validation flaw in
cortex-xdr-payload.exe and the absence of mutual authentication or
cryptographic command signing, allowing attackers to redirect
connections to their own infrastructure via cross-tenant hijacking or
a custom WebSocket server. Defenders should monitor for
cortex-xdr-payload.exe spawned by any parent process other than
cyserver.exe, while Palo Alto's claimed fix in versions 8.7-8.9 was
not confirmed effective as of February. 

 NEW AIRSNITCH ATTACK BREAKS WI-FI ENCRYPTION IN HOMES, OFFICES, AND
ENTERPRISES (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AirSnitch exploits low-level Wi-Fi behavior to bypass client
isolation, enabling bidirectional MitM from any SSID on the same AP
against popular consumer and enterprise gear. Attackers can steal
cookies, credentials, and RADIUS secrets, pivot between guest and
corporate networks, and poison DNS, challenging assumptions about
guest Wi-Fi safety and pushing networks toward stricter zero‑trust
segmentation and careful AP/VLAN design. 

 THE POST-RAMP ERA: ALLEGATIONS, FRAGMENTATION, AND THE REBUILDING OF
THE RANSOMWARE UNDERGROUND (9 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 In January 2026, the FBI-led seizure of the RAMP forum dismantled a
central hub for ransomware coordination but mainly shattered trust and
pushed actors into more fragmented spaces, such as the closed,
pay-to-enter T1erOne and the open forum Rehub. Competing narratives
about leaked RAMP data and possible insider abuse have reinforced
fears of honeypots, driving a shift toward smaller, tightly vetted
communities and parallel use of low-barrier platforms.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 32% OF LLM PENTEST FINDINGS ARE SERIOUS VULNERABILITES — HIGHER
THAN ANY OTHER ASSET TYPE (SPONSOR) [13] 

 ...And only 21% of serious LLM vulnerabilities are actually resolved,
the lowest among all pentest types. Cobalt [13] combed data from
16,000 LLM pentests and the results are not pretty. They indicate that
most teams are prioritizing quick fixes over complex problem solving.

 AUTOPIFF (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 AutoPiff is a semantic analysis engine that automates the detection
of security-relevant changes in Windows kernel driver patches using 58
YAML-based rules across 22 vulnerability categories, including
use-after-free fixes, bounds check additions, and IOCTL input
validation. The framework runs as a Karton microservice pipeline
integrating Ghidra decompilation, function matching, call-graph
reachability analysis, and exploitability scoring to reduce manual
driver pair analysis from 4-12 hours to under 5 minutes. Designed for
silent patch detection and 1-day vulnerability research, it tracks 50+
dangerous API sinks and alerts on high-scoring findings via Telegram.

 Gambit Security's AI-powered resilience platform, Balens, maps
environments, security products, and backups to uncover gaps, validate
recovery paths in real-time, and ensure business continuity against
ransomware and disruptions.

MISCELLANEOUS

 NEVER BUY A .ONLINE DOMAIN (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A developer's .online domain was suspended via serverHold by registry
operator Radix after Google Safe Browsing flagged the site, with no
prior notification or grace period. The suspension created a Catch-22
where Google required DNS-based domain verification to review the
flag, but the registry refused to reactivate DNS until Google removed
it. The incident highlights the risks of non-.com TLDs with aggressive
abuse policies and reinforces the importance of pre-registering
domains in Google Search Console and adding uptime monitoring even for
simple landing pages. 

 GOOGLE CATCHES BEIJING SPIES USING SHEETS TO SPREAD ESPIONAGE ACROSS
4 CONTINENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Google Threat Intelligence disrupted UNC2814, a China-linked
espionage group that compromised 53 victims across 42 countries by
targeting telecoms and government organizations with a novel backdoor
called Gridtide that abuses Google Sheets API for C2 communication.
The group, tracked since 2017, escalated privileges via SSH lateral
movement and deployed SoftEther VPN Bridge for persistent encrypted
connections, with infrastructure dating back to July 2018. Google
terminated all attacker-controlled Cloud Projects, disabled known
infrastructure, and revoked the Sheets API access used for C2
operations. 

 THE BLAST RADIUS PROBLEM: STOLEN CREDENTIALS ARE WEAPONIZING AGENTIC
AI (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 IBM X-Force data shows high volumes of unauthenticated
vulnerabilities and a surge in infostealer‑driven credential theft,
including hundreds of thousands of stolen ChatGPT logins. Attackers
use AI and agentic systems to expand blast radius, pivot through
supply chains, and blur criminal and nation‑state tradecraft.
