ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TOYS “R” US CANADA WARNS CUSTOMERS' INFO LEAKED IN DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Toys “R” Us Canada has sent notices to customers of a security
incident in which threat actors leaked data they stole from its
systems. The breached data includes full names, physical addresses,
email addresses, and phone numbers. 

 SELF-SPREADING GLASSWORM MALWARE HITS OPENVSX, VA CODE REGISTRIES (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Endpoint security firm Koi Security uncovered a new self-spreading
malware targeting developers, embedded in VS Code and OpenVSX
extensions. The malware was pushed via hidden code in compromised
extensions, which downloaded an infostealer that stole cryptocurrency
wallet data and credentials for GitHub, npm, and OpenVSX accounts. The
malware also attempts to infect any extensions it gains access to to
self-propagate. 

 NEW COPHISH ATTACK STEALS OAUTH TOKENS VIA COPILOT STUDIO AGENTS (3
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 DataDog Security Labs identified a new phishing method exploiting
Microsoft's Copilot Studio chatbots. Attackers can tailor the Login
topic to create convincing phishing pages hosted on
copilotstudio.microsoft.com. The attack involves administrators
approving permission requests from the application, which can be a
“demo website” that does not need Microsoft's verification.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OPENAI ATLAS OMNIBOX PROMPT INJECTION: URLS THAT BECOME JAILBREAKS (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Agentic browsers like OpenAI Atlas are vulnerable to exploitation if
input boundaries are not strictly enforced. Attackers can create
strings that look like URLs but contain natural-language commands,
which the omnibox might interpret as user intent. This can allow
malicious actors to override user commands, leading to unintended or
harmful actions, such as opening phishing sites or executing
destructive instructions. 

 MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE AND REIMAGINING
THEIR ROLE IN MODERN DETECTION (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 File hashes, IP addresses, and domains are usually seen as indicators
of compromise (IoCs), but they have limited value in investigations
because adversaries can easily alter them. These IoCs can be more
insightful if supplemented with additional contextual data like fuzzy
hashes, GeoIP information, and domain reputation. As AI enhances
malware developers' abilities, IoCs will no longer serve as standalone
alerts but will evolve into data points that help build a
comprehensive understanding of a threat actor's behavior. 

 USING LLMS AS A REVERSE ENGINEERING SIDEKICK (10 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post demonstrates how to use LLMs with Model Context Protocol
(MCP) servers integrated into IDA Pro and Ghidra to accelerate malware
reverse engineering through automated function analysis, code
documentation, and variable renaming. Testing on IcedID malware
compared cloud-based Claude Sonnet 3.7 ($2.91-$13.24 per analysis,
18-11 minutes) against local Ollama/Devstral models ($0 cost, 22-46
minutes), with cloud models providing more thorough analysis but at a
higher expense. Key limitations include token costs escalating with
file complexity, context window truncation causing local models to
forget instructions mid-analysis, and security risks from prompt
injection, tool poisoning, and potential data exfiltration when using
untrusted MCP servers.

 WHEN YOUR AI BROWSER BECOMES YOUR ENEMY: THE COMET SECURITY DISASTER
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AI-powered browsers promise convenience but can unintentionally
follow dangerous instructions hidden in web content, risking user
security. Comet's recent vulnerability exposed how easily AIs can be
manipulated. They are like naive assistants who often cannot
distinguish malicious commands from user input. A simple hidden
command can hijack and send private data to a thief. 

 NSO PERMANENTLY BARRED FROM TARGETING WHATSAPP USERS WITH PEGASUS
SPYWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A federal judge issued a permanent injunction against NSO, banning it
from using Pegasus spyware on WhatsApp users and requiring it to
delete illegally obtained data. The ruling, from Meta's lawsuit,
revealed that Pegasus infected activists', diplomats', and
journalists' devices. Punitive damages were reduced, but the case sets
a precedent that enhances privacy protections and makes attacks on
encrypted platforms like WhatsApp riskier. 

 HOW CLOUDFLARE'S CLIENT-SIDE SECURITY MADE THE NPM SUPPLY CHAIN
ATTACK A NON-EVENT (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Attackers used phishing to compromise npm maintainer accounts in
September, injecting malicious code into 18 popular packages with over
2 billion weekly downloads to steal cryptocurrency and credentials
from CI/CD pipelines. Cloudflare's Page Shield, using ML-based
analysis of 3.5 billion scripts daily, detected all compromised
packages with 98% precision and 90% recall by identifying obfuscated
code and changes to wallet interfaces. Organizations should audit
dependencies, rotate credentials, pin safe versions, and consider
Cloudflare's Client-Side Risk Assessment for supply chain security.
