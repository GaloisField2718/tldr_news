ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL FLAWS IN OLLAMA AI FRAMEWORK COULD ENABLE DOS, MODEL THEFT,
AND POISONING (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers identified six security vulnerabilities in Ollama, an
open-source LLM framework, related to issues like denial-of-service
and path traversal. Four have been patched. Users are advised to
filter exposed endpoints for the remaining vulnerabilities through
proxies or firewalls. 

 CANADA ORDERS TIKTOK TO CLOSE OFFICES OVER ‘SECURITY RISKS' (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Canada has ordered TikTok to cease business operations in the
country, citing national security risks. Users can still access and
post content. The government's decision affects TikTok's Vancouver and
Toronto offices but doesn't ban the app. TikTok plans to challenge the
order, stating it will destroy hundreds of local jobs. 

 VULNERABILITIES OF REALTEK SD CARD READER DRIVER, PART 1 (17 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 The Realtek SD card reader driver has multiple vulnerabilities that
allow unauthorized access to kernel memory, including leaking kernel
memory and writing to arbitrary kernel addresses. These
vulnerabilities can be exploited through specific control codes, such
as IOCTL_SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT. They enable users to read and write
physical memory from user mode via the DMA capability of the device.
Exploiting these flaws can lead to significant Windows kernel memory
exploration and manipulation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BREAKING DOWN MULTIPART PARSERS: FILE UPLOAD VALIDATION BYPASS (22
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Parsers often fail to fully comply with RFC standards, allowing for
various ways to bypass file upload validation. Techniques like
altering headers, duplicating parameters, and manipulating content
types can deceive validation mechanisms. Attackers can slip malicious
inputs past security measures by exploiting loopholes in parsers'
handling of multipart data. 

 HTTP SECURITY HEADERS: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO HTTP HEADERS (20 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post defines all the security headers that are essential for
protecting web applications from various vulnerabilities, such as
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. These headers provide critical
security measures like controlling cross-origin resource sharing and
preventing unauthorized sharing of browsing contexts. Websites can
enhance security and ensure a safe browsing experience for users by
implementing and configuring these headers properly. 

 EXPLOITING A BLIND FORMAT STRING VULNERABILITY IN MODERN BINARIES: A
CASE STUDY FROM PWN2OWN IRELAND 2024 (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post explains how an exploit was developed to gain write access
to the stack by manipulating a looping pointer and creating a double
stack pointer. The exploit involved constructing a Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) chain within the stack frame of a vulnerable
function using format string techniques. The final steps of the
exploit involved adjusting the stack pointer to execute the prepared
ROP chain, ultimately leading to the successful exploitation of the
blind format string vulnerability.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SYMBIOTIC SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 Symbiotic integrates vulnerability detection and remediation
capabilities directly into the IDE. The platform also provides
just-in-time training to developers so that they have the information
on how to write secure code. 

 TWYN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Twyn is a security tool that compares the names of dependencies
against a set of the most popular ones to determine if there are any
similarities between them, preventing users from using a potentially
illegitimate one. 

 SASTSWEEP (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Sastsweep is a tool designed for identifying vulnerabilities in open
source codebases at scale. It can gather and filter for key metrics on
repositories like project size and popularity. Sastsweep automatically
detects potential vulnerabilities using Semgrep and provides a
streamlined HTML report.

 TRUMP PLANS TO DISMANTLE BIDEN AI SAFEGUARDS AFTER VICTORY (4 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Trump could dismantle Biden's 2023 AI Executive Order. This would
affect the US AI Safety Institute and reporting requirements. His team
has characterized NIST's AI safety standards as an attempt to control
speech through "woke" safety requirements. 

 A LOOK AT THE LATEST POST-QUANTUM SIGNATURE STANDARDIZATION
CANDIDATES (18 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This post provides a detailed look into fourteen post-quantum
signature schemes. ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, and Falcon are notable standards
for the second round of "signatures on ramp competition" operated by
NIST. Falcon faces challenges due to its complex signing process,
while HAWK shows promise for faster and simpler signatures. The aim is
to improve post-quantum signature schemes for better performance in
TLS connections. 

 NOKIA SAYS HACKERS LEAKED THIRD-PARTY APP SOURCE CODE (2 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 Nokia investigated a data breach claim and found that leaked source
code belonged to a third party, with no impact on company or customer
data. The hacker tried to sell the data, which included SSH keys and
logins, but Nokia denies any breach affecting its systems or data. The
leaked source code was for a third-party app not developed by Nokia.
The company will continue to monitor the situation closely.
