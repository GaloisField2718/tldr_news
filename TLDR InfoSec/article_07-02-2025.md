ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DEEP JAVA LIBRARY VULNERABILITY ALLOWS PATH TRAVERSAL (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 A new vulnerability in the ZipUtils.unzip and TarUtils.untar
utilities in the Deep Java Library allows for absolute path traversal.
These utilities are used by Deep Java Library when extracting models
to load. The vulnerability exists because the absolute path is not
properly validated. A malicious attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to overwrite system files. 

 GO MODULE MIRROR SERVED BACKDOOR TO DEVS FOR 3+ YEARS (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 Researchers from Socket discovered that Go Module Mirror had been
hosting a malicious Go package for over three years. Go Module Mirror
is a caching service that Google runs to cache modules for quicker
downloads when building Go programs. The attackers typosquatted an
archived Go package, published a version with a backdoor embedded, and
then changed their repo back to look like the benign module. 

 EXPERTS FLAG SECURITY, PRIVACY RISKS IN DEEPSEEK AI APP (4 MINUTE
READ) [7]

and privacy concerns about the DeepSeek AI app from China. He notes
that the app sends a lot of user data in unencrypted form and device
information to Chinese companies, posing risks. The author also urges
organizations to remove the DeepSeek iOS app due to security threats
identified by NowSecure.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REPLACING A SPACE HEATER FIRMWARE OVER WIFI (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security team discovered a vulnerability in a Govee smart space
heater allowing complete firmware control through a man-in-the-middle
attack on local networks. After extended disclosure discussions with
Govee in early 2024, the product was recalled as the flaw could enable
malicious control of device operations. 

 SCATTERBRAIN: UNMASKING THE SHADOW OF POISONPLUG'S OBFUSCATOR (15
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Since 2022, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has been tracking
a group of malware samples that use the PoisonPlug moniker and employ
a complex obfuscator. The ScatterBrain obfuscator operates in three
different protection modes which determine to what extent it
obfuscates the control flow graph, mutates instructions, and protects
the binary's import table. The post walks through how GTIG reverse
engineered this obfuscator and created a deobfuscator tool. 

 A NETWORK THREAT HUNTER'S GUIDE TO C2 OVER QUIC (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 QUIC is a newer network communication protocol that abbreviates the
typical TCP 3-way handshake as well as adding other features such as a
Communication ID for persistent connections. This post introduces the
QUIC protocol and then sets up a lab environment to analyze the Merlin
QUIC-based C2 with different sets of delays. The post finds that the
Merlin C2 can be detected by RITA with any delay, alternatively, Zeek
logs can be examined for unusually persistent QUIC connections, and
finally, the post also noted a unique QUIC handshake that is only
exhibited by Merlin.
