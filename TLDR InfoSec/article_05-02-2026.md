ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EVEREST RANSOMWARE CLAIMS 90GB DATA THEFT INVOLVING LEGACY POLYCOM
SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Everest ransomware group claimed to have exfiltrated 90GB of
internal data from systems linked to Polycom, now owned by HP Inc.,
including engineering build environments, source code, and technical
documentation for the RMX and RealPresence conferencing platforms.
Evidence suggests the data originated in legacy Polycom environments
from 2017–2019, predating HP's acquisition, though it remains
unclear when the systems were accessed. HP Inc. has not confirmed the
breach. 

 VULNERABILITIES ALLOWED FULL COMPROMISE OF GOOGLE LOOKER INSTANCES (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Tenable researchers uncovered LookOut, two flaws in Google Looker
that allow attackers with developer rights to run remote code, steal
secrets, and exfiltrate the internal MySQL database via an auth bypass
and error-based SQL injection. Google patched cloud-hosted instances
in September 2025, but self-hosted deployments must update, though no
active exploitation has been detected. 

 BIG BREACH OR SMOOTH SAILING? MEXICAN GOV'T FACES LEAK ALLEGATIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hacktivist collective Chronus claims to have leaked 2.3TB of data
from at least 25 Mexican government bodies, potentially exposing
personal and healthcare records of 36 million citizens. Mexico's ATDT
argues the dump repackages old breaches from obsolete third‑party
systems, not fresh sensitive data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GATEWAYTOHEAVEN: FINDING A CROSS-TENANT VULNERABILITY IN GCP'S APIGEE
(11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A cross-tenant vulnerability (CVE-2025-13292) discovered in Google
Cloud's Apigee allowed attackers to chain SSRF via the GKE metadata
endpoint, to escalate privileges via Dataflow JAR poisoning, and to
abuse autoscaling to access analytics data across all Apigee tenants,
including plaintext OAuth access tokens. The attack exploited shared
cross-tenant metadata buckets lacking tenant-specific path isolation
and overly permissive service account permissions within tenant
projects. Organizations using managed multi-tenant cloud services
should audit tenant isolation boundaries, restrict access to metadata
endpoints from workloads, and ensure that shared infrastructure
components enforce strict per-tenant scoping. 

 BUILDING SECURITY TO UNLOCK ENGINEERING VELOCITY (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Robinhood built SERA (Secure Enhanced Remote Approval), an internal
platform that replaces VPN-dependent access approvals with
passkey-based biometric authentication, enabling engineers to securely
approve requests from any device. The system uses trusted enrollment
on corporate devices to bootstrap credentials and then enables
flexible remote approvals with tamper-evident audit trails, reducing
approval times by over 20%. This approach demonstrates how
organizations can reduce friction in security incident response and
off-hours workflows without weakening authentication guarantees. 

 EXPLOITING AWS IAM EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS is a highly distributed system, which can lead to delays as
changes propagate across the system. This is known as eventual
consistency. This window can be exploited to recreate deleted or
disabled AWS access keys within a nearly four-second window while the
changes propagate. Disallow the principal from accessing via an SCP,
wait 4 seconds, and then use the standard deletion process to prevent
an attacker from exploiting eventual consistency. Other IAM
operations, such as policy attachment and detachment, and role
assumption, share this vulnerability.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CLAUDE-CODE-TRANSCRIPTS (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 claude-code-transcripts is a Python CLI tool that converts Claude
Code sessions into detailed, shareable HTML pages capturing prompts,
tool calls, thinking traces, and commits. The tool supports both local
Claude Code sessions and Claude Code for web via a reverse-engineered
private API. It is useful for maintaining audit trails of AI-assisted
development decisions and evaluating prompting strategies across
coding agent workflows. 

 ORION SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 Orion provides an AI-driven data protection platform that maps how
sensitive information moves across an organization, detects risky or
abnormal data flows in real time, and automatically prevents leaks and
insider-driven data loss across modern cloud environments. 

 SPICEDB (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Spicedb is an open-source, Google Zanzibar-inspired database for
scalably storing and querying fine-grained authorization data.

 MOZILLA ANNOUNCES SWITCH TO DISABLE ALL FIREFOX AI FEATURES (2 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Following user backlash, Mozilla announced that it will be adding a
toggle to delay current and future AI features. Along with this
toggle, there will be an AI control panel where users can selectively
enable or disable specific features. Features will begin enabled in
the AI control panel until users choose to disable them if they do not
use the “Block AI Enhancements” toggle. 

 APPLE'S NEW IPHONE AND IPAD SECURITY FEATURE LIMITS CELL NETWORKS
FROM COLLECTING PRECISE LOCATION DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Apple has announced a new feature for select iPhones and
cellular-enabled iPads that limits the precision of location data
shared with a customer's cell carrier. Applications that a user has
granted precise location data and emergency calls will still have
access to the user's precise location. 

 NITROGEN RANSOMWARE IS SO BROKEN EVEN THE CROOKS CAN'T UNLOCK YOUR
FILES (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ransomware gang Nitrogen shipped an ESXi encryptor with a fatal bug
that corrupted its own Curve25519 public key, making decryption
mathematically impossible even if victims pay. The slipup turns a
profit-driven campaign into pure destruction: criminals earn nothing
while organizations are left with unrecoverable hypervisors and costly
rebuilds.
