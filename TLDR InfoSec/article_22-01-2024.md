 MILLIONS OF VULNERABILITIES. LIMITED RESOURCES. HOW CAN SECURITY
TEAMS PRIORITIZE RISK? (SPONSOR) [6] 

 As a security leader in 2024, you need to find a way to address
existing exposure without slowing down business growth [7].
Yet, identifying which risks to proactively remediate is becoming
harder than ever before. What's the best path forward?

Black Hat and Brinqa are hosting a CISO fireside chat [8] with Tunde
Oni-Daniel of OneMain Financial, where they‚Äôll discuss ways to:

	* Balance cyber risk exposure and growth
	* Decide which risks should be remediated vs accepted
	* Communicate risk exposure to business stakeholders
	* Adopt the proactive security approach [7] also used by Nestle,
Github, Warner Bros Discovery & more

laterally, and finally attempted to run a large EC2 instance in an
unused region before being blocked. In the second scenario, the
attacker immediately launched crypto mining tasks on ECS Fargate with
25 tasks in 17 regions, showing that this method can be much more
effective.
