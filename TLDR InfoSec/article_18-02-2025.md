various actions one can take if credentials are compromised. 

 HOW TO BYPASS GITHUB'S BRANCH PROTECTION (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mercari presents 7 scenarios in which an attacker with write
permissions to a branch protected GitHub repository can bypass those
protections to merge malicious code without a review. For each of the
first six methods mentioned, Mercari also presents a technical control
to prevent the attack. However, the final scenario, which involves the
attacker adding a commit to a PR that another user created using
GitHub Actions and approving it, does not have a comprehensive defense
mechanism built into GitHub.
