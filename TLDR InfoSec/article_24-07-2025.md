ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MAJOR EUROPEAN HEALTHCARE NETWORK DISCLOSES SECURITY BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 AMEOS Group, an operator of a Central European healthcare network,
suffered a security breach that may have exposed customer, employee,
and partner information. In response to the breach, AMEOS has shut
down all IT systems and terminated all external and internal network
connections while it responds to the incident. AMEOS has stated that
it doesn't currently have evidence of any data being leaked, but it is
continuing to investigate. 

 3.5M RECORDS EXPOSED IN AUSTRALIAN GLOBAL FASHION BRAND DATA BREACH
(4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Jeremiah Fowler discovered an unprotected, unencrypted, and publicly
exposed database containing over 3.5 million PDFs belonging to the
Australian fashion brand SABO. The files contain PII, including names,
physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal
information corresponding to retail and corporate customers. Some of
the PDFs contain multiple orders, suggesting that the number of
affected individuals may be higher than 3.5 million. 

 US NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGENCY REPORTEDLY BREACHED IN MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7]

SharePoint vulnerability affecting 50+ organizations, including the
National Nuclear Security Administration. The zero-day flaw enables
remote access to on-premises SharePoint versions, allowing attackers
to steal documents and sensitive information.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MYTHIC C2 WITH EARLYBIRD INJECTION AND DEFENDER EVASION (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 This post walks through a demo setup of the Mythic C2 framework that
uses redirectors to disguise itself as legitimate WordPress traffic.
The redirectors use a legitimately registered domain and certificates
and use Nginx to offer WordPress as a front end, as well as an api
subdomain that forwards traffic to the C2 server and a dl subdomain
that disguises payloads as font files. The setup also utilizes the
EarlyBird Injection technique, where the loader executes code before
the target process is fully initialized, both in its loader and
through string obfuscation to employ evasion during installation. The
post concludes with a discussion of further enhancements, such as
ensuring domain age before weaponizing it and detection mechanisms for
this setup. 

 WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT TOOLSHELL, THE SHAREPOINT THREAT UNDER MASS
EXPLOITATION (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A critical SharePoint vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770), dubbed
"ToolShell," is being mass-exploited by Chinese government groups,
affecting over 400 systems, including the US National Nuclear Security
Administration. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution,
credential theft, and data exfiltration. Microsoft patched it on
Saturday, but it is being exploited on any company that has not
updated their SharePoint. 

 CHOOSING THE VPN THAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 VPNs mainly serve two purposes: bypassing internet censorship and
remote access to corporate networks, despite being marketed as
security tools. They hide your IP and encrypt traffic, but don't
ensure anonymity (Tor is better), don't fully secure public Wi-Fi
(most traffic is HTTPS), and shift data from your ISP to the VPN
provider. When choosing one, review the provider's business model,
data practices, encryption protocols (prefer OpenVPN or WireGuard),
and verify claims through third-party audits.
