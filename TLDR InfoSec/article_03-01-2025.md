 2025 RANSOMWARE SURVIVAL GUIDE: INFOSTEALERS, EXPLOITS, AND OTHER
RANSOMWARE THREATS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Flashpoint identified 4,500+ ransomware attacks in 2024,
with 53% targeting U.S. companies. Ransomware operations have grown
more sophisticated — strategically combining phishing, infostealers,
and vulnerability exploits to breach defenses.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN ITERM2 (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The popular macOS terminal emulator iTerm2 released a critical
security fix for versions 3.5.6-3.5.10. The vulnerability arises from
a bug in the SSH integration feature which causes input and output to
be logged to a file /tmp/framer.txt on the remote host. Users are
advised to upgrade and remove any /tmp/framer.txt files that may have
been created. 

 NEW DOUBLECLICKJACKING ATTACK EXPLOITS DOUBLE-CLICKS TO HIJACK
ACCOUNTS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Clickjacking attacks are when an attacker utilizes an iframe to trick
a user into clicking on content from a legitimate page that an
attacker is hiding from the user and is largely prevented by modern
browser defenses. A security researcher has introduced a new technique
called DoubleClickjacking where the attacker launches a new window
that covers the original page and prompts the user to double click to
solve a captcha or the like. The page will then listen for the first
click and close itself while having the parent navigate to the target
site and capture the second click, bypassing browser defenses. 

 OVER 3 MILLION MAIL SERVERS WITHOUT ENCRYPTION EXPOSED TO SNIFFING
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Scans from the ShadowServer security threat monitoring platform
Shadowserver has shown that around 3.3 million hosts are running
POP3/IMAP services without TLS encryption enabled and expose usernames
and passwords in plain text when transmitted over the Internet. IMAP
is recommended for accessing emails on multiple devices, while POP3
downloads emails to a single device. Enabling TLS encryption can
protect usernames and passwords from being exposed in plain text
during email exchanges.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE DARK CLOUD AROUND GCP SERVICE ACCOUNTS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dave Bogle of Red Canary steps through the process of investigating a
strange behavior in GCP where a service account's access to GCP wasn't
revoked when the access key was deleted. Bogle discovered that the
token that GCP creates for service account's access access is not
revocable but ultimately this is mentioned in the GCP documentation.
In this post, Bogle walks through how he created detection logic
around this behavior based on his research. 

 IMPLEMENTING TLSH BASED DETECTION TO IDENTIFY MALWARE VARIANTS (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 TLSH is a locality-sensitive, fuzzy hashing mechanism that can be
used to compare two files to determine how similar they are. In this
post, Target's security team walks through how they utilize TLSH for
hunting malware variants of known malware families using Strelka. This
approach requires files to be over 50 bytes in length, regularly
updating a list of known malicious TLSH values, carefully tuning
similarity thresholds, and may not work on packed or obfuscated
malware. 

 NON-INTRUSIVE WEB RECON: TECHNIQUES FROM CHROME DEVTOOLS RECORDER (6
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The article discusses how Chrome DevTools Recorder enables
non-intrusive web reconnaissance by isolating its scripts from the
application's environment. By capturing user interactions without
interference, the Recorder provides valuable insights for building
secure and reliable tools. Lessons from DevTools can guide the design
of tools that support security researchers in uncovering
vulnerabilities without disrupting normal application behavior.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TOOLS EVERY SOC ANALYST SHOULD KNOW (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A collection of tools that can be useful for a SOC Analyst, divided
by category. Categories include: network traffic, analysis, and
detection tools, system logs collection and analysis tools, disk
imaging, live analysis, and offline analysis tools, memory capture and
analysis tools, and threat intelligence tools. 

 CF-HERO (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 CF-Hero is a tool that uncovers the real IP addresses of
Cloudflare-protected websites through DNS reconnaissance and
intelligence sources like Censys and Shodan. It distinguishes between
domains protected by Cloudflare and those that are not to help
validate findings and minimize false positives. The tool offers
advanced features like custom JA3 fingerprint support, concurrent
scanning, and proxy support for comprehensive analysis. 

 OGP-CTF 2024 (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 OGP-CTF is a series of 13 challenges ranging from easy to hard aimed
towards training developers in bug hunting and secure coding. The CTF
is built on Vercel + NextJS, CTFd, and Cloudflare Access.

MISCELLANEOUS

 EXPLORING AWS STS ASSUMEROOT (19 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AWS introduced the AssumeRoot API operation that allows for an IAM
user in a management account of an organization to gain temporary
credentials to the root user of a member account. The Elastic security
team showcases how this privilege can be abused by an attacker to
elevate compromised credentials in a management account to full
compromise of a member account. The post includes Terraform code to
setup the testing environment and detections to detect the attack. 

 BIGGEST PRIVACY EROSION IN 10 YEARS? ON GOOGLE'S POLICY CHANGE
TOWARDS FINGERPRINTING (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Lukasz Olejnik raises concerns about how Google's policy change to
allow device fingerprinting for advertising leads to privacy erosion.
This shift contradicts previous commitments to user privacy,
potentially setting a new standard for data collection in the online
ecosystem. The use of fingerprinting raises questions about
transparency, user control, and the future of internet privacy. 

 FROM REMEDIATION TO MITIGATION: ADDRESSING INSECURE-BY-DESIGN FLAWS
(5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Vectra's Kat Trexler writes about "insecure by design" flaws in cloud
and contrasts them against traditional bugs and feature abuse.
Insecure-by-design flaws in cloud services often stem from fundamental
design issues, requiring more than simple patches for remediation.
Mitigating these vulnerabilities involves a holistic strategy that
involves implementing preventative controls like guardrails and
focusing on detection and response measures.
