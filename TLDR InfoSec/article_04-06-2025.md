 THREATSPIKE RED: UNLIMITED PENTESTING, ONE FIXED PRICE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Pentesting prices are a CFO's worst nightmare. $50K for a web app
test. Another $30K if you want APIs included. Scope creep? That'll be
extra. Need a retest after fixes? Start the procurement process again.

ThreatSpike Red [4] eliminates the sticker shock. One annual price [4]
covers unlimited penetration testing: red team exercises, API testing,
vulnerability scans, infrastructure reviews - everything.

No hourly rates, no change orders, no scope negotiations. No more
rationing security testing because of unpredictable costs. Request
tests whenever threats evolve or code ships.

Get unlimited pentesting from $1500/month [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 THE NORTH FACE WARNS CUSTOMERS OF APRIL CREDENTIAL STUFFING ATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The North Face says hackers stole customer information in a
cyberattack in April. The attack happened because many people reused
passwords from other sites. This is the fourth data breach for the
company since 2020. 

 NEW CHROME ZERO-DAY ACTIVELY EXPLOITED; GOOGLE ISSUES EMERGENCY
OUT-OF-BAND PATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Google released an emergency Chrome update to fix a serious security
flaw. The bug, CVE-2025-5419, is already being used by hackers. The
vulnerability has been flagged as an out-of-bounds read and write
vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. 

 ANDROID MALWARE CROCODILUS ADDS FAKE CONTACTS TO SPOOF TRUSTED
CALLERS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The Crocodilus Android malware can now add fake contacts to trick
users into thinking calls are from trusted people or companies. It has
spread worldwide and added new tools to avoid detection and steal
better data. Experts warn users to only download apps from trusted
sources and use Google Play Protect.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HIGH LEVERAGE SECURITY DECISIONS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security engineer outlines five crucial decisions for startups to
minimize security risks: using an identity provider like Google
Workspace or Okta ($6-15/month), implementing hardware security keys
for phishing-resistant MFA ($50-75/user), and adopting Infrastructure
as Code tools like Terraform for version control. The guide also
suggests leveraging managed cloud services such as AWS Fargate and RDS
over self-managed VMs, and deploying Mobile Device Management to
secure employee endpoints from the outset. The author highlights that
significant security improvements stem from operational excellence and
strategic tool choices rather than additional security processes or
analysts. 

 DEVOPS TOOLS TARGETED FOR CRYPTOJACKING (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Wiz researchers discovered a cryptojacking campaign called
"JINX-0132" targeting misconfigured DevOps servers, including Nomad,
Consul, Docker, and Gitea. Attackers exploit default settings and
vulnerabilities to deploy XMRig miners, avoiding custom malware by
using GitHub repositories. The campaign affects 25% of cloud
environments, with 5% exposed and 30% misconfigured. 

 HOW TO DEPLOY AI SAFELY (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Microsoft's Deputy CISO for AI outlines key principles for safe AI
deployment: understand potential failures and create plans, analyze
entire systems, including humans, continuously assess risks, and
maintain written safety plans. AI errors are intrinsic—treat AI like
"well-intentioned but inexperienced new hires." Emphasize extensive
testing over coding time and careful information presentation across
human-AI boundaries.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 4 BROKEN PARTS OF CYBERSECURITY (SPONSOR) [11] 

 RSA was filled with promises of AI and shift-left. But talk to teams
on the ground and it's a different story, filled with unaddressed
risks, bolted-on tools, and security that slows down development. Here
are the four ways the current approach is failing - and how
develop-first security fix them [11] on the Symbiotic blog [11]. 

 DELEGATIONS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 The Delegations tool enables management of all types of Kerberos
delegations (unconstrained, constrained, and resource-based) in Active
Directory. 

 SBOMMV (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Sbommv is a tool for transferring SBOMs between systems. It is
designed to fetch SBOMs from input sources, translate and validate
them, enrich metadata, and push them to output destinations. 

 PASSWORD PUSHER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Securely share sensitive information with automatic expiration and
deletion after a set number of views or duration, with full audit
logs. Track who, what, and when.

 MICROSOFT, CROWDSTRIKE LEAD EFFORT TO MAP THREAT ACTOR NAMES (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft and CrowdStrike are leading an effort to map different
names for the same cyber threat groups. This helps security teams
better understand and track threats without needing a single standard
name. Other companies like Google and Palo Alto Networks are joining
to make threat info clearer and more useful. 

 META AND YANDEX ARE DE-ANONYMIZING ANDROID USERS' WEB BROWSING
IDENTIFIERS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Meta and Yandex exploit browser protocols to bypass Android security,
linking web browsing to app identities. Their tracking code sends
identifiers from websites to Facebook, Instagram, and Yandex apps via
localhost ports, de-anonymizing users. Google is investigating this
violation of privacy principles. Both companies have confirmed they
have paused the practice.

(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hackers exploited misconfigured DevOps tools such as HashiCorp Nomad,
Consul, Docker, and Gitea to mine Monero cryptocurrency, prompting
security experts to emphasize the need for better protection of these
tools to prevent future attacks.
