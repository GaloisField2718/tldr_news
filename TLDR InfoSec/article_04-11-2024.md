 LEVEL UP YOUR API SECURITY: 3 ESSENTIAL STEPS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 APIs power your systems, but securing them shouldn't feel like a
constant uphill battle. That's why STACKHAWK launched OVERSIGHT‚Äîa
new feature providing a bird's-eye view of API security across your
entire application portfolio. Designed to do more than just create
another dashboard where teams can ‚Äúadmire their problems,‚Äù
Oversight gives real-time insights to quickly pinpoint and fix
security issues. As app portfolios grow, API DISCOVERY, API SECURITY
TESTING, and OVERSIGHT keep security scalable and proactive,
empowering teams to stay ahead of risks.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 THOUSANDS OF HACKED TP-LINK ROUTERS USED IN YEARS-LONG ACCOUNT
TAKEOVER ATTACKS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Chinese hackers are using "Botnet-7777" to conduct stealthy password
spray attacks against Azure cloud accounts, targeting organizations
across multiple sectors. Comprising mainly TP-Link routers, the
8,000-device botnet's distributed nature and low-volume attempts make
detection difficult. 

 BOOKING.COM PHISHERS MAY LEAVE YOU WITH RESERVATIONS (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Scammers stole a Californian hotel's Booking.com credentials and sent
targeted phishing messages to customers via the mobile app requesting
additional information while citing reservation details. Booking.com
confirmed a security breach with a partner but states its internal
systems remain secure. 

 OVER 1K ONLINE SHOPS HACKED TO SHOW FAKE PRODUCT LISTINGS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 HUMAN's Satori Threat Intelligence team detected a new phishing
campaign dubbed Phish n' Ships. The campaign utilizes n-day
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compromised admin credentials
to upload fake SEO-optimized listings to compromised online shops. The
listings redirect users to payment forms that allow the attackers to
steal their credit card information. HUMAN has taken efforts to
disrupt the campaign by reporting fake listings to Google as well as
the online shops.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LESSONS IN SECURITY TOOLING: STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS (11 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Successful security tooling programs require careful vendor selection
based on a comprehensive rubric that prioritizes low false positives
and workflow integration over cost while ensuring engineers aren't
overwhelmed with vulnerabilities by implementing a phased
"crawl-walk-run" approach to remediation. Tool success depends on full
ecosystem integration with auto-creation/closure of vulnerability
tickets, centralized security data lake visibility, and strong
engineering team buy-in through their involvement in tool selection.
Critical mistakes to avoid include selecting tools that create high
operational overhead, failing to achieve complete coverage across all
repositories, and overwhelming engineering teams with too many
vulnerabilities at once instead of focusing on critical issues first. 

 BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY GATT FUZZING (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Research on the Bluetooth Low Energy Generic ATTribute Profile (GATT)
layer revealed vulnerabilities in various Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
stacks. Attack scenarios were defined and a fuzzer was built to test
BLE security. Vulnerabilities like DoS in NimBLE stack and Espressif
GATT server example were discovered and reported. 

 HOW TO DO VULNERABILITY PRIORITIZATION (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This post provides an overview of Opus Security's vulnerability
prioritization process. The strategy begins by utilizing the base CVSS
score and then enriches it with additional information about the
vulnerability such as the availability of exploit code, whether there
are known attackers who are exploiting the vulnerability, and whether
a patch is available. The next level involves adding in environmental
factors such as how the resource is configured and its exposure.

 MICROSOFT HAS DELAYED COPILOT+'S ‚ÄòRECALL' FEATURE YET AGAIN (4
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft's Recall feature, which captures PC screenshots for AI
searching, will be delayed until December. Originally planned for June
with the release of Copilot+ laptops, it was postponed due to security
concerns. Microsoft promises it will be opt-in and removable,
addressing user skepticism about data privacy. 

 EX-DISNEY WORKER ACCUSED OF HACKING COMPUTER MENUS TO ADD
PROFANITIES, ERRORS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A fired Disney World menu production manager allegedly hacked

caught before implementation, the attack cost Disney $150,000. 

 SUNSHINE THROUGH STORMY CLOUDS: BRINGING AWS SECURITY TO MERGERS AND
ACQUISITIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This post describes how to effectively manage AWS security during
mergers and acquisitions through a detailed six-step, 90-day process.
Success requires careful onboarding of AWS accounts into the parent
organization's security tools and monitoring systems while
prioritizing the remediation of critical security risks like
permissive IAM policies and public-facing resources over
lower-severity issues. It is important to build trust with the
acquired team while maintaining security momentum through the
transition period, ultimately working toward full integration into the
parent organization's infrastructure-as-code practices and security
controls.
