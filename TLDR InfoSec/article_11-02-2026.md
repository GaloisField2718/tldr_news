 FIND THE RISKS HIDDEN IN YOUR CODEBASE THAT OTHER SECURITY TOOLS MISS
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Engineering and security teams often rely on tools that reveal only a
narrow slice of what is happening inside their software. The deeper
risks in modern code such as logic failures, unexpected execution
paths, and behavioral deviations from intent rarely appear without
more advanced analysis.

ZeroPath [4] brings these issues into view by examining real
application behavior and exposing problems that conventional
approaches miss. The result is a clearer and more confident
understanding of actual risk and a faster path to meaningful
remediation. You can run ZeroPath on your own repositories in minutes
[4] to see what it uncovers for your team.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CVE-2026-21643: CRITICAL SQL INJECTION IN FORTICLIENTEMS (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Fortinet has patched CVE-2026-21643, a critical SQL injection
vulnerability in the FortiClientEMS GUI that allows unauthenticated
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands by improperly
neutralizing special characters in SQL queries. The flaw affects
FortiClientEMS version 7.4.4. Version 7.4.5 was released as a fix.
Versions 7.2 and 8.0 are unaffected. While no exploitation in the wild
or public proof-of-concept has been observed yet, organizations should
patch urgently, given Fortinet's history as a heavily targeted vendor
per CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog. 

 HACKERS DELIVER GLOBAL GROUP RANSOMWARE OFFLINE VIA PHISHING EMAILS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Forcepoint X-Labs discovered the Phorpiex botnet delivering Global
Group ransomware, a Mamona successor, via phishing emails containing
.lnk files disguised as documents. It leverages living-off-the-land
techniques using PowerShell and Command Prompt for payload delivery.
The ransomware operates in a mute mode that generates encryption keys
locally with ChaCha20-Poly1305 instead of contacting a C2 server,
allowing it to encrypt files on offline machines and evade
network-based detection. After encryption, the malware self-deletes,
destroys Volume Shadow Copies, and appends a .reco extension to locked
files, leaving minimal forensic artifacts. 

 CLAUDE DESKTOP EXTENSIONS ZERO-CLICK RCE EXPOSES OVER 10K USERS TO
SILENT ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at the security firm LayerX uncovered a critical (CVSS
10/10) vulnerability in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT) that could
enable remote code execution (RCE) with no user interaction. In the
proof-of-concept disclosed by LayerX, an attacker would send the
victim a Google Calendar invite containing malicious instructions in
the event description. The victim would then, at some point, ask
Claude to manage their calendar or check events, and the malicious
instructions would be executed. This vulnerability is enabled by the
fact that Claude DXT intentionally runs without any isolation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RECREATING UNCENSORED EPSTEIN PDFS FROM RAW ENCODED ATTACHMENTS (13
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher discovered that the DoJ's latest Epstein
document dump inadvertently included unredacted email attachments as
raw base64-encoded content — left uncensored because the assigned
intern didn't recognize the significance of pages of encoded data
embedded in printed-and-scanned emails. Reconstructing the original
PDFs proved extremely difficult due to poor OCR quality on Courier New
font rendering (where "1" and "l" are nearly indistinguishable), with
multiple commercial and open-source OCR tools failing until a
community-developed pixel-level template-matching approach achieved
99.96% line accuracy and successfully decompressed 39 of 40
FlateDecode streams. The incident highlights how encoding artifacts
and document processing pipelines can inadvertently preserve sensitive
content that redaction workflows miss, and serves as a cautionary tale
for forensic document handling and redaction verification processes. 

 BUGS THAT SURVIVE THE HEAT OF CONTINUOUS FUZZING (17 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Open source maintainers can enroll their projects in OSS-Fuzz
continuous fuzzing at no cost. While this process has detected many
new bugs, the author of this post discovered new bugs in popular
projects due to limited coverage, insufficient coverage of external
dependencies, and insufficient fuzzing coverage of encoding functions.
The author recommends a five step fuzzing process: prepare the code,
iteratively increase code coverage to ideally above 90%, improve
context-sensitive coverage which relies upon state that a fuzzer may
not naturally reach, employ value coverage to discover bugs that the
fuzzer's inputs may be missing, and finally try to hone in on
difficult to detect bugs such as those requiring large inputs or
longer amounts of time. 

 AI-ASSISTED CLOUD INTRUSION ACHIEVES ADMIN ACCESS IN 8 MINUTES (5
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 In November 2025, the Sysdig Threat Research Team (TRT) detected an
account compromise that was notable for the attacker's 8-minute
progression from initial access to administrative privileges, using
LLM assistance. The attacker gained initial access through credentials
discovered in a public S3 bucket. They then used these credentials to
replace the Lambda function code to escalate privileges, move
laterally across 19 different principals, and finally harvest
sensitive data. They also used Bedrock to access cloud-hosted LLMs and
launch GPU instances for model training. The article includes
mitigation recommendations for each step in the attacker's exploit
chain.

 INTRODUCING AUGUSTUS: OPEN SOURCE LLM PROMPT INJECTION TOOL (10
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Augustus is an open-source Go-based LLM vulnerability scanner that
tests models against 210+ adversarial attacks across 47 categories,
including jailbreaks, prompt injection, encoding exploits, data
extraction, and agent manipulation, shipping as a single binary with
support for 28 LLM providers. Inspired by NVIDIA's garak but

 HACKERS USE SIGNAL QR CODES TO SPY ON MILITARY AND POLITICAL LEADERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Germany's BSI and BfV warned that state-backed hackers are targeting
military leaders, diplomats, and journalists across Europe by abusing
Signal's legitimate features — impersonating Signal Security Support
to steal PINs and hijack accounts, or tricking targets into scanning
QR codes that silently link attacker devices with access to 45 days of
chat history. The campaigns rely entirely on social engineering rather
than exploits, making them difficult to detect through traditional
security tooling. Users should enable Registration Lock, audit linked
devices regularly, and treat any unsolicited messages requesting
verification codes as malicious. 

 HACKTIVIST SCRAPES OVER 500K STALKERWARE CUSTOMERS' PAYMENT RECORDS
(2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A hacktivist going by the name wikkid has scraped and released over
500K customer records from stalkerware services provided by a
Ukrainian company called Struktura. The scraped data includes customer
email addresses, which app or brand the customer paid for, how much
they paid, the payment type, and the last four digits of credit card
numbers. The hacktivist stated that they exploited a “trivial bug”
in the service's website. 

 DISCORD WILL SOON REQUIRE FACE SCANS OR ID FOR ALL USERS OR RESTRICT
ACCESS (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Discord has announced that beginning in early March, users will need
to verify their age via a selfie or government ID. Users' accounts
will be set to teen accounts by default until they perform the
verification. Discord states that the selfie processing will happen
locally on users' devices, that government IDs will be deleted by
their third-party processors “quickly,” and that age verification
status will not be visible on users' profiles.
