 1PASSWORD WEBINAR: BEHIND THE SCENES OF REDDIT'S CYBERSECURITY
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 In this on-demand webinar, Nick Fohs, Sr. Manager of Enterprise
Security & Systems at Reddit, provides an inside look at how Reddit
was able to strengthen security without slowing employees down. The
key? Centralizing credential management with 1Password.  [4]

You'll learn:

 	* Why credential sprawl and shadow IT put Reddit at risk
 	* How they rolled out 1Password and drove adoption across the
enterprise
 	* The measurable improvements they saw in efficiency, compliance,
and security

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL FLAWS FOUND IN AI DEVELOPMENT TOOLS DUBBED AN 'IDESASTER'
— DATA THEFT AND REMOTE CODE EXECUTION POSSIBLE (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A six-month investigation uncovered over 30 vulnerabilities across
every major AI-integrated IDE tested, including GitHub Copilot,
Cursor, Claude Code, and JetBrains products, resulting in at least 24
assigned CVEs. The attack chain exploits prompt injection via rule
files, READMEs, or malicious MCP servers to hijack AI agents, which
then abuse legitimate IDE features like JSON schema fetching or
executable path configuration to exfiltrate data or achieve RCE.
Organizations using AI coding assistants should audit workspace
configurations, restrict AI agent permissions, and monitor for
suspicious outbound requests from development environments. 

 POPULAR AI IMAGE GENERATOR EXPOSED OVER 1M IMAGES INCLUDING DEEPFAKES
AND NUDITY FACE SWAPS (8 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler uncovered an unsecured, publicly
accessible database containing images and videos that appeared to
belong to a company named SocialBook. The database included
pornographic face swaps, deepfakes, and unaltered reference photos. It
is unclear how long the images were accessible or whether the exposure
was caused directly by SocialBook or through a third party. 

 PETCO CONFIRMS SECURITY LAPSE EXPOSED CUSTOMERS' PERSONAL DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Petco reports that a misconfigured software application briefly left
certain customer files accessible online, exposing unspecified
personal data before the issue was fixed. Details on the number of
victims and exact data types remain undisclosed, though legal
thresholds suggest that at least hundreds of customers were impacted.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HARDENING BROWSER SECURITY WITH ZERO-TRUST CONTROLS (14 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This framework outlines six principles for browser-centric zero trust
architecture: identity-first access control using federated IdPs,
least-privileged access with time-bounded entitlements, continuous
verification with adaptive policies, phishing-resistant FIDO2/WebAuthn
authentication, device health gating via MDM/EDR integration, and
remote browser isolation for high-risk sessions. Implementation
follows CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model through three
stages—starting with SSO and passkey MFA, advancing to device
compliance enforcement with SCIM automation, and achieving optimal
state with per-request access decisions and automated RBI for
privileged operations. Security teams should prioritize deploying
passkeys to administrators first, integrate IdP conditional access
with SIEM/SOAR to automate session revocation, and codify all ZTNA
policies as infrastructure-as-code for governance. 

 NEW PROMPT INJECTION ATTACK VECTORS THROUGH MCP SAMPLING (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Unit 42 researchers demonstrated three attack vectors exploiting the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) sampling feature in AI coding copilots:
resource theft through hidden prompts that consume token quotas
invisibly, conversation hijacking via persistent prompt injection that
alters LLM behavior across sessions, and covert tool invocation
enabling unauthorized file system operations without user awareness.
The attacks exploit MCP's implicit trust model, where malicious
servers can craft prompts requesting LLM completions, with responses
processed and hidden from users by the client's summarization layer.
Organizations should implement request sanitization with strict
templates, enforce capability declarations limiting server
permissions, require explicit user approval for tool executions, and
deploy statistical analysis to flag abnormal token usage patterns. 

 TANGLECRYPT: A SOPHISTICATED BUT BUGGY MALWARE PACKER (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 TangleCrypt is a previously undocumented Windows malware packer that
features complex features such as the ability to execute in its own
process or a child process based on a user-supplied string. The packer
employs several common anti-analysis techniques such as
anti-debugging, string encryption, dynamic import resolving, and
unoptimized code. There are several bugs in the packer, which suggests
that it may still be a work in progress.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SCALABLE IAM STRATEGY EXAMPLES AND WORKFLOWS TO SWIPE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 When identity breaks down, the consequences ripple across the
business. If you feel like manual IAM processes aren't keeping up with
modern demands, grab this free Tines guide [11] for a 5-step IAM
framework, practical checklist, and pre-built workflows for a more
scalable IAM strategy [11]. 

 EVILMIST (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 EvilMist's Enumerate-EntraUsers is an Azure Entra ID reconnaissance
tool featuring 15+ user enumeration methods designed to work even when
direct /users API access is blocked. It assesses MFA gaps, conditional
access policy weaknesses, and privilege escalation paths with
BloodHound-compatible export. Available in PowerShell and Python with
stealth mode (configurable delays/jitter) for detection evasion. 

 TEXT GIBBERIFIER (WEBAPP) [13] 

 A WebApp that inserts invisible Unicode characters into text to block
AIs from reading it while preserving meaning for humans. 

 HELMET SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Helmet Security provides an end-to-end security platform for agentic
AI, focused on securing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and
connections between AI agents, software, and data. It discovers MCP
endpoints, monitors and logs traffic, and blocks noncompliant or risky
AI communication paths.

 SANCTIONED SPYWARE MAKER INTELLEXA HAD DIRECT ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT
ESPIONAGE VICTIMS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers from Amnesty International and a coalition of newspapers
released a series of reports based on data from Intellexa, a company
selling spyware to governments and other clients. The leaked data
included training videos showing that Intellexa employees could
remotely access some of their customers through TeamViewer. Intellexa
denies any misconduct, asserting that it only uses TeamViewer with
client permission and supervision for technical support when issues
need fixing. 

 WHY SECURITY NEEDS TO BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF AI DEVELOPMENT (6
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Given the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, security teams need to
embed themselves in the development of agentic and other AI tools.
They should collaborate with developers and share tooling for code
analysis and agent monitoring. Security teams should also use AI-based
tools and social engineering to pentest models. 

 CLOUDFLARE FIREWALL REACTS BADLY TO REACT EXPLOIT MITIGATION (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cloudflare briefly knocked many customer sites and services offline
after a flawed Web Application Firewall update meant to block a new
remote code execution vulnerability in React Server Components. The
misconfiguration took Cloudflare's network down for several minutes,
disrupting platforms from e-commerce to cloud services and echoing
earlier large outages at Cloudflare and AWS.
