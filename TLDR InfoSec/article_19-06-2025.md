ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ANUBIS RANSOMWARE ADDS WIPER TO DESTROY FILES BEYOND RECOVERY (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Anubis ransomware-as-a-service operation added a new wiper module
to its malware that destroys targeted files, making recovery
impossible even if the ransom is paid. The new /WIPEMODE command
requires key-based authentication and then erases all file contents,
reducing the file size to 0 KB. This functionality presumably
increased Anubis' pressure on victims during negotiations. 

 'STARGAZERS' USE FAKE MINECRAFT MODS TO STEAL PLAYER PASSWORDS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Check Point Research discovered a campaign conducted by the
Stargazers Ghost Network that leverages approximately 500 different
GitHub repositories to target Minecraft players with trojanized and
malicious mods. The mods contain a JAR loader which downloads the
Java-based stealer from Pastebin. The stealer attempts to steal
Minecraft account tokens, data from popular third-party launchers, and
Discord and Telegram account tokens before acting as a loader for a
traditional info stealer which attempts to steal information from web
browsers, VPN account data, cryptocurrency wallets, etc. 

 AGENTSMITH FLAW IN LANGSMITH'S PROMPT HUB EXPOSED USER API KEYS, DATA
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Noma Security researchers discovered the "AgentSmith" vulnerability
(CVE score 8.8) in LangChain's LangSmith platform, allowing malicious
AI agents in the public Prompt Hub to steal sensitive user data,
including OpenAI API keys, through hidden proxy configurations. When
users adopted and ran these compromised agents, all their
communications and private data would be secretly intercepted through
the attacker's server in a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially
leading to unauthorized account access, data theft, and financial
losses. LangChain fixed the vulnerability on November 6, 2024, after
responsible disclosure and implemented new safety measures, including
warning messages and banners for agents with custom proxy settings.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IMPLEMENTING SIEM AND SOAR PLATFORMS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A 3-part guide to implementing SIEM and SOAR platforms for security
professionals and executives. The first part is designed for
executives and introduces the concept of SIEM and SOAR, explains how
they function, provides guidance for choosing a SIEM, and cautions
organizations on attempting to implement a SOAR before properly
implementing and testing a SIEM. The second and third parts are for
implementers. 

 GODFATHER ANDROID MALWARE RUNS REAL APPS IN A SANDBOX TO STEAL DATA
(3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers from Zimperium zLabs unveiled a new variant of the
GodFather Android malware that uses on-device virtualization to deploy
real banking and cryptocurrency apps in a controlled sandbox. This
method allows attackers to monitor and steal user credentials
stealthily, as the malware disguises itself by installing a hidden
host app that redirects users to virtualized versions of these
applications. Primarily targeting 12 Turkish financial institutions,
the malware affects 484 applications globally and employs overlays and
Android accessibility services to enhance control over devices. 

 THE ROLE OF AI AND COMPLIANCE IN MODERN RISK MANAGEMENT: SHOWMECON
2025 (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 At ShowMeCon 2025 in St. Charles, cybersecurity experts noted that
while compliance frameworks like PCI DSS provide necessary structure,
they are often treated as mere formalities rather than integral to
operational security. They stressed the importance of human oversight
in AI-driven policy creation and threat detection, acknowledging that
adversaries also use AI for more sophisticated attacks. The key
takeaway was that compliance should be a foundational step.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 REMOTE WORKERS HAVE BECOME THE WEAKEST LINK IN CYBERSECURITY CHAIN
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Hybrid teams and remote workers have completely blurred the lines of
the security perimeter, creating ample room for human error and
misuses of credentials (which together cause 85% of data breaches).
Learn how to protect your hybrid workforce while keeping everyone
productive - read the free ebook [11] or request a demo [12]. 

 TRACECAT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Tracecat is an open-source automation platform built for security and
IT engineers that uses YAML-based templates for integrations with a
no-code UI for workflows. It is designed to be a free, open-source
alternative to tools like Tines or Splunk SOAR. 

 CROSS CLOUD IDENTITIES IN ZERO TRUST POC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 This repository provides Terraform code that demonstrates how
multi-cloud federated user and workload authentication can be
utilized. 

 DARK-KILL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 A user-mode code and its rootkit that will kill EDR processes
permanently by leveraging the power of Process Creation Blocking
Kernel Callback Routine registering and ZwTerminateProcess.

 TURKEY BUSTS CHINESE SPYING RING USING FAKE CELL TOWERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Turkish intelligence announced that it caught seven suspects who
belonged to a Chinese espionage ring eavesdropping on Uyghurs and
Turkish officials. The attackers used IMSI-catcher devices to mimic
legitimate mobile phone tower signals to collect data, phone logs,
conversations, and other information from nearby phones. The attackers
funded their operations by hacking into and draining the bank accounts
of Turkish civilians. 

 A PEEK INTO AN IN-GAME AD CLIENT (8 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Jordan Whitehead delves into reversing the Anzu in-game ad client's
usage in the Trackmania racing game. First, Whitehead built a DLL
harness to enumerate the functions that Trackmania called from the
anzu.dll and iterated on it to uncover further debug information and
arguments. He then used mitmproxy to intercept network traffic and was
able to utilize this to view the JavaScript functionality that managed
targeted ads and replace ad campaigns with his own custom campaigns,
serving images from localhost. 

 GERRIT MISCONFIGURATION EXPOSED GOOGLE PROJECTS TO MALICIOUS CODE
INJECTION (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Tenable researchers discovered a misconfiguration in Google's Gerrit
code collaboration platform that could have allowed attackers to
inject malicious code into popular Google projects like ChromiumOS,
Bazel, and Dart through supply chain attacks. The vulnerability,
dubbed "GerriScary" (CVE-2025-1568), exploited improper permissions
for the addPatchSet feature and a race condition in the automated
merge process, allowing attackers to modify approved code changes
without triggering new reviews. Google fixed the issue across all
Chrome/ChromeOS-related projects after Tenable's October 2024 report,
awarded a $5,000 bug bounty, and found no evidence of prior
exploitation.

 RANSOMWARE GANG BUSTED IN THAILAND HOTEL RAID (1 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Thai police raided the Antai Holiday Hotel in Pattaya, arresting at
least 20 foreigners, including six Chinese nationals involved in a
ransomware operation targeting Chinese companies, and apprehending
around 20 individuals running an illegal gambling ring while seizing
laptops, mobile devices, and gambling equipment. 

 LINUX SECURITY: NEW FLAWS ALLOW ROOT ACCESS, CISA WARNS OF OLD BUG
EXPLOITATION (2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Qualys disclosed two new Linux vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-6018 and
CVE-2025-6019) that can be chained together to allow unprivileged
attackers to gain full root access, while CISA separately warned that
an older Linux kernel flaw (CVE-2023-0386) is being actively exploited
in the wild.
