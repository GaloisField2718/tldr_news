 FREE RESOURCES TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN IT SECURITY AND OT
ENGINEERING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your SOC team has a ransomware playbook… but your OT engineers live
in a different universe. Meanwhile, attackers exploit this gap
daily—with 45% of ICS compromises starting in IT networks before
crossing into industrial systems. At $4.73M per incident, that's an
expensive disconnect!

Learn how to bridge this gap and protect critical business
infrastructure:

📥 Download the practical OT ransomware framework [5] built for
engineers, not just security teams.

👀 Register for the webcast on May 16 [6] to watch ICS security
experts Tim Conway and Robert M. Lee discuss protection strategies.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ASCENSION REVEALS PERSONAL DATA OF 437,329 PATIENTS EXPOSED IN
CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Ascension, the second-largest private healthcare system in the US,
suffered a data breach that exposed the personal and health
information of 437,329 patients through a former partner's compromise.
In December 2024, the partner faced a security incident due to a
vulnerability in third-party software, leading to the theft of
sensitive data, including names, contact details, SSNs, and medical
visit records. This marks Ascension's second major cybersecurity
incident, following a Black Basta ransomware attack in May 2024,
prompting the company to offer affected patients two years of free
identity monitoring. 

 160,000 IMPACTED BY VALSOFT DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AllTrust (Valsoft Corporation) is notifying 160,000+ people of a
February data breach at its subsidiary, Aspire USA. Unauthorized
access occurred February 12-15, with security teams interrupting an
in-progress file transfer. Potentially compromised data includes
names, driver's licenses, Social Security numbers, and financial
details. No misuse has been reported. 

 A TIMELINE OF SOUTH KOREAN TELCO GIANT SKT'S DATA BREACH (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 SK Telecom suffered a massive cyberattack in April 2025 that
compromised the personal data of 23 million South Koreans. This
article navigates the timeline, highlighting potential losses of $5
billion if cancellation fees are waived. The malware was found in
SKT's home subscriber server.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TUTORIAL: SLIVER C2 WITH BALLISKIT MACROPACK AND SHELLCODEPACK (7
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This tutorial shows how to use BallisKit tools (ShellcodePack and
MacroPack Pro) to deploy Sliver C2 implants while evading security
measures. It demonstrates how to set up a Sliver server on Linux,
generate implant types, and weaponize them with ShellcodePack to
bypass EDRs. It also explains how to create initial access payloads
like LNK files and ClickOnce applications to deploy the obfuscated
Sliver implants on target Windows machines. 

 BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER PART I: FUZZING COREAUDIO WITH MACH
MESSAGES (23 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post explains how Google's Project Zero created a custom
fuzzing harness to identify vulnerabilities in macOS's CoreAudio
system by targeting Mach IPC messages, using a "knowledge-driven
fuzzing" approach that merges automation with reverse engineering.
Through iterative enhancements to the harness, including proper system
initialization, API call chaining for stateful operations, mocking out
problematic functionality, and refining message structures, the author
identified a type confusion vulnerability (CVE-2024-54529) in the
CoreAudio daemon. This vulnerability arose because several message
handlers did not verify object types before function calls, allowing
arbitrary code execution via crafted Mach messages sent from a
sandboxed process.

 BLUETOOTH 6.1 ENHANCES PRIVACY WITH RANDOMIZED RPA TIMING (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has announced Bluetooth
Core Specification 6.1, which includes key improvements to the
wireless communication protocol. One new feature is increased device
privacy through randomized Resolvable Private Addresses (RPA) updates.
The SIG states that varying the timing of address changes
significantly complicates third parties' ability to monitor or relate
device activities over time. 

 OPERATION MOONLANDER DISMANTLED THE BOTNET BEHIND ANYPROXY AND 5SOCKS
CYBERCRIMINALS SERVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Law enforcement dismantled a 20-year-old botnet behind Anyproxy and
5socks services, arresting four suspects, including three Russians.
The U.S. Justice Department charged them with operating illegal proxy
networks and exploiting infected routers for profit. The FBI warned
about these malicious services targeting vulnerable end-of-life
routers, urging users to replace compromised devices to prevent
cyberattacks. 

 SENATORS MOVE TO QUASH THE USE OF CHINESE AI SYSTEM BY FEDERAL
CONTRACTORS (3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A bipartisan Senate bill from Senators Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Jacky
Rosen (D-Nev.) seeks to ban federal contractors from using DeepSeek, a
Chinese-made language model whose hosted version transmits data to
China. This legislation addresses national security fears about
sensitive data access by the Chinese government while allowing
case-by-case waivers for national security or research reasons. The
bill contributes to a broader initiative to limit Chinese AI in
government, complementing a House bill prohibiting DeepSeek on
government devices and similar laws in Texas, New York, and Virginia.
