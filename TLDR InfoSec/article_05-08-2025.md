 THREATLOCKER RINGFENCING: STOP ATTACKERS FROM WEAPONIZING APPS LIKE
POWERSHELL AND EXCEL (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Why bother with malware when you can exploit legitimate applications
already on the target system? Attackers are increasingly turning
trusted tools like PowerShell, Excel, and web browsers  into attack
vectors.

ThreatLocker Ringfencing™ [4] stops this by containing applications
and limiting how they interact with each other. Even if an attacker
compromises a trusted application, Ringfencing prevents it from
accessing sensitive data or executing unauthorized commands.

You're essentially adding an extra barrier and containment layer for
your applications [5]. They can still do their jobs, but they can't be
used to move laterally through your environment.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW PLAGUE LINUX MALWARE STEALTHILY MAINTAINS SSH ACCESS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Plague is a stealthy Linux malware that had evaded detection for over
a year. It acts as a malicious PAM module, using layered obfuscation
techniques and environment tampering to avoid detection. The Plague
backdoor also scrubs the `SSH_CONNECTION` and `SSH_CLIENT` environment
variables and redirects `HISTFILE` to `/dev/null`. 

 NORTHWEST RADIOLOGISTS DATA BREACH HITS 350,000 IN WASHINGTON (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Northwest Radiologists suffered a data breach between January 20 and
25 that exposed the personal information of 350,000 Washington State
residents. Compromised data includes names, addresses, Social Security
numbers, medical records, and health insurance details. The company
has secured its systems, notified authorities, and is offering free
credit monitoring to affected individuals. 

 PYTHON-POWERED MALWARE SNAGS HUNDREDS OF CREDIT CARDS, 200K
PASSWORDS, AND 4M COOKIES (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Vietnamese cybercriminals using PXA Stealer have infected more than
4,000 victims across 62 countries, stealing 200,000 passwords, credit
card data, and 4 million browser cookies. The malware abuses
legitimate software like Microsoft Word and PDF readers for
sideloading attacks, then sells the stolen data on Telegram
marketplaces such as Sherlock.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPLOITING SELF-XSS USING DISK CACHE (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security researchers have developed a novel technique to exploit
self-XSS vulnerabilities by combining login CSRF attacks with browser
disk cache manipulation. The attack works by forcing victims to log
into attacker-controlled accounts, then using browser history
navigation (`history.go(-2)`) to access cached victim data from
previous sessions. Organizations can defend against this attack vector
by implementing `Cache-Control: no-store` headers on sensitive
endpoints to prevent disk cache exploitation. 

 OUR JOURNEY FROM FRAGILE SSH TO ZERO-TRUST CONNECTIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 A Redditor shares their journey building an open-source alternative
to tools like Vercel and Railway. Initially, users would bring their
own servers and provide keys in the UI. However, due to privacy and
security concerns, dflow added the ability to purchase servers via
AWS, along with a free promo program that was quickly abused. They
later discovered that they could use Tailscale to allow servers to
dynamically join their network with one command, or even automatically
as part of their Dockerfile, without the need to exchange SSH keys. 

 BREAKING NVIDIA TRITON: CVE-2025-23319 - A VULNERABILITY CHAIN
LEADING TO AI SERVER TAKEOVER (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Newly discovered critical vulnerabilities in NVIDIA's Triton
Inference Server allow remote attackers to gain full system control.
The flaws (CVE-2025-23319, CVE-2025-23320, and CVE-2025-23334) could
enable AI model theft, data exposure, and network infiltration. NVIDIA
has released patches, and users are advised to update to the latest
version immediately.

 INTRODUCING SRA VERIFY – AN AWS SECURITY REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE
ASSESSMENT TOOL (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 SRA Verify is an open-source security assessment tool that validates
AWS environments against the Security Reference Architecture through
automated checks across CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config, Security Hub,
and other services. The tool maps directly to AWS SRA recommendations
and helps organizations verify that their multi-account security
implementations align with AWS best practices. Teams can use the
GitHub repository for infrastructure-as-code examples to remediate
identified gaps. 

 DEPTECTIVE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Deptective is a tool that automatically determines the native
dependencies required to run any given program or command.

 APT36: A PHISHING CAMPAIGN TARGETING INDIAN GOVERNMENT ENTITIES (8
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 APT36 (Transparent Tribe), a Pakistan-linked threat group, is
conducting a sophisticated phishing campaign against Indian government
entities using typo-squatted domains that mimic official portals to
harvest credentials and bypass Kavach MFA. The operation employs
real-time OTP harvesting with C2 infrastructure hosted on Pakistani
servers and coordinated domain registrations, indicating
state-sponsored backing. Organizations should immediately block
identified IOCs, including the domains mgovcloud[.]in and
virtualeoffice[.]cloud, as well as associated IP addresses. 

 NORTH KOREA SENT ME ABROAD TO BE A SECRET IT WORKER. MY WAGES FUNDED
THE REGIME (10 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 North Korea sends thousands of IT workers abroad to secure remote
jobs at Western companies using hundreds of fake identities,
generating $250-600 million annually for the state. The workers use
stolen identities from European citizens to apply for US and European
tech jobs, often resulting in multiple North Koreans unknowingly hired
by the same company. An estimated 85% of earnings are sent back to
fund the regime. Security firms report interviewing dozens of
suspected North Korean IT workers who use AI face-swapping technology
and work from locations where it's never daytime during supposed US
business hours. 

 GENE SEQUENCING GIANT ILLUMINA SETTLES FOR $9.8M OVER PRODUCT
VULNERABILITIES (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Gene sequencing company Illumina agreed to pay $9.8 million to settle
Justice Department accusations that it sold cybersecurity-vulnerable
genomic sequencing systems to federal agencies between 2016 and 2023.
The company allegedly lacked proper security programs and falsely
claimed its software met cybersecurity standards.
