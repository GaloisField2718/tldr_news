 HOW AI DEMOCRATIZED RANSOMWARE: AKAMAI'S 2025 REPORT REVEALS $724M
TRICKBOT EXTORTION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Groups like FunkSec now use AI and LLMs to enable less technical
actors to launch sophisticated campaigns, contributing to over $724
million extorted via TrickBot malware alone.

The 2025 State of the Internet report reveals ransomware's evolution
beyond simple file encryption:

	* Quadruple extortion tactics now emerging as the newest method
	* AI-powered attacks increasing frequency and scale of campaigns
	* Hybrid hacktivist groups leveraging RaaS platforms for political
disruption
	* DDoS and compliance weaponization as new extortion tools

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EVEREST RANSOMWARE CLAIMS MAILCHIMP AS NEW VICTIM IN RELATIVELY SMALL
BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Everest ransomware group claims to have breached Mailchimp, stealing
767 MB of data containing 943,536 lines, including business
information, domain names, company emails, and technology stack
details. The leaked data appears to be structured business information
from marketing or CRM exports rather than Mailchimp's internal
systems, suggesting the breach may have targeted customer data rather
than core infrastructure. Everest follows the double extortion model
and previously breached Coca-Cola in May, though it remains a
relatively obscure ransomware strain compared to major groups. 

 APPLE PATCHES SECURITY FLAW EXPLOITED IN CHROME ZERO-DAY ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Apple patched CVE-2025-6558, a high-severity vulnerability in the
ANGLE graphics layer that was actively exploited in Chrome zero-day
attacks and allows remote code execution via malicious HTML pages.
Google's Threat Analysis Group discovered the flaw in June, with
Google patching Chrome on July 15 and CISA adding it to the Known
Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, requiring federal agencies to patch
by August 12. The vulnerability affects iOS 18.6, iPadOS 18.6, macOS
Sequoia 15.6, and other Apple platforms, marking the sixth zero-day
Apple has patched this year.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HACKERS PLANT 4G RASPBERRY PI ON BANK NETWORK IN FAILED ATM HEIST (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The UNC2891 hacking group (LightBasin) physically planted a
4G-equipped Raspberry Pi on a bank's ATM network switch to create
covert remote access into the internal network. The attackers used
this device as a pivot point to move laterally through the bank's
systems, deploying backdoors and attempting to install their Caketap
rootkit to spoof ATM authorization and steal cash. The heist
ultimately failed, but demonstrated advanced anti-forensics
techniques, including filesystem mounting to hide malicious processes
from security tools. 

 CHINA'S COVERT CAPABILITIES | SILK SPUN FROM HAFNIUM (12 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 SentinelOne's analysis of DOJ indictments revealed China's
sophisticated tiered contractor ecosystem for cyber operations.
Hafnium/Silk Typhoon operates through at least three companies
directly tasked by the Shanghai State Security Bureau rather than
opportunistic access brokers. Shanghai Firetech holds 10+ previously
unknown patents for offensive tools, including Apple device forensics,
smart home appliance control, and encrypted data
recovery—capabilities far exceeding publicly attributed Hafnium TTPs
and suggesting broader operational scope across multiple MSS regional
offices. The research exposed critical attribution gaps where threat
actor tracking focuses on behavioral clusters rather than
organizational structures, with companies potentially selling
capabilities to other MSS offices while remaining unattributed despite
shared corporate ownership. 

 BALANCING SECRECY AND TRANSPARENCY IN BUG BOUNTY PROGRAMS (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Bug bounty programs allow vendors to expand their security testing
efforts with community hackers who can receive payment for their work.
One issue with this approach is that, particularly in private
programs, vendors control the disclosure timeline and may create an
information gap. Government organizations should step in to regulate
vulnerability disclosure with NIST drafting standards and metrics for
bug bounty programs, CISA establishing a voluntary vendor
accreditation program, as well as requiring federal agencies to comply
with the standards, and the SEC to require publicly traded companies
to report their bug bounty metrics.

end-to-end encryption with cross-device syncing. The app supports easy
import/export functions for TOTP seeds (including from Google
Authenticator), automatic encrypted backups, and biometric/PIN
locking.  Unlike competing apps, it operates without ads, trackers,
or vendor lock-in. The source code will be released on GitHub within
weeks.

 CISA SAYS IT WILL RELEASE TELECOM SECURITY REPORT SOUGHT BY SEN.
WYDEN TO LIFT HOLD ON PLANKEY NOMINATION (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 CISA has committed to releasing its suppressed 2022 U.S.
Telecommunications Insecurity Report after Sen. Wyden blocked CISA
director nominee Sean Plankey's confirmation until the document is
made public. Wyden claims the report contains “shocking details”
about telecom vulnerabilities that could have prevented the Salt
Typhoon espionage campaign if released when written initially. The
Senate passed legislation requiring the report's release within 30
days, while CISA provided no timeline beyond saying it needs “proper
clearance.” 

 SHINNYHUNTERS BEHIND SALESFORCE DATA THEFT ATTACKS AT QANTAS, ALLIANZ
LIFE, AND LVMH (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google's Threat Intelligence Group has identified a wave of data
breaches as being linked to the ShinyHunters group, debunking the
belief that it was associated with ScatteredSpider. In these attacks,
the attackers impersonated IT support staff in targeted vishing calls
to persuade employees into visiting Salesforce's connected app setup
page and then entering a “connection code” that linked a malicious
version of Salesforce's Data Loader OAuth app. 

 CAREER LONGEVITY & THE DON'T FIRE ME CHART (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A common metric of security program success is how much leadership is
prepared to stick with the work over the long term. Security work
tends to follow a cycle in which security issues are increasing so the
company hires a security engineer to fix them, the engineer begins
fixing the low hanging fruit and the number of issues declines, the
engineer digs deeper and implements more logging, monitoring, etc and
discovers more issues, management wonders why the issues have
increased and fires the engineer. This can be mitigated by
communicating that the situation will get worse in the short-term
before it gets better in the long-term.
