 DATADOG'S 2024 STATE OF DEVSECOPS REPORT REVEALS WIDESPREAD USE OF
CLICKOPS FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 To what extent are organizations adopting established DevSecOps best
practices?

To answer this question, security researchers at Datadog analyzed
telemetry from tens of thousands of cloud environments [4]. Among many
interesting findings, the data revealed that:

 	* Java services are the most impacted by third-party vulnerabilities
 	* Only a small portion [4] of identified vulnerabilities are worth
prioritising
 	* Manual cloud deployments are still widespread [4]
 	* Usage of short-lived credentials in CI/CD pipelines is lower than
expected

 FAKE GOOGLE CHROME ERRORS TRICK YOU INTO RUNNING MALICIOUS POWERSHELL
SCRIPTS (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Proofpoint analysts have identified three attack chains that seek to
social engineer users into running malicious Powershell scripts. The
first two attack chains load a script hosted on Binance's chain which
shows the user a fake Google Chrome error and prompts them to
‚Äúinstall a root certificate‚Äù by copying a Powershell script into
an admin Powershell console. The third attack chain sends an email
resembling Microsoft Word documents and prompts users to install a
Word Online extension which then prompts the user to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the
document by running a Powershell script or downloading and executing a
file.

register a new runner with the ubuntu-latest tag that will be used for
any actions trying to use the GitHub hosted ubuntu-latest runner.
