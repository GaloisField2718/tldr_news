and financial details. 

 OREGON ZOO HACK IMPACTS OVER 100K (1 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Oregon Zoo disclosed a payment skimming malware attack that
exfiltrated personal and credit card data of 100K individuals over 6

 TOYOTA CONFIRMS BREACH AFTER 240GB OF STOLEN DATA LEAKS ON HACKING
FORUMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Toyota has confirmed a breach of 240GB of data but has not provided
details on what the data contains or how many people are affected by
it. The leaker claims that the data contains contacts, financials,
customers, employees, photos, DBs, network infrastructure, emails, and
more. The files were stolen or created on December 25, 2022, which
suggests that the data may have been a backup.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXECUTION GUARDRAILS: NO ONE LIKES UNINTENTIONAL EXPOSURE (8 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 A post from TrustedSec's Brandon McGrath which begins with a
discussion of an engagement where his implant got caught by a member
of the blue team. McGrath details how he uses a key ring consisting of
host based checks, network checks, and external checks as an execution
guardrail. In the example, the implant first checked the hostname of
the system, then network shares, and finally a TXT record before
downloading and launching the payload. 

 ENABLING TRUSTED TYPES IN A COMPLEX WEB APPLICATION: A CASE STUDY OF
APPSHEET (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trusted Types is a defense-in-depth mechanism that protects against
DOM XSS by implementing type systems to ensure that only safely
constructed values can reach injection sinks. To rollout Trusted Types
in AppSheet, the Google team followed a five stage process:
report-only mode, collect and triage violations, refactor blockers,
repeat the previous two steps, and enforcement. When investigating a
Trusted Types violation, a report contains the source file where the
violation occurred, the document URI which is the URI where the
violation occurred, and the script-sample which includes the
underlying API call that caused the violation and a prefix of the
input that caused the violation. 

 GITHUB ACTIONS EXPLOITATION: DEPENDABOT (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Synacktiv discovered a novel GitHub Actions exploitation technique
leveraging Dependabot to compromise repositories and push arbitrary
code. The vulnerability stems from workflows using the
'pull_request_target' event with weak access controls based on the
'github.actor' context, which can be manipulated by triggering
Dependabot actions on a forked repository. Synacktiv demonstrated
successful exploits against the spring-security and trpc projects,
highlighting the importance of careful workflow configuration and the
use of tools like octoscan for detecting such vulnerabilities.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FOR MOBILE BANKING APPS, SECURE SDKS AREN'T ENOUGH (SPONSOR) [10] 

 Banking apps are a prime target for attacks. Secure SDKs (e.g. for
KYC or payments) are good, but they can create a false sense of
security and leave unaddressed vulnerabilities. Learn how to protect
mobile bank apps [11] against real-world threat scenarios using a
multi-layered approach [11] that includes obfuscation, encryption, and
real-time application self-protection (RASP). Join the live session
with Guardsquare [11] 

 LINX SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Linx uses analytics and AI to scan and understand the landscape of an
organization's system to link all identities together and to actual,
active employees. In the process, it also finds IDs that are no longer
connected to active users so that they can be removed. 

 GRAPHQLER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 GraphQLer is a dependency-aware API fuzzer that uses relationships
between objects and mutations to inform its testing 

 GRIMOIRE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Grimoire is a tool that generates datasets of cloud audit logs for
detection engineering. The tool currently supports the ability to
detonate Stratus Red Team or AWS CLI commands and stream the
CloudTrail logs to an output file.

 NATIONAL PUBLIC DATA PUBLISHED ITS OWN PASSWORDS (5 MINUTE READ) [15]


 KrebsOnSecurity learned that another NPD data broker which shares
access to the same consumer records - recordscheck.net ‚Äî was hosting
an archive that included the usernames and passwords of the site's
administrator. 

 MICROSOFT SAYS ALL AZURE SIGN-INS WILL NOW NEED TO USE MULTI-FACTOR
AUTHENTICATION TO ENHANCE ACCOUNT SECURITY (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft will soon require multi-factor authentication for all Azure
sign-ins to enhance account security. The rollout will happen in two
phases, first for the Azure portal and admin centers, then for Azure
CLI, PowerShell, and other tools. 

 POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY: WHAT COMES NEXT? (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In the wake of NIST releasing the first set of post-quantum
cryptography standards, the UK's NCSC has started a series of posts on
how organizations should respond. Implementations and protocols like
TLS still need to be updated to make use of post-quantum cryptography
which will likely take years. NCSC advises that the key actions that
organizations can take now are to inventory the use of cryptography in
their own environments and in their supply chains.
