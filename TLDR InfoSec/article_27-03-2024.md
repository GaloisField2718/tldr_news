ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AWS FIXES 1-CLICK APACHE AIRFLOW SESSION HIJACK (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 AWS fixed a flaw in its Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)
service that allowed attackers to hijack MWAA sessions via an XSS
attack on AWS-hosted sites. This vulnerability was possible because
many AWS services utilize the same domain suffix, so browser cookie
protections fail. AWS and Microsoft (which had similar issues) have
registered domains associated with various vulnerable services to the
Public Suffix List to prevent these attacks. 

 GERMANY WARNS OF 17K VULNERABLE MICROSOFT EXCHANGE SERVERS EXPOSED
ONLINE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The German national cybersecurity authority has identified
approximately 17,000 Microsoft Exchange servers in Germany that are
exposed online and vulnerable to critical security flaws. Around
45,000 Exchange servers in Germany have Outlook Web Access enabled,
with some still using outdated versions of Exchange that have not
received security updates. 

 OVER 170K USERS AFFECTED BY ATTACK USING FAKE PYTHON INFRASTRUCTURE
(9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post reports on a sophisticated cyber attack campaign that
affected over 170,000 users by using fake Python infrastructure. The
attackers employed various tactics such as account takeovers,
contributing malicious code, setting up a custom Python mirror, and
publishing malicious packages to the PyPi registry. They also hijacked
GitHub accounts, published malicious Python packages, and used social
engineering schemes.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WISHING: WEBHOOKS PHISHING IN TEAMS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article presents a rundown of methods to phish users via
Microsoft Teams. By default, any user can install a new Incoming
Webhook - Microsoft provides no way to add authentication to webhooks.
An attacker can leverage this to send phishing messages to channels
that look like legitimate messages from connected applications. Teams
also supports a channel email feature which enables the same
capabilities via a unique email address per channel. 

 THE DARKSIDE OF THEMOON (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post discusses a multi-year campaign that targeted
end-of-life small home/small office routers and IoT devices with an
updated version of the TheMoon malware. The malware is associated with
a proxy service called Faceless, used by cybercriminals for anonymity.
The post also describes the global telemetry analysis of Faceless, its
proxy server infrastructure, and the behavior of infected devices in
the network. 

 BLAZE'S SECURITY BLOG: ANALYZE, HUNT, AND CLASSIFY MALWARE USING .NET
METADATA (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post discusses the development of Yara rules for
identifying and classifying malware written in .NET based on unique
identifiers such as MVID and Typelib. The author mentions tools like
GetNetGUIDs for extracting GUID types and clustering malware samples
to identify patterns. The tools and Yara rules presented can be used
to enhance existing rule sets, classify malware, and extract metadata
from .NET assemblies.

 RECENT ‚ÄòMFA BOMBING‚Äô ATTACKS TARGETING APPLE USERS (7 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Apple users have recently been targeted in phishing attacks where
scammers exploit a bug in Apple's password reset feature. The attack
inundates target devices with system prompts that must be approved or
declined repeatedly. The scammers then call the victims posing as
Apple support to obtain one-time codes for account resets. 

 FREE VPN APPS ON GOOGLE PLAY TURNED ANDROID PHONES INTO PROXIES (4
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Over 15 free VPN apps on Google Play were discovered using a
malicious software development kit that turned Android devices into
residential proxies, potentially for cybercrime. These residential
proxies route internet traffic through homes to make it appear
legitimate. Google removed apps using the LumiApps SDK from the Play
Store and updated Google Play Protect to detect the libraries used in
the apps.
