ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL VULNERABILITY IN IBM API CONNECT COULD ALLOW AUTHENTICATION
BYPASS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 IBM has disclosed CVE-2025-13915, a critical authentication bypass
vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 affecting API Connect versions
10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5 and 10.0.11.0, that allows remote attackers
to gain unauthorized access without user interaction. The flaw,
classified as CWE-305, breaks the architectural assumption that API
gateways enforce identity and trust, causing downstream services to
inherit unvalidated trust and enabling silent exposure propagation
across connected systems. Organizations should immediately apply IBM's
interim fixes or disable self-service sign-up on the Developer Portal
while conducting inventory assessments of API dependencies and
monitoring for abnormal behavior to identify which services implicitly
trust the gateway. 

 TOKYO FM DATA BREACH: HACKER CLAIMS OVER 3 MILLION RECORDS STOLEN (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A threat actor using the alias "victim" claimed to have breached
Tokyo FM Broadcasting Co., LTD. on January 1, allegedly exfiltrating
over 3 million records containing names, email addresses, dates of
birth, IP addresses, user agents, job-related information, and login
IDs from multiple internal systems. The breach claims remain pending
verification by security experts, though if validated, the exposed
credentials and personal information pose significant risks for
phishing attacks and credential stuffing. Potentially affected
listeners should monitor their email for suspicious messages,
implement unique passwords across services, and exercise heightened
vigilance given the scope of compromised personally identifiable
information. 

 BLUETOOTH HEADPHONE JACKING: FULL DISCLOSURE OF AIROHA RACE
VULNERABILITIES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers discovered a series of vulnerabilities in the Airoha
Bluetooth SoCs used in many true wireless earbuds, including those
from Sony, Bose, and Marshall. The vulnerabilities include a lack of
authentication when connecting a device over Bluetooth Classic or BLE,
as well as the devices implementing a custom protocol, called RACE,
which allows for reading and writing RAM. An attacker could chain
these vulnerabilities to impersonate a user's headphones and then
issue commands via a device's virtual assistant or eavesdrop on calls.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE ROI PROBLEM IN ATTACK SURFACE MANAGEMENT (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attack Surface Management programs struggle to demonstrate ROI
because they optimize for coverage metrics like asset counts and
alerts generated rather than measuring actual risk reduction, creating
a gap between effort and security outcomes. Traditional ASM
implementations focus on discovery inputs while teams experience alert
fatigue, long backlogs of unresolved assets, ownership confusion, and
exposures that persist for months without clear evidence of improved
security posture. Organizations should shift to outcome-based metrics,
including mean time to asset ownership, reduction in unauthenticated
state-changing endpoints, and time to decommission abandoned
assets—measurements that directly correlate with exposure duration
and demonstrate whether the attack surface is actually shrinking over
time. 

 PALO ALTO NETWORKS SECURITY-INTEL BOSS CALLS AI AGENTS 2026'S BIGGEST
INSIDER THREAT (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 AI agents are increasingly embedded deep within corporate systems,
automating tasks such as code review, alert triage, approvals, and
even financial decisions, effectively acting with human-like
privileges at machine speed. This makes misconfigurations and
over-permissive “superuser” access especially dangerous, because a
single prompt injection or tool-misuse bug can turn an agent into a
silent insider capable of approving fraudulent transactions,
exfiltrating data, or deleting backups. At the same time, these tools
help defenders scale, triage noise, and think more strategically, so
security leaders must strike a balance: apply least-privilege access,
robust monitoring, and strong controls around internal LLMs and
task-specific agents to harness benefits without enabling catastrophic
abuse. 

 PETLIBRO: YOUR PET FEEDER IS FEEDING DATA TO ANYONE WHO ASKS (9
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Smart pet feeders from Petlibro had several serious security flaws
that allowed attackers to log in to any account via a broken
social-login flow, because the backend trusted client-supplied Google
IDs rather than validating OAuth tokens. Attackers could then pull
detailed pet profiles, enumerate devices, hijack feeders and cameras,
and even harvest owners' recorded mealtime audio messages through
poorly authorized APIs. The researcher disclosed six issues, received
a small bounty and a post‑hoc NDA request, and criticized Petlibro
for leaving the legacy authentication bypass live for weeks in the
name of “compatibility” despite the risk to users and their pets.

 TWO US CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS PLEAD GUILTY IN BLACKCAT/ALPHV
RANSOMWARE CASE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cybersecurity professionals Ryan Goldberg (former Sygnia incident
response manager) and Kevin Martin (DigitalMint ransomware negotiator)
pleaded guilty to deploying BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware against multiple
US victims from April to December 2023, extorting approximately $1.2M
in Bitcoin from a medical device company while sharing 20% of ransoms
with operators. The defendants leveraged their cybersecurity expertise
to conduct attacks against five companies, with Goldberg later fleeing
to Paris after learning of FBI raids on co-conspirators and both
facing potential 50-year sentences. The case highlights insider threat
risks and the FBI's recommendation for organizations to exercise due
diligence when engaging third-party incident response providers. 

 ON APPLES, ORANGES, AND CLASSICAL ML VERSUS LLM SECURITY PERFORMANCE
(4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 When classical ML-based security tools are compared against LLM-based
security tools, the classical ML tools often have several advantages
that skew the results. Classical ML tools are frequently trained on a
portion of the dataset and then tested on the same data, whereas LLM
tools are tested in a one-shot fashion. The ground truth may contain
labeling errors that classical ML models replicate, and classical ML
models require continuous retraining to maintain accuracy. Moving
forward, we should develop security-focused foundational models to
help overcome scalability issues and hallucinations. 

 PREDICTION: AI WILL MAKE FORMAL VERIFICATION GO MAINSTREAM (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 Formal verification is a highly specialized and time-consuming
process of mathematically validating a system's behavior. The
8,700-line seL4 microkernel required 20 person-years and 200,000 lines
of code in the Isabelle proof language, underscoring why formal
verification remains largely an academic discipline at present. If we
instead train users to write proper specifications for formal
verification, it may be possible to use LLMs to generate proofs and
reduce the barrier to formal verification.
