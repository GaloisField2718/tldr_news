ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 IPROOV DISCOVERS MAJOR DARK WEB IDENTITY SCAM (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Researchers have uncovered a dark web operation involved in
collecting facial ID images and government-issued identity documents.
The threat actor bypasses Know Your Customer (KYC) identity
verification systems using these biometrics. iProov recommends the use
of multi-layered verification systems to defend against these threats.


 OVER 4,000 ISP IPS TARGETED IN BRUTE-FORCE ATTACKS TO DEPLOY INFO
STEALERS AND CRYPTOMINERS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cybercriminals have targeted Internet service providers through a
campaign involving information stealers, cryptocurrency miners, and
data exfiltration tools. These brute-force attacks aim to compromise
systems, disable security features, steal cryptocurrency, and deploy
malware. 

 RANSOMWARE GANGS EXPLOIT PARAGON PARTITION MANAGER BUG IN BYOVD
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft discovered five Paragon Partition Manager BioNTdrv.sys
driver flaws, one of which was actively used by ransomware gangs in
zero-day attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges in Windows. The drivers are
signed by Microsoft, so they can also be used in Bring Your Own
Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) attacks. Microsoft recommends enabling the
Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist to prevent BYOVD attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 JIGSAW RDPUZZLE: PIECING ATTACKER ACTIONS TOGETHER (7 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 German IT firm ERNW observed that an attacker compromised a customer
who acted as a service provider that used RDP to connect to its
customers' machines. ERNW extracted the Bitmap cache files from the
RDP server to partially reconstruct the attacker's RDP sessions
utilizing open-source tools. The post features screenshots displaying
some of the images that ERNW managed to reconstruct. 

 SOAPY: STEALTHY ENUMERATION OF ACTIVE DIRECTORY ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH
ADWS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Active Directory Web Services (ADWS) is a default-enabled service on
Active Directory domain controllers that allows clients to interact
with the local LDAP service using SOAP messages without requiring user
authentication. A group of interns from X-Force Red implemented the
protocol stack in a tool and Python library named SoaPy. Before this,
interactions with ADWS were limited to Microsoft or .NET tools,
restricting protocol usage to Windows hosts. 

 HOW WE ESTIMATE THE RISK FROM PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS ON AI SYSTEMS
(5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google DeepMind's AI security Team has developed an evaluation
framework to test an AI system's susceptibility to indirect prompt
injection attacks. The framework employs a hypothetical scenario where
an AI agent receives a fictitious email conversation. It uses three
prompt injection methods: actor-critic, where a model generates and
refines injections based on success probability; beam search; and Tree
of Attacks with Pruning, which aims to make the AI violate safety
protocols.
