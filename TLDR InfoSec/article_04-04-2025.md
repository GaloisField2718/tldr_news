ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GOOGLE PATCHES QUICK SHARE VULNERABILITY ENABLING SILENT FILE
TRANSFERS WITHOUT CONSENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A vulnerability in Google's Quick Share (CVE-2024-10668) for Windows
permitted unauthorized file transfers. The flaw, fixed in version
1.0.2002.2, could be exploited to bypass security and cause
denial-of-service attacks. 

 AI IMAGE SITE GENNOMIS EXPOSED 47GB OF UNDERAGE DEEPFAKES (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 A data leak at GenNomis, an AI image site, exposed explicit deepfake
material, including images of minors and celebrities. This incident
raises concerns about unmonitored AI-generated content and underlines
the need for improved security measures and responsible AI
development. Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler emphasized the
importance of detecting and preventing harmful deepfakes. 

 SECURITY FLAW FOUND IN UNITREE GO1 ROBOT DOGS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers at the Berlin-based security startup thinkAwesome GmbH
discovered a vulnerability in Unitree Go1 robot dogs. The robots
include a service called CloudSail, which is a remote access tunnel
service that was preinstalled on the devices. The researchers
discovered that anyone with the default credentials and a specific API
key could remotely control the robots and access their cameras.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PART 3 CODE INJECTION : HOW TO DETECT IT AND FINDING EVIL IN MEMORY
WITH MEMPROCFS FINDEVIL PLUGIN (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers use advanced techniques, such as memory manipulation, to
evade detection via code injection. Tools like Volatility and
MemProcFS help spot memory structure inconsistencies indicating
malicious activity. Security professionals can identify indications of
code injection and process manipulation by analyzing memory
permissions and DLL loading behaviors. 

 SURGE IN PALO ALTO NETWORKS SCANNER ACTIVITY INDICATES POSSIBLE
UPCOMING THREATS (3 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 There has been a surge in login scanning for Palo Alto Networks
PAN-OS GlobalProtect portals, with about 24,000 unique IPs attempting
access in the last 30 days. This coordinated effort may indicate a
plan to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. Organizations should
secure their login portals. The primary sources are the United States
and Canada, reflecting patterns from a past espionage campaign
targeting network devices and highlighting the need to monitor and
secure critical systems. 

 UNDERSTANDING RCPS AND SCPS IN AWS: CHOOSING THE RIGHT POLICY FOR
YOUR SECURITY NEEDS (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Resource Control Policies (RCPs) were introduced by AWS in late 2024
to restrict access to resources within your AWS organization. RCPs
should be used when trying to enforce consistent security standards in
supported services, you're running out of SCPs, or you want to use the
NotResource condition. SCPs should be used when you want to apply a
policy to services that are not supported by RCPs or use the NotAction
condition.

 WHAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE INDUSTRY'S LARGEST REPOSITORY OF SAAS
BREACHES (SPONSOR) [13] 

 SaaS breaches surged 300% last year, with attackers breaching core
systems in as little as 9 minutes. The 2025 SaaS Security Threat
Report by Obsidian Security [14] draws from the largest SaaS breach
data repository and direct involvement in +150 incidents, revealing
important past trends - and what to watch out for in the future. Read
the report [13] 

 SOLARWINDS LAUNCHES INCIDENT RESPONSE TOOL, BOOSTS AI IN
OBSERVABILITY PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) [15]

 LEGACY STRIPE API EXPLOITED TO VALIDATE STOLEN PAYMENT CARDS IN WEB
SKIMMER CAMPAIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Threat hunters have uncovered a web skimmer campaign that exploits
Stripe's legacy API to validate stolen payment cards for attackers.
The attackers target merchants by hiding the legitimate payment form
and cloning buttons to efficiently steal card data. This operation
uses malicious scripts on compromised sites and tailors the skimmer
payload to each target. 

 MICROSOFT'S AI TOOL CATCHES CRITICAL GRUB2, U-BOOT BOOTLOADER FLAWS
(4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Microsoft's AI tool has detected critical vulnerabilities in
bootloaders like GRUB2 and U-boot that enable attackers to bypass
Secure Boot and deploy persistent malware. These flaws significantly
threaten enterprises, allowing malware to survive OS reinstallation.
Organizations must prioritize patching affected systems and improving
firmware and bootloader updates.
