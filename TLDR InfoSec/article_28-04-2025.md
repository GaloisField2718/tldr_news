ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PLANET TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIAL SWITCH FLAWS RISK FULL TAKEOVER –
PATCH NOW (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities have been identified in Planet
Technology's industrial switches. CVE-2025-46275 and CVE-2025-46271
allow complete control of the router, while CVE-2025-46273 reveals
hard-coded communication credentials between the NMS and managed
devices, enabling remote interception and configuration changes. There
are also vulnerabilities affecting specific switches. Researchers also
found lax security practices, including the use of default or weak
credentials for MQTT and MongoDB. 

 SAP ZERO-DAY VULNERABILITY UNDER WIDESPREAD ACTIVE EXPLOITATION (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SAP Netweaver software has an unrestricted file upload vulnerability
identified by CVE-2025-31324. After querying internet server search
engines Shodan and Censys, Onapsis estimates that about 10,000 SAP
instances are potentially vulnerable. It is a CVSS 10 vulnerability,
remotely exploitable through HTTP unauthenticated, that allows for
complete system compromise. 

 NOVEL UNIVERSAL BYPASS FOR ALL MAJOR LLMS (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A new technique called "Policy Puppetry” can bypass safety
guardrails in all major generative AI models. The attack involves
crafting prompts that appear as policy files, tricking AI systems into
interpreting them as instructions that override safety alignments.
This universal vulnerability demonstrates fundamental flaws in AI
model training and security.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CROSS-SITE WEBSOCKET HIJACKING EXPLOITATION IN 2025 (9 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking is a vulnerability that arises from
WebSockets being unprotected by the Same Origin Policy, allowing
malicious sites to connect to targeted sites impersonating the user.
Modern browsers have implemented security features that make CSWSH
harder to exploit, such as Chrome's SameSite=Lax default cookie and
Firefox's Total Cookie Protection. However, proper Origin validation
during the server-side WebSocket handshake is the most reliable
defense, as browser settings can change, and Chrome still permits
CSWSH under certain conditions. 

 USING AI TO ANALYSE CYBER INCIDENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post shows how to use AI to create a timeline of the April 2025
Marks & Spencer cybersecurity incident, which impacted contactless
payments and click-and-collect services, ultimately escalating to a
suspension of online orders by April 25. The timeline details the
progression from initial reports on April 19th to April 26th,
documenting customer experiences, official communications, and media
coverage with timestamps. Although M&S has not confirmed the nature of
the attack, the company's response involved taking processes offline
and consulting cybersecurity experts, causing operational disruptions
across over 1,000 stores and a temporary 5% drop in their share price.


 IO_URING IS BACK, THIS TIME AS A ROOTKIT (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 ARMO researchers exposed a critical security gap where Linux runtime
security tools fail to detect malware using the io_uring interface.
Their proof-of-concept rootkit, "Curing," bypasses traditional system
call monitoring, affecting tools such as Falco and Microsoft Defender.
While some vendors have implemented fixes, most security solutions
remain vulnerable to this evasion technique.

 SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES TARGETED BY LAZARUS VIA WATERING HOLE ATTACKS,
ZERO-DAYS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 North Korean APT Lazarus targeted six South Korean organizations in
finance, IT, semiconductors, software, and telecommunications through
Operation SyncHole. They employed watering hole attacks and exploited
zero-day vulnerabilities in security software, targeting Cross EX and
Innorix Agent for online banking and government sites. The attack
utilized malware such as ThreatNeedle, wAgent, SignBT, and CopperHedge
for reconnaissance and access maintenance, while Lazarus further
developed tools to evade detection. 

 “YOU WOULDN'T STEAL A CAR” ANTI-PIRACY CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE USED
PIRATED FONTS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The anti-piracy campaign "You Wouldn't Steal a Car" appears to have
used XBand Rough, a knockoff of the FF Confidential font. This ironic
discovery highlights the complex nature of typeface copyright law,
where typeface designs have limited protection but font files can be
copyrighted as software. 

 NORTH KOREAN IT WORKERS SEEN USING AI TOOLS TO SCAM FIRMS INTO HIRING
THEM (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 In coordination with US authorities and third parties, Okta has
tracked the behaviors and usage of GenAI by DPRK workers. Okta found
that North Korean workers are utilizing GenAI tools at all stages in
the process, from drafting resumes, to deepfake interviews, and even
utilizing GenAI to maintain multiple jobs at the same time.
