STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BREAKING AMSI: HOW MALWARE AVOIDS WINDOWS SCRIPT SCANNING (7 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AMSI is a Windows component that serves as a middleman to pass
consumer content to a security solution such as Crowstrike or
Microsoft Defender. The first method that is discussed in the post is
to patch the prologue of the security provider's DLL to disrupt AMSI
initialization. The second method is to intercept the AMSCI scan
process by looping through the list of scan functions provided by the
providers in CAmsiAntimalware and patching their scan functions to
return immediately. 

 THE ART OF LINUX KERNEL ROOTKITS (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This comprehensive guide to Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) rootkits
begins by introducing how modern rootkits work and the different
hooking techniques used. The guide then explains detection techniques
utilizing the filesystem, proofs, logs, and eBPF Tracepoints. Finally,
the guide concludes with some advanced techniques for defenders to
expose or render rootkits useless as well as some advanced techniques
for attackers to establish persistence or defend against LKM rootkits
hunters. 

 SIGNALS OF TROUBLE: MULTIPLE RUSSIA-ALIGNED THREAT ACTORS ACTIVELY
TARGETING SIGNAL MESSENGER (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has discovered that
Russian-aligned threat actors are targeting Signal Messenger through

 CAN AI ACTUALLY FIND REAL SECURITY BUGS? TESTING THE NEW WAVE OF AI
MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The author of ai-security-analyzer decided to test the new generation
of reasoning LLMs for their ability to detect vulnerabilities in a
test project. A comparison of OpenAI o1, o3-mini-high, Gemini 2.0
