ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GITLAB PATCHES HIGH SEVERITY ACCOUNT TAKEOVER AND MISSING AUTH ISSUES
(2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 GitLab has released patches that fix critical security issues for its
Community and Enterprise versions. It fixed an HTML injection
vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to take over accounts
by injecting malicious code into the search page. GitLab also patched
a missing authorization issue that could allow remote threat actors to
inject malicious CI/CD jobs into any project's future CI/CD pipelines
in GitLab Ultimate EE servers. 

 PASSWORD-SPRAYING ATTACKS TARGET 80K MICROSOFT ENTRA ID ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers at Proofpoint are warning of a password-spraying attack
targeting Microsoft Entra ID accounts by a threat actor called
UNK_SneakyStrike. The researchers said the peak of the activity
occurred on January 8, when 16.5K accounts were targeted in a single
day, but the attacks have continued in short bursts since then.
Proofpoint identified that the attackers were using the TeamFiltration
pentesting framework based on a unique user agent that it uses and
other artifacts. 

 'MAJOR COMPROMISE' AT NHS TEMPING ARM EXPOSED GAPING SECURITY HOLES
(5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 NHS Professionals, which provides temporary staff to NHS trusts,
suffered a cyberattack in May 2024 when criminals stole its Active
Directory database containing user credentials. Despite claiming no
data was compromised, internal reports confirm the theft. The
organization lacked proper security measures like multi-factor
authentication and endpoint detection systems.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT MODELLING CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS IN 2025 (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post examines the threats posed by government pressure on cloud
service providers. The simplest attack vector is for the government to
force a cloud provider to deplatform an organization, resulting in a
denial of service. Another vector involves the government violating
confidentiality by compelling the provider to release sensitive
information. This risk can be mitigated by storing critical data
on-premises or using confidential computing architecture. 

 MISBEHAVING MODALITIES: DETECTING TOOLS, NOT TECHNIQUES (14 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Execution Modality is a detection engineering technique that
describes how a malicious behavior is executed rather than what the
malicious behavior does. Detecting Execution Modality shifts detection
closer to the operating system source of truth to create a
technique-agnostic detection while preserving necessary context. Given
this, Kernel Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) should be considered
superior to user-mode ntdll hooking. 

 “LOCALHOST TRACKING” EXPLAINED. IT COULD COST META 32 BILLION (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Meta developed "localhost tracking" to bypass Android's security
protections and identify users despite VPNs, incognito mode, and
deleted cookies. This post dives into how it works. Meta now faces
potential record fines under GDPR, DSA, and DMA regulations totaling
up to €32 billion (20% of its €164 billion revenue), as penalties
can be applied cumulatively across different violated regulations.

 Recent cyberattacks on major retailers are disrupting shopping
experiences. United Natural Foods' breach affected Whole Foods' supply
