 THE DARK SIDE OF AI: 2.6MM UNDERGROUND MESSAGES ANALYZED (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Flashpoint just released a massive study of the AI threat landscape.
Analysts monitored over 2.6 MILLION AI-RELATED POSTS across Telegram,
the dark web, and underground LLM forums.

The findings are a wake-up call [4]. Threat actors are no longer just
"experimenting" — they are deploying:

 	* DEEPFAKE-AS-A-SERVICE for sophisticated social engineering.
 	* MULTILINGUAL PHISHING KITS that erase language barriers.
 	* FRAUD-GPTS: Custom LLMs fine-tuned specifically for malicious
activity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 US BROADBAND PROVIDER BRIGHTSPEED INVESTIGATES BREACH CLAIMS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Brightspeed, a major fiber broadband provider in the US, is probing
claims by the Crimson Collective extortion gang that it stole data on
over 1 million customers, including PII, account information, and
limited payment details. The company has confirmed an ongoing
cybersecurity investigation and promises updates to customers,
employees, and authorities. 

 SEDGWICK CONFIRMS CYBERATTACK ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIARY (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Sedgwick says a ransomware-linked cyberattack hit an isolated file
transfer system at its Sedgwick Government Solutions unit, which
serves US agencies such as DHS and CISA. The firm reports no evidence
of access to claims management servers or broader network impact and
continues operations while law enforcement and clients are notified. 

 VSCODE IDE FORKS EXPOSE USERS TO “RECOMMENDED EXTENSION” ATTACKS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AI-powered IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf have been exposing users
to additional risk by recommending non-existent extensions in the
OpenVSX registry. These IDEs are forked from Microsoft VSCode, but
cannot use extensions from the official store. However, they are
supported by OpenVSX. Researchers from Koi have discovered several
recommended extensions that are not available in the OpenVSX
marketplace and are vulnerable to attackers claiming namespaces to
deliver malicious extensions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CYBERSECURITY SKILLS MATTER MORE THAN HEADCOUNT IN THE AI ERA (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ISC2's 2025 Cybersecurity Workforce Study revealed that skills gaps
have overtaken headcount as the primary concern, with 95% of 16,029
surveyed professionals reporting at least one skill need and 59%
citing critical or significant gaps—increases of 5% and 15%
respectively from 2024. Nearly 90% of respondents experienced at least
one significant cybersecurity event due to skills shortages, while AI
adoption accelerated rapidly, with 28% already integrating AI tools
and 69% actively involved in adoption. AI and cloud security were
identified as the top critical skills needs at 41% and 36%.
Organizations should prioritize capability development over headcount
expansion through sustained AI upskilling investments and realistic
workload management, as 48% of professionals feel exhausted staying
current with threats, while 75% plan to remain with their current
employer for one year, but only 66% for two years. 

 THE KIMWOLF BOTNET IS STALKING YOUR LOCAL NETWORK (14 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 The Kimwolf botnet infected over 2 million devices worldwide by using
residential proxy networks (mainly IPIDEA) to bypass firewalls and
directly access devices on internal networks. Two-thirds of these
infections came from unsanctioned Android TV boxes sold on major
e-commerce platforms, which ship with Android Debug Bridge mode
enabled by default. RIT researcher Benjamin Brundage found that
attackers exploited a vulnerability allowing DNS records to point to
RFC-1918 internal addresses, bypassing domain restrictions and
deploying malware on devices behind routers once thought to be secure.
In response, IPIDEA released security patches to block internal
network access and high-risk ports after receiving Brundage's December
2025 vulnerability report. Users should remove vulnerable Android TV
boxes, set up guest Wi-Fi for visitors, and understand that
traditional LAN security measures are now dangerously outdated. 

 REGISTRY WRITES WITHOUT REGISTRY CALLBACKS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Windows supports mandatory user profiles using an NTUSER.MAN hive
file, which, when present in a user's profile, completely replaces the
normal NTUSER.DAT hive for HKEY_CURRENT_USER during logon. By crafting
and dropping a modified NTUSER.MAN that includes persistence keys, an
attacker can ensure those keys are loaded into the user's registry
hive without using standard registry APIs, thereby sidestepping EDR
products that rely on CmRegisterCallbackEx telemetry. This technique
only requires medium-integrity access, works well with roaming or
AD-based mandatory profiles, and is primarily detectable through
filesystem events and unusual .MAN files or profilePath changes rather
than registry logs.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DBGNEXUM (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DbgNexum is a Proof-of-Concept for injecting shellcode using the
Windows Debugging API and Shared Memory (File Mapping). It avoids
writing and reading remote memory directly, instead using context
manipulation to force the target process to load and execute the
payload itself. 

 SCALEKIT (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Scalekit provides a modular authentication stack for AI and SaaS
apps, securing AI agents and human users with OAuth 2.1, token vaults,
and secure tool-calling so agents can safely act in external apps like
Gmail, Slack, and Notion. 

 SOCIAL ANALYZER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Social Analyzer is an API, CLI, and Web App for analyzing and finding
a person's profile across over 1,000 social media/websites. It
includes different analysis and detection modules, and you can choose
which modules to use during the investigation process.

 TRANSPARENT TRIBE LAUNCHES NEW RAT ATTACKS AGAINST INDIAN GOVERNMENT
AND ACADEMIA (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Transparent Tribe (APT36) deployed remote access trojans against
Indian governmental, academic, and strategic entities through
spear-phishing emails containing weaponized LNK files disguised as
PDFs that execute remote HTA scripts via mshta.exe to deliver the
final RAT payload. The malware employs adaptive persistence mechanisms
based on detected antivirus solutions, with the deployed DLL
supporting remote system control, file management, data exfiltration,
screenshot capture, and clipboard manipulation capabilities. The
campaign demonstrates Transparent Tribe's continuous toolkit
evolution, with related activity linking the group to Patchwork APT
and the new StreamSpy trojan that uses WebSocket channels for C2
communication to evade HTTP traffic detection. 

 HACKTIVIST DELETES WHITE SUPREMACIST WEBSITES LIVE ONSTAGE DURING
HACKER CONFERENCE (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 At the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, hacktivist Martha
Root live‑deleted three white supremacist platforms - WhiteDate,
WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal - after infiltrating them using AI chatbots
that passed their racist verification checks. The stunt wiped the
sites' servers, exposed serious security lapses and user data
patterns, and sparked debate as the outraged administrator decried
“cyberterrorism” while activists framed the action as a direct
anti‑racist intervention. 

 THE SINS OF SECURITY VENDOR RESEARCH (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Security vendors often provide valuable research, but also commit
“sins” that diminish the value of the research. Security vendors
often emphasize fear, uncertainty, and doubt by overdramatizing a risk
and then suggesting that the only solution is their product, or
ignoring prior research to imply a false sense of novelty for their
product. Other research sins may involve statistical sins, such as
drawing causations from mere correlation and allowing marketing to
pollute the research.
