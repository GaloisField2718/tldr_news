WILL YOUR PAYMENT WEB PAGES BE PCI DSS 4 COMPLIANT BY THE MARCH 31
DEADLINE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

95% of websites contain JavaScript and trackers, many of which
excessively collect private information from your visitors. This can
make your website non-compliant with the new PCI DSS 4 Requirements
6.4.3 and 11.6.1, exposing you to possible risks such as fines, voided
insurance coverage, and costly litigation.
Feroot PCI PaymentGuard [5] platform enables you to easily achieve PCI
DSS 4 compliance with Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 and secure all
payment web pages.

 	* Automatically detect and block unwanted trackers, malicious
scripts, and data exfiltration attempts
 	* Stay ahead of evolving threats like Magecart attacks
 	* Maintain continuous compliance with PCI DSS 4, HIPAA, CCPA, GDPR,
and other regulations

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DEEPSEEK HALTS NEW SIGNUPS AMID “LARGE-SCALE” CYBERATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Chinese AI platform DeepSeek disabled registration on its DeepSeek-V3
chat platform due to an ongoing attack. It is believed that the
company is facing a DDoS attack against its API and Web Chat
platforms. Users can still sign in with Google to the platform. 

 ZERO-CLICK OLE RCE IMPACTS MICROSOFT OUTLOOK (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Microsoft has patched a critical vulnerability in Windows Object
Linking and Embedding (OLE) caused by a double-free in ole32.dll. An
attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code by
sending a malicious RTF file, which is previewed by a victim in
Microsoft Outlook. This post includes PoC code and threat hunting
queries for the vulnerability. 

 BREAKING THE APPLE M3 CPU VIA FALSE LOAD OUTPUT PREDICTIONS (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Researchers at Georgia Tech have discovered SLAP and FLOP attacks
that exploit microarchitecture features in Apple CPUs to read
sensitive data from webpages. These attacks involve predicting memory
access patterns and tricking the CPU into operating on incorrect data
values. SLAP and FLOP will be presented at upcoming security
conferences to showcase the potential risks posed by these exploits.

 TIPS FOR INVESTIGATING CYBERCRIME INFRASTRUCTURE (4 MINUTE READ) [12]


 This author investigated cybercrime infrastructure by analyzing a FUD
Crypter service and related websites and revealed connections between
them through domain registration and hosting services. By using tools
like Censys and Shodan, they uncovered potential links to malware C2
servers and identified common mistakes made by cybercriminals that can
aid investigations and takedowns. The investigation highlights the use
of a "private STUB" service offered by the FUDcrypter operators for
cybercriminals, showcasing their customer support methods and remote
monitoring capabilities. 

 HOW TO MIGRATE TO SASE AND ZERO TRUST (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The traditional network security model is no longer effective due to
the rise of cloud services and remote work, exposing vulnerabilities
in VPN solutions. A new approach, called Secure Access Service Edge
(SASE) and Zero Trust, emphasizes granular access control and secure
remote access to data and services. By adopting these solutions,
companies can enhance security, simplify management, and adapt to the
changing landscape of cybersecurity threats.

 DEEPSEEK R1 EXPOSED: SECURITY FLAWS IN CHINA'S AI MODEL (5 MINUTE
READ) [18] 

 DeepSeek's R1 model is a powerful model, but it lacks some of the
defenses that some of the more established competitors like ChatGPT's
models provide. R1 can be trivially jailbroken using the “evil
jailbreak” attack that the ChatGPT models are patched against. It
does not have any protections against generating malicious code or
unethical results. 

 FIVE REASONS TO CARE ABOUT OPENGREP (4 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Opengrep was announced as a forever open source fork after Semgrep
changed its licensing structure. James Berthoty highlights the
importance of an open source SAST for establishing a comparison
baseline for commercial SASTs, for the development of an industry
standard for abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and the ability for
community rules to unify open source scanners. Opengrep will gradually
implement some of the Semgrep pro features. 

 TRACKING A MALICIOUS BLOGSPOT REDIRECTION CAMPAIGN TO APATEWEB (15
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 This article analyzes the "ApateWeb" malware campaign, which uses
weaponized Blogspot links that appear legitimate but redirect users to
malicious content including phishing pages, malware, and scam sites.
Through technical investigation, the author identifies several key
tactics including VPN detection, internationalization for broader
targeting, and the use of "empty OK" responses to evade security
scanners, ultimately discovering over 9,500 domains involved in this
campaign. The analysis concludes by providing detailed indicators and
infrastructure information, including domain lists and investigation
tools, to help security teams identify and track similar malicious
redirector campaigns.
