 THREATLOCKER ALLOWLISTING: ZERO TRUST ENDPOINT PROTECTION (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 Many ransomware attacks start when a user runs a harmless-looking
executable on their endpoint device — and chasing down every new
install can be impossible.

ThreatLocker Application Allowlisting [4] puts you back in control
over everything that's running in your business. No remote access
tools, games, or coupon clippers - unless they're allowed.

The agent learns from your existing environment [4] to understand the
baseline of which software is required.

Easily see risks related to each installed application and decide
whether it stays or goes.

Simulate what happens once permissions are denied.

New versions of existing software are allowed by default.

Separate testing environment to evaluate new applications.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER DATA BREACH AFFECTS 1M PATIENTS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A cyberattack on the Community Health Center affected over 1 million
patients' personal and medical data. The breach, discovered on January
2, follows recent attacks on Frederick Health and NY Blood Center.
Though access was quickly blocked, CHC is offering affected patients
free identity theft protection and monitoring services. 

 TIME BANDIT CHATGPT JAILBREAK BYPASSES SAFEGUARDS ON SENSITIVE TOPICS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security researcher discovered a new jailbreak for ChatGPT that
involves abusing a mechanism to confuse ChatGPT into believing that
it's in the past (temporal confusion) and then asking ambiguous
questions. This vulnerability allowed the researcher to ask ChatGPT
for information such as how a programmer in the 1700s could create
polymorphic malware with modern techniques. The researcher attempted
to disclose this vulnerability to OpenAI with the aid of various
government agencies, but the vulnerability has not been fixed. 

 ISSUE WITH AWS SIGN-IN IAM USER LOGIN FLOW (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AWS has remediated an issue with IAM use sign-in flow that could
allow for a malicious user to enumerate logins. The vulnerability was
due to a timing attack in which the server response times for a valid
or invalid user varied. AWS remediated the issue by introducing a
timing delay across all authentication failure scenarios.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A BRIEF HISTORY OF MASS HACKS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Major cybersecurity tools meant to protect networks have repeatedly
become vectors for mass hacking campaigns. From 2023-2025,
vulnerabilities in products by Cisco, Citrix, Ivanti, Palo Alto, and
more have led to widespread breaches affecting thousands of
organizations and millions of individuals. This post dives into the
brief history of these attacks. 

 TESTING AND EVALUATING GUARDDUTY DETECTIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The AWS GuardDuty team has released a tool called GuardDuty Tester to
generate infrastructure and synthetic events to test GuardDuty alerts
and actions. This post walks through deploying GuardDuty Tester and
creating alerts and automations based on GuardDuty findings. AWS has
cautioned users to not run GuardDuty Tester in production environments
and ideally to use a dedicated account. 

 EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR LOCATION: TRACKING MYSELF DOWN THROUGH IN-APP ADS
(10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This investigation revealed how mobile apps, even with location
services disabled, leak sensitive data through real-time bidding (RTB)
systems and advertising networks, with Unity Ads, Facebook, and
various data brokers collecting precise location data, device
information, and behavioral patterns. It highlights how data brokers
create comprehensive user profiles by combining Mobile Advertising IDs
(MAIDs) with personally identifiable information (PII), suggesting
that security assessments should examine not just individual data
points but the entire data flow ecosystem, including third-party
integrations and data marketplace vulnerabilities.

 TEXAS GOVERNOR ORDERS BAN ON DEEPSEEK, REDNOTE FOR GOVERNMENT DEVICES
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Texas has banned DeepSeek and social media apps Xiaohongshu and
Lemon8 from government devices, citing security concerns about data
harvesting. The move follows similar bans on TikTok. DeepSeek has
gained popularity among U.S. users and emerged as an OpenAI

 AS OF FEBRUARY 2025: HARMFUL AI APPLICATIONS PROHIBITED IN THE EU (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The EU AI Act prohibits AI systems that pose unacceptable risks,
including manipulative systems, social scoring, unauthorized facial
recognition databases, and certain emotion recognition technologies.
Violations face fines up to €35M or 7% of annual turnover. 

 AI AGENT IDENTITY: IT'S JUST OAUTH (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 OAuth provides the perfect model for authenticating AI Agents as it
is designed for auditable and secure delegation of access. OAuth
adoption is scant and even where it exists, scopes are often very
minimal and incomplete. This solution doesn't scale to tools where the
AI is acting as the user's identity such as ChatGPT Desktop or Claude
computer use.
