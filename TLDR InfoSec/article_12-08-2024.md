 GRAB THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO SERVICE CONTROL POLICIES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Service Control Policies (SCPs) can be intimidating, but they are an
essential part of working in AWS, especially when used to keep a lid
on excessive permissions and reduce unnecessary risk!

Whether you're new to SCPs or looking for more advanced use cases, The
Ultimate Guide to Service Control Policies [4] will help you level
up.¬†

Start with the basics ‚Äî what are SCPs [4], how does their logic
work, and why are they useful ‚Äî and then dive much deeper into
topics such as:

 	* Specific scenarios [4] for when to use SCPs
 	* Practical tips for managing them more efficiently
 	* 5 pre-written policies [4] that you can start using today

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VULNERABILITY ALLOWED EAVESDROPPING VIA SONOS SMART SPEAKERS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NCC Group researchers have discovered vulnerabilities in Sonos smart
speakers that allow remote code execution and potential eavesdropping.
The flaw affects Wi-Fi drivers and could be exploited by nearby
attackers. These vulnerabilities have now been patched by Sonos and
updating drivers is recommended. 

 ALMOST UNFIXABLE ‚ÄúSINKCLOSE‚Äù BUG AFFECTS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
AMD CHIPS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers have discovered a security flaw, dubbed Sinkclose, in AMD
processors, affecting chips since 2006. The vulnerability allows
hackers to run malicious code in the chip's privileged System
Management Mode. While requiring initial access, Sinkclose enables
deep-seated malware installation that can survive OS reinstallation
and be extremely difficult to remove. 

 ECOVACS HOME ROBOTS CAN BE HACKED TO SPY ON THEIR OWNERS, RESEARCHERS
SAY (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Security researchers discovered severe vulnerabilities in Ecovacs
robots that allow hackers to take control via Bluetooth from up to 450
feet away. Once compromised, attackers can remotely access cameras,
microphones, and Wi-Fi credentials. Ecovacs hasn't responded to the
researchers' reports, leaving these vulnerabilities potentially
exploitable.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT'S THE WORST PLACE TO LEAVE YOUR SECRETS? ‚Äì RESEARCH INTO WHAT
HAPPENS TO AWS CREDENTIALS THAT ARE LEFT IN PUBLIC PLACES (15 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Researchers deployed canary tokens (aka fake AWS credentials) in
public online locations to study threat actor behavior. These digital
tripwires triggered alerts when accessed, revealing patterns in
credential discovery and attack methods. 

 TRAILSHARK: UNDERSTANDING AWS API AND SERVICE INTERACTIONS (2 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 TrailShark is a tool that integrates AWS CloudTrail logs with
Wireshark for real-time analysis of API calls. It helps identify
vulnerabilities in AWS services by monitoring internal API
interactions. TrailShark offers features like advanced filtering,
inner API call analysis, and custom event creation to enhance security
and transparency in AWS environments. 

 0.0.0.0 DAY: EXPLOITING LOCALHOST APIS FROM THE BROWSER (9 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Security researchers discovered a new vulnerability whereby websites
can bypass protections and send requests to 0.0.0.0 and reach internal
APIs that are listening on localhost. This vulnerability was able to
bypass Google Chrome's Private Network Access protections because
0.0.0.0 was not on the blocklist that it uses. Following the
researchers' findings, all major browsers have committed to blocking
requests to 0.0.0.0 and establishing Private Network Access as a
standard which will include 0.0.0.0 in its blocklist.

 ORACLE COUGHS UP $115M TO MAKE PRIVACY CASE GO AWAY (3 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Oracle has agreed to pay $115 million to settle a class action
lawsuit alleging user data misuse. The settlement, which affects 220
million people, requires Oracle to address privacy violations and
implement an audit program for customer compliance. 

 GHOSTWRITE VULNERABILITY AFFECTS RISC-V CPU, MITIGATING TAKES A ~77%
PERFORMANCE HIT (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A new CPU vulnerability called GhostWrite affects a common RISC-V
processor, allowing attackers to read/write to any part of the
computer's memory. Mitigating GhostWrite requires disabling around
half of the CPU's functionality, leading to a significant 77%
performance hit by turning off the vector extension support. The
vulnerability is not related to speculative execution. RISC-V chips
are becoming more popular targets for security researchers and
attackers. 

 A FIVE YEAR RETROSPECTIVE ON DETECTION AS CODE (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This author discusses Detection as Code and lessons learned in five
years as it has evolved beyond simply writing detection logic in
programming languages to focus instead on codifying processes and
leveraging CI/CD pipelines for automated checks and version control.
Test-Driven Detection (TDD), which emphasizes test creation before
writing detection logic, is emerging as a best practice. LLMs show
promise in auditing and improving detector descriptions within CI/CD
pipelines but aren't suitable for creating detection logic.
