ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CISCO WARNS OF CLAMAV DOS FLAW WITH POC EXPLOIT CODE (2 MINUTE READ)
[4] 

 Cisco has released security updates to patch a ClamAV vulnerability
that could lead to denial-of-service. The vulnerability is caused by a
heap-based buffer overflow in the OLE2 decryption routine that could
lead the program to crash when scanning maliciously crafted OLE2
content. Cisco has stated that PoC exploit code is publicly available
but there is no evidence of active exploitation. 

 IPANY VPN BREACHED IN SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK TO PUSH CUSTOM MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 South Korean VPN provider IPany was breached in a supply-chain attack
that deployed a custom SlowStepper malware. The attackers breached the
IPany development environment and added their custom SlowStepper
malware to the VPN installation. The SlowStepper C2 malware supports
commands that gather system information, fetch and run files from the
C2 server, enumerate and exfiltrate files, run Python-based spyware
tools, run shell commands, execute syscalls, and delete files or
directories. 

 ZENDESK'S SUBDOMAIN REGISTRATION EXPOSED TO PHISHING, PIG BUTCHERING
SCAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security vulnerability in Zendesk's subdomain registration feature
allows cybercriminals to conduct phishing and investment scams.
CloudSEK researchers discovered that attackers can create fake
subdomains resembling legitimate brands to deceive victims. This poses
a significant risk as attackers can send convincing phishing emails
and manipulate users into sharing sensitive information or funds.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO USE TEMPORARY ACCESS PASS (TAP) WITH INTERNAL GUEST USERS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TAP is a Microsoft Entra ID solution that provides users with
temporary passwordless access so one of the other permanent
passwordless mechanisms can be configured. Previously, TAP would not
work for guest users as they would generally need to authenticate with
a remote provider. This blog post shows how to enable the newly
released Entra ID TAP for internal guests feature. 

 TRACKING CLOUD-FLUENT THREAT ACTORS: BEHAVIORAL IOCS (11 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Behavioral IOCs attempt to enrich a traditional IOC by correlating
multiple events to add context for more robust detections. This post
introduces the concept of behavioral IOCs in cloud environments and
provides an example of how Wiz developed IOCs for a specific threat
actor. It recommends beginning with a piece of identifying information
about a threat actor or tactic and then iteratively mapping out unique
parameters or other identifiers to detect that threat actor to the
IOC. 

 SECURING INHERITED CLOUD: TOP LESSONS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security professionals often get invited late to cloud projects,
causing panic over potential vulnerabilities. To secure these
environments, follow a playbook with steps like gaining access,
implementing least privilege access, enabling MFA, and conducting a
compromise assessment. By following the steps in this blog post, you
can take control, address security concerns, and protect valuable data
in cloud projects effectively.

 TERRAFORM S3 BACKEND SETUP: SKIP THE TABLE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Terraform makes use of lock files to ensure that multiple users are
not modifying a state file simultaneously. Prior to version 1.10,
users who were using the S3 backend required a DynamoDB table to store
the lock file. As of the newly released version 1.10, Terraform can
make use of S3 conditional writes to utilize S3 for both state file
and lock file storage. 

 TELEGRAM CAPTCHA TRICKS YOU INTO RUNNING MALICIOUS POWERSHELL SCRIPTS
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Threat actors are tricking Telegram users into running malicious
PowerShell scripts by pretending to be a captcha or verification
system. This tactic exploits the news around Silk Road founder Ross
Ulbricht to lure victims into downloading malware. Users should be
cautious and avoid running any unfamiliar commands on their devices to
avoid falling victim to such attacks. 

 MASTERCARD DNS ERROR WENT UNNOTICED FOR YEARS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 MasterCard had a DNS error, unnoticed for five years, that allowed
potential interception or redirection of internet traffic. A security
researcher discovered the error and prevented cybercriminals from
exploiting it by registering the mistyped domain. The issue has been
resolved, but it highlights the importance of careful domain
configuration for cybersecurity.
