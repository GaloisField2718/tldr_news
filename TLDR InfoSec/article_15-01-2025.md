time and boost productivity?

In this report, SafeBase looked at data from hundreds of Trust Centers

 COMPOUND PROBABILITY: YOU DON'T NEED 100% COVERAGE TO WIN (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Compound probability is a concept in which the probability of two
independent events occurring is the product of the probability of each
event occurring. It explains how increasing attack surface coverage
can significantly reduce an attacker's probability of evading
detection. The article acknowledges some oversimplifications,
particularly around EDR. 

 PASSWORD SPRAYING WITH SELENIUM AND FIREPROX (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Password spraying attempts can often be hindered by IP based rate
limiting. To circumvent this issue, this post walks through the setup
of a dynamic proxy using Fireprox as well as Burp Suite Bambdas to
modify the request to bypass CSP headers and other rate limiting. The
post then concludes by showcasing how Selenium can be combined with
the created proxy and crafted request to automate login attempts to
achieve a password spraying attack.
