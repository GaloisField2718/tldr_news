ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 INFORMATION OF 120,000 STOLEN IN RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON GEORGIA
HOSPITAL (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Memorial Hospital in Georgia suffered a ransomware attack in November
that affected 120,000 patients' personal and medical data. The Embargo

 APPLE FIXES ZERO-DAY EXPLOITED IN ‘EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED' ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Apple has pushed out security updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
Specifically called out was an attack that could allow sophisticated
attackers with access to a device to disable USB Restricted mode on a
locked device. This vulnerability was reported by Citizen Lab and is
being actively exploited. 

 OVER 12,000 KERIOCONTROL FIREWALLS EXPOSED TO EXPLOITED RCE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 KerioControl firewalls provide a network security suite for small and
medium sized businesses. The ShadowServer Foundation reports that over
12K devices are currently exposed to attacks leveraging a 1-click RCE
vulnerability. The vulnerability was caused by improper sanitization
of a GET parameter which led to Reflected XSS and resulted in a
1-click RCE.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 JOOKI - TAKING CONTROL OF A FORGOTTEN DEVICE (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post explores how to revive the abandoned Jooki children's audio
players through firmware analysis and discovering exploits after the
company's bankruptcy left devices non-functional. The solution uses
Mender for software updates and can be controlled through a web
interface, enabling customization and potential security risks. The
author notes that by understanding its firmware, access points, and
potential vulnerabilities, users can interact with Jooki more
effectively and securely. 

 YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PASSKEYS WRONG (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Some in the security community have argued that passkeys have failed
at their promise of passwordless authentication and should instead be
used as a second factor due to complexities such as account recovery
on a new device. The author of this post argues that this reflects an
improper way of thinking about passkeys and presents a
login/registration flow that uses magic links for new
device/registration and then uses passkeys for subsequent access. 

 FOUNDATIONS FOR MODERN DEFENSIBLE ARCHITECTURE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has published a modern
defensible architecture framework based on zero trust principles
("never trust, always verify," "assume breach," and "verify
explicitly") and five key pillars (Identity, Devices, Networks,
Applications/Workloads, and Data), emphasizing that organizations
should prepare for "when" not "if" a cyber incident occurs. These
principles, based on zero trust and secure-by-design practices, aim to
enhance cyber resilience and protect critical assets. Organizations
can use the Foundations to build a strong security framework adaptable
to evolving technologies and threats.

 UK'S SECRET APPLE ICLOUD BACKDOOR ORDER IS A GLOBAL EMERGENCY, SAY
CRITICS (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 The UK government allegedly secretly ordered Apple to create a
backdoor in its encrypted iCloud storage, potentially affecting users
worldwide. Critics and privacy advocates warn this sets a dangerous
precedent as Apple may respond by discontinuing its Advanced Data
Protection feature in the UK rather than compromise global security. 

 THE RISKS OF USER IMPERSONATION (20 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article dives deep into user impersonation risks and
mitigations, which is a common way to allow logging in as another
user. This feature is often implemented by changing the sub property
of a JWT but is inherently problematic as it requires maintaining an
admin list and securing the feature, is insecure by design, and also
muddies audit trails. One possible solution is to add a new claim to
the JWT but this is error prone and instead advocates for using DOM
recording to collect as much sanitized data about a user's session as
possible instead. 

 AMAZON REDSHIFT ENHANCES SECURITY BY CHANGING DEFAULT BEHAVIOR (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Amazon Redshift team has announced changes to the default
settings for new Redshift clusters and those restored from snapshots.
These clusters will now block public access and encrypt data at rest
and in transit by default. Existing clusters will not be affected but
Amazon recommends users implement the changes regardless.
