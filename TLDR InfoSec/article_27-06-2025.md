ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL CISCO ISE VULNERABILITIES ALLOW REMOTE CODE EXECUTION (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Cisco announced fixes for two critical (CVSS 10/10) vulnerabilities
in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity
Connector, which could allow unauthenticated remote code execution
(RCE). The first vulnerability is caused by a lack of input
validation, which allows unauthenticated attackers to submit crafted
API requests and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The
second vulnerability is caused by a lack of file validation, which
could allow an attacker to store malicious files in arbitrary
directories on the device. 

 HACKERS TURN SCREENCONNECT INTO MALWARE USING AUTHENTICODE STUFFING
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cybersecurity firm G DATA is warning users of ConnectWise's
ScreenConnect remote monitoring and management (RMM) software about a
new malware campaign that utilizes ScreenConnect installers with a
malicious configuration embedded in the authenticode certificate. The
malicious installer is configured to have the title “Windows
Update,” change the background to a Windows Update image, and
connect to an attacker-controlled server. ConnectWise has revoked the
certificates used in these binaries. 

 GLASGOW COUNCIL SERVICES REMAIN OFFLINE A WEEK AFTER CYBER ATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Glasgow City Council suffered a cyberattack on June 19 via IT
supplier CGI's third-party servers, disrupting online services
including planning applications, payments, and pension portals.
Customer data may have been stolen, but the confirmation has not yet
been made.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CYBERCRIMINALS ABUSE OPEN-SOURCE TOOLS TO TARGET AFRICA'S FINANCIAL
SECTOR (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Threat actor CL-CRI-1014 has been targeting African financial
institutions since July 2023. The attackers use open-source tools
(PoshC2, Chisel, and Classroom Spy) and forge file signatures to
establish network access. The group operates as initial access
brokers, selling compromised financial institution access on darknet
markets. 

 MARKETPLACE TAKEOVER: HOW WE COULD'VE TAKEN OVER EVERY DEVELOPER
USING A VSCODE FORK; PUTTING MILLIONS AT RISK (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Security researchers have discovered a critical vulnerability in
open-vsx.org, the open-source VS Code extensions marketplace used by
over 8 million developers across popular editors such as Cursor,
Windsurf, and VSCodium. The flaw allowed attackers to steal admin
credentials through a CI pipeline issue, enabling them to publish
malicious updates to every extension on the marketplace and
potentially compromise millions of developer machines. The
vulnerability was responsibly disclosed in May and patched after
multiple iterations over several weeks. 

 5 YEARS, 160 COMMENTS, AND THE VULNERABILITY THAT REFUSED TO DIE (8
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Jonathan Leitschuh discovered an old vulnerability in SnakeYAML that
could enable remote code execution through unsafe deserialization. The
maintainer initially closed the report as “Won't Fix,” claiming a
safe constructor made the code safe. After a lengthy discussion, PoCs,
data, and a nearly hour-long call, Leitschuh convinced the maintainer
to use the secure constructor by default and make insecure behavior
opt-in, marking a win for secure defaults in SnakeYAML 2.0.

 IRANIAN HACKERS ARE TRYING TO CREATE A PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR IN
CYBERSPACE (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 A new report by cybersecurity agency DomainTools alleges that the
Iranian-backed CyberAv3ngers group is shifting its operations to focus
on misinformation and psychological warfare. The CyberAv3ngers have
been active since 2023, and while they have been tied to confirmed
intrusions, they have also claimed targets that have been debunked.
According to the report, the group has refined cyber activity “into
a fully realized propaganda apparatus” with the goal of not just
breaching systems but “to control the narrative surrounding those
breaches.” 

 QILIN RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON NHS SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTED TO PATIENT
FATALITY (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The NHS confirmed a patient died following Qilin's ransomware attack
on pathology provider Synnovis. A delayed blood test result due to
disrupted services contributed to the death. The attack affected
multiple London NHS trusts, harming 170 patients in total. This
represents a rare confirmed link between ransomware and patient
mortality. 

 WINDOWS KILLED THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH (2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Microsoft is replacing Windows' iconic Blue Screen of Death with a

change is part of the Windows Resiliency Initiative following the
CrowdStrike outage that affected 8.5 million devices. Microsoft calls
it a "simplified UI" but hasn't acknowledged the significance of
ending this computing era.
