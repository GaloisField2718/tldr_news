 AWS ARTICLE: SIMPLIFY HYBRID NETWORK SECURITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Managing security across hybrid networks can be challenging,
especially when consistent policies need to be set across systems.
Simplify your security approach to a single dashboard with AWS and
Fortinet.

This article explains how you can integrate Gateway Load Balancer with
FortiGate Next Generation Firewall [4] to centralize traffic routing
and inspection across your entire network. Explore configuring routing
tables, setting up security profiles, and enabling real-time threat
detection across hybrid environments.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DATA I/O BECOMES LATEST RANSOMWARE ATTACK VICTIM (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Data I/O, a tech manufacturer, suffered a ransomware attack on August
16 that led to major outages. The incident's impact remains unclear as
the investigation is still underway, but restoration of operations has
begun. Costs may be substantial. 

 FIRST AI-POWERED RANSOMWARE POC SPOTTED (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 PromptLock, the world's first known AI-powered ransomware, uses
OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b model to generate malicious scripts. It is
currently only a proof-of-concept and has not been seen in active
attacks. PromptLock demonstrates how AI can simplify cybercriminal
operations. 

 NX COMPROMISED TO STEAL WALLETS AND CREDENTIALS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The popular NX build system was compromised with malicious versions
published to npm that steal cryptocurrency wallets, API keys, and
credentials from at least 1,400 affected users. The malware creates
repositories prefixed with "s1ngularity-repository" in victims' GitHub
accounts. It uniquely leverages the Claude Code CLI or Gemini CLI to
execute file system searches for sensitive data through AI prompts,
making detection more challenging for traditional security tools.
Users should immediately check for unauthorized repositories, update
to version 21.4.1, and rotate all potentially compromised credentials,
including GitHub tokens, npm keys, and SSH keys.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BEWARE THE FALSE FALSE-POSITIVE: HOW TO DISTINGUISH HTTP PIPELINING
FROM REQUEST SMUGGLING (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Sometimes, when people are hunting for HTTP request smuggling
vulnerabilities, they actually run into false positives caused by
connection reuse. Some scenarios where connection reuse may be
necessary for finding vulnerabilities include situations where the
frontend server only reuses the upstream connection if the client
connection was reused, connection-state attacks, and client-side
desync attacks. James Kettle created a Custom Action for Burp Suite
called `Smuggling or pipelining?` to distinguish between a genuine
HTTP smuggling attack and an HTTP pipelining false-positive. 

 BEHIND THE COINBASE BREACH: BRIBERY EMERGES AS ENTERPRISE THREAT (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Threat actors like The Com and Scattered Spider bribed TaskUS workers
in India with up to $2,500 to steal data from 70,000 Coinbase
customers, resulting in a $20 million ransom demand that Coinbase
refused, offering the same as a bounty. The breach revealed a shift
from phishing to insider targeting through bribery, primarily
targeting customer support staff with data access. Coinbase fired 226
workers, opened a US support hub, and enhanced controls. Experts
advise red-team exercises to test employee responses to bribery
attempts worldwide. 

 THE ONE WHERE WE JUST STEAL THE VULNERABILITIES (CRUSHFTP
CVE-2025-54309) (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A flaw (CVE-2025-54309) in CrushFTP servers allows attackers to gain
administrative access if certain features are disabled. Researchers
used a honeypot sensor network to catch hackers exploiting this race
condition in real time and confirmed that two coordinated HTTP
requests could add a rogue admin account. The vulnerability impacts
thousands of vulnerable servers and is being exploited in the wild,
highlighting the need for organisations to patch and monitor for
unusual activity.

 AI NOTETAKERS ARE PRIVACY AND SECURITY NIGHTMARES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO
BE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Most AI note-takers create AI governance gaps: over-capture, default
model training, and the spread of Shadow AI. Fellow [11] puts you in
control with policy-based recording, consent/disclosure, transcript
redaction, role-based access, retention, audit logs, SSO/SAML and no
training on your data. Record meetings without causing a security
meltdown. Try Fellow today [11]. 

 BRUTEFORCEAI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 BruteForceAI is an advanced penetration testing tool that transforms
traditional brute-force attacks by incorporating large language models
for smart form analysis. The tool automatically detects login form
selectors with AI and then performs complex multi-threaded attacks
that mimic human behavior. 

 MERCATOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Mercator is an open-source web application designed to manage the
mapping of information systems, as described in ANSSI's "Mapping the
Information System Guide". 

 REACH SECURITY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Reach Security employs virtual assistants in exposure management to
automate drift detection, policy enforcement, and remediation. Its new
ConfigIQ Drift module empowers customers to set custom deviation rules
and baselines, all of which are managed centrally.

 NEW SNI5GECT ATTACK CRASHES PHONES AND DOWNGRADES 5G TO 4G WITHOUT
ROGUE BASE STATION (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Sni5Gect is a framework that can downgrade 5G connections to
vulnerable 4G, crash phone modems, and bypass authentication by
passively sniffing unencrypted messages between base stations and
phones during the initial connection phase before authentication. The
attack achieves 80% sniffing accuracy and 70-90% message injection
success rates from up to 20 meters away, exploiting the window before
NAS security context establishment without requiring a rogue base
station. Tests successfully targeted phones from OnePlus, Samsung,
Google, and Huawei. The GSMA has acknowledged the vulnerability as
CVD-2024-0096. 

 ANTHROPIC'S AUTO-CLICKING AI CHROME EXTENSION RAISES
BROWSER-HIJACKING CONCERNS (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic's new Claude for Chrome AI extension, now in limited
preview, allows AI to control browser actions but poses significant
security risks. Researchers found these AI agents are vulnerable to
hidden, malicious website instructions, with attacks succeeding up to
23.6% of the time. Although new safety measures cut success rates,
experts warn browser-integrated AI may be fundamentally unsafe for
now. 

 ‘VIBE-HACKING' IS NOW A TOP AI THREAT (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cybercriminals are misusing agentic AI systems, such as Claude, to
power new types of cyberattacks. In one major case, a single actor
utilized AI to extort data from 17 organizations by crafting targeted
extortion demands and executing sophisticated attacks end-to-end,
highlighting how AI enables complex threats with minimal resources.
