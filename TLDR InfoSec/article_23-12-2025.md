ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SSH SERVER DROPBEAR ALLOWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Dropbear SSH server versions through 2024.84 contain CVE-2025-14282
(CVSS 9.8 Critical), which allows privilege escalation to root via
Unix socket forwarding. Programs that authenticate forwarded
connections, by misusing SO_PEERCRED, receive root credentials instead
of the actual user's credentials. Dropbear 2025.89 fixes this by
implementing comprehensive changes to Unix socket handling and
disabling socket forwarding when forced command options are used,
preventing command restriction bypass. Organizations running Dropbear
on embedded systems, such as OpenWRT routers and single-board
computers, should immediately update or deploy the temporary
mitigation using the dropbear -j flag (which also disables TCP
forwarding) or compile with #define DROPBEAR_SVR_LOCALSTREAMFWD 0 in
localoptions.h and distrooptions.h header files. 

 1,000 COMPUTERS TAKEN OFFLINE IN ROMANIAN WATER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
HACK — RANSOMWARE TAKES BITLOCKER-ENCRYPTED SYSTEMS DOWN (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Romanian water authorities suffered a ransomware attack that
encrypted systems using BitLocker and disabled about 1,000 computers
across 10 of 11 regional offices. Core IT services, such as email, web
platforms, databases, and GIS, were impacted, though the water supply
continued. 

 NPM PACKAGE WITH 56K DOWNLOADS CAUGHT STEALING WHATSAPP MESSAGES (7
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The lotusbail npm package masqueraded as a legitimate WhatsApp Web
API fork with functional code while secretly intercepting
authentication tokens, messages, contacts, and media files through a
malicious WebSocket wrapper. The malware employed sophisticated
evasion techniques, including custom RSA encryption, four-layer
obfuscation, 27 anti-debugging traps, and a hardcoded pairing code
that established persistent backdoor access surviving package removal.
Security professionals should implement behavioral runtime analysis to
detect anomalous activities, such as custom encryption in
communication libraries, and manually unlink all devices from WhatsApp
settings if compromised.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 VULNHALLA: PICKING THE TRUE VULNERABILITIES FROM THE CODEQL HAYSTACK
(10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Modern vulnerability research can blend static analysis with large
language models to cut through overwhelming false positives and
highlight only issues that look genuinely exploitable. By feeding
CodeQL findings and carefully chosen code context into an LLM, and
then guiding it with structured questions about data and control flow,
the system mimics how senior researchers reason about real bugs rather
than surface patterns. Pre-extracting functions and related entities
into fast-searchable CSVs makes this scalable across huge C and C++
codebases, enabling discovery of impactful issues and even new CVEs
with modest time and compute. 

 BEYOND THE BOMB: WHEN ADVERSARIES BRING THEIR OWN VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR
PERSISTENCE (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Red Canary detected a novel attack where adversaries deployed spam
bombing followed by fake tech support calls leveraging Quick Assist to
introduce a QEMU virtual machine (Windows 7 SP1) running Sliver C2
implants, QDoor backdoor, and ScreenConnect for redundant persistence.
The VM was configured for internal network reconnaissance via SRV
record queries and external C2 communications to marnyonline[.]com and
45[.]61[.]169[.]127. Forensic analysis of the 8GB disk image revealed
the adversary's toolkit through prefetch data, browser history,
persistence mechanisms in start.txt, and volume shadow copies
containing deleted artifacts. Defenders should monitor for anomalous
QEMU execution on standard endpoints, implement strict Quick Assist
controls, detect internal SRV record enumeration and ping sweeps with
single-packet patterns, hunt for Sliver team server SSL certificates
with CN=multiplayer and O=operators fingerprints, and deploy
behavioral analytics to identify VM deployment following remote
assistance sessions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MACPERSISTENCECHECKER (GITHUB REPO) [9] 

 MacPersistenceChecker is a native macOS security tool that enumerates
all persistence mechanisms across 20+ categories, including launch
agents, system extensions, and BTM database entries, scoring each item
0-100 based on code signatures, LOLBins detection, and behavioral
anomalies mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework. The tool includes
real-time monitoring with optional Claude AI integration that analyzes
changes using full context, including risk scores and intent
mismatches, plus MCP server support enabling Claude Code integration
for natural language queries against persistence data. Security teams
can leverage containment features to quarantine suspicious items with
automatic backup and timed release. 

 TOKENFLARE (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 TokenFlare is a serverless AITM phishing simulation framework
targeting Entra ID/M365. Its core logic is just 530 lines of
JavaScript. TokenFlare supports multiple OAuth flows, including Intune
Conditional Access bypass techniques, and is deployable to Cloudflare
Workers or a local HTTPS proxy, with built-in bot/scraper blocking and
production-ready infrastructure, in under 60 seconds. The framework
captures credentials, auth codes, and session cookies via configurable
webhooks, uses modular campaign configuration for custom branding and
URL structures, and includes Certbot integration for automated SSL
certificate provisioning. Blue teams can detect TokenFlare via static
IoCs: the HTTP header "X-TokenFlare: Authorised-Security-Testing" and
the User-Agent "TokenFlare/1.0 For_Authorised_Testing_Only". They
should monitor for serverless worker abuse, suspicious OAuth flows
with rapid authentication handoffs, and webhook exfiltration patterns
targeting M365 authentication tokens. 

 DOCKER HARDENED IMAGES FOR FREE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 Docker has released over 1,000 secure images that are free and open
source for developers. These images are regularly scanned and updated
to minimize or eliminate exploitable CVEs. They run as non-root by
default, are minimal to lower the attack surface, meet compliance
standards, and are available across multiple distributions.

 US DOJ CHARGES 54 IN ATM JACKPOTTING SCHEME USING PLOUTUS MALWARE (3
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The DOJ indicted 54 individuals linked to Venezuelan gang Tren de
Aragua for deploying Ploutus malware in a multi-million dollar ATM
jackpotting operation involving 1,529 incidents since 2021, resulting
in $40.73 million stolen to fund terrorist activities. Attackers
conducted physical reconnaissance, opened ATM hoods to test alarm
responses, then installed Ploutus by replacing hard drives or
connecting USB drives to issue unauthorized commands to Cash
Dispensing Modules while deleting forensic evidence. The malware
targets Windows-based ATMs (particularly legacy XP systems and Diebold
models) and can be activated via a physical keyboard with activation
codes. Financial institutions should implement physical tamper
detection on ATM enclosures, upgrade legacy Windows XP systems,
monitor Cash Dispensing Module command patterns for anomalies,
implement hard drive integrity checks and USB port access controls,
and deploy enhanced physical security measures, including alarm
response verification protocols. 

 HACKTIVISTS SCRAPE 86M SPOTIFY TRACKS, CLAIM THEIR AIM IS TO PRESERVE
CULTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Hacktivists linked to Anna's Archive scraped around 86 million
Spotify tracks, claiming to safeguard musical heritage from
catastrophes and platform risk, yet only about a third of Spotify's
total catalog is actually preserved as audio. Spotify calls the
operation piracy. It shut down the scraping accounts and plans to
strengthen safeguards. Anna's Archive has hinted at possible future
single‑track downloads. 

 SOUTH KOREA TO REQUIRE FACIAL RECOGNITION FOR NEW MOBILE NUMBERS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 South Korea plans to require facial recognition when people sign up
for new mobile numbers, matching ID photos with real-time images to
block phones registered under false identities. The rule, which
applies to major carriers and virtual operators, starts on March 23.
Authorities hope to curb widespread voice phishing scams and address
security weaknesses exposed by a massive SK Telecom data breach that
affected 27 million SIM subscribers.
