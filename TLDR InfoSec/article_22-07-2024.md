 SKIP THE SALES PITCH WITH FOSSA'S FREE SCA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most developer tools let you try before you buy. But in application
security, too many vendors force you through endless demo calls and
artificial POCs just to see the tool.

FOSSA is doing things differently ‚Äî letting the product speak for
itself [5] in the form of a [4]generous free tier.

No scheduling calls. No complex setups.

Just sign up [6] and dive in:

‚Üí Get hands-on with [4]full-featured SCA tools from minute one

‚Üí Prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities in real-world conditions,
not sanitized demos

‚Üí See how SBOM generation and license compliance work in your
environment

‚è∞ This ISN'T a time-limited trial. This is real open source security
and compliance for all.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VULNERABILITY IN CISCO SMART SOFTWARE MANAGER LETS ATTACKERS CHANGE
ANY USER PASSWORD (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Another Cisco critical vulnerability has been disclosed.
CVE-2024-20419 allows unauthenticated attackers to change any user's
password, including administrators'. This flaw in the password-change
process enables access to the web UI or API with compromised user
privileges. No workarounds exist. Cisco released a security update and
reports no active exploitation. 

 MNGI DIGESTIVE HEALTH DATA BREACH IMPACTS 765,000 INDIVIDUALS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 MNGI Digestive Health is notifying over 765,000 individuals about a
data breach from August 2023. The breach, discovered nearly a year
later, potentially exposed sensitive personal and health information,
including names, Social Security numbers, medical data, and financial
details. MNGI is currently working to inform affected individuals
through written notifications. 

 TECHNICAL DETAILS: FALCON CONTENT UPDATE FOR WINDOWS HOSTS (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 CrowdStrike has shared technical details on the Falcon Update that
caused a global outage on July 19. The issue impacted customers using
the Falcon sensor for Windows version 7.11 and above between specific
times on July 19. CrowdStrike has fixed the error in Channel File 291
and is conducting a root cause analysis to prevent similar incidents
in the future.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PHANTOM SECRETS: UNDETECTED SECRETS EXPOSE MAJOR CORPORATIONS (10
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The AquaSec team scanned over 50k repositories belonging to the top
100 organizations on GitHub for secrets using conventional (git clone)
and unconventional methods. Using git clone --mirror fetches a more
complete git history that includes PRs and other dangling refs. It led
to finding additional secrets on 18% of scanned repositories. The Aqua
team also tested a novel approach to scanning cached views from SCMs
and found that some additional secrets could be found, though the
process is difficult and has a lower chance of success. 

 SNEAKY WRITE HOOK: GIT CLONE TO ROOT ON K8S NODES (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 The gitRepo volume driver is a deprecated k8s storage driver that
allows for reading files into a pod from a remote git repository. This
post examines a vulnerability in the gitRepo driver whereby a
maliciously crafted git repository could sneak git hooks into a node
and execute commands as root. The authors submitted a PR to fix this
issue which will be released in version 1.31. 

 VIEW STATE, THE UNPATCHABLE IIS FOREVER DAY BEING ACTIVELY EXPLOITED
(25 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 This blog post discusses why the ViewState vulnerability is not used
for exploits despite being around for a long time and explains how it
can be done on a fully patched Microsoft Exchange 2019 host. It
explains how to exploit view state vulnerabilities and the process of
resetting compromised machine keys in IIS. It also highlights the
risks associated with resetting machine keys and provides steps to
regenerate them based on whether they were automatically generated or
static.

 COMMAND ZERO (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Command Zero's platform for investigation combines autonomous and
user-led methods in a federated data model and leverages automation
and advanced Language Learning Models to augment human investigations.

 Network inspection library for Node that allows packet crafting and
parsing as well as capturing network traffic and sending packets in
all formats. 

 FRAGTUNNEL (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Fragtunnel is a PoC tool for tunneling TCP traffic through IDS/IPS
engines and Next Generation Firewalls. It exploits the fact that they
allow a limited number of packets before making a decision on whether
to allow or deny the traffic.

 WEST AFRICAN CRIME SYNDICATE TAKEN DOWN BY INTERPOL OPERATION (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Operation Jackal III, a global law enforcement effort targeting West
African crime groups, resulted in 300 arrests and $3 million in asset
seizures. There are 400 additional suspects across 21 countries. 

 THE CLOUD SHARED IRRESPONSIBILITY MODEL (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Shared Responsibility Model is used by cloud providers to
describe a split in security responsibilities where cloud providers
are responsible for the underlying services and users are responsible
for securing their workloads built on those services. Customer
breaches could result in negative reputational damage to cloud
providers. This forces cloud providers to improve their defaults to be
more secure. 

 NAVIGATING THE RDP SECURITY CONSEQUENCES OF TLS VS. NLA FROM A THREAT
EXPOSURE PERSPECTIVE (6 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This article compares RDP security using TLS-only versus NLA.
NLA-secured servers faced significantly more login attempts but also
provided more insights into attacker tactics. Geographical origins of
attacks differed between NLA and TLS, with certain countries showing
preferences for one protocol over the other. While NLA is considered
more secure, it may attract more sophisticated attacks. Researchers
found NLA honeypots to be more valuable for understanding
cybersecurity threats and the human element behind them.
