 EMAIL THREATS ARE RISING—BASIC DEFENSES STILL LAG (SPONSOR) [4] 

 83% OF IT LEADERS HAVE FACED EMAIL-RELATED SECURITY INCIDENTS, and
nearly half saw them happen in just the past year. Phishing and
spoofing top the list—making email not just a communication tool,
but a frontline risk surface. But despite the risk, ONLY 33% HAVE
IMPLEMENTED CORE PROTECTIONS like DMARC, DKIM, or SPF. 

The disconnect is clear: exposure is rising, but the fundamentals are
still missing. 

Exclaimer's latest research reveals how IT leaders are reassessing
their defenses and building email into their broader risk
posture—without adding more manual work.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HYBRIDPETYA RANSOMWARE BYPASSES UEFI SECURE BOOT ECHOING
PETYA/NOTPETYA (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The HybridPetya ransomware on VirusTotal echoes the infamous
Petya/NotPetya attacks but adds UEFI bootkit capabilities and exploits
CVE-2024-7344 to bypass UEFI Secure Boot on outdated systems. Unlike
NotPetya, HybridPetya functions as actual ransomware with decryption
capabilities, encrypting the Master File Table after compromising EFI
partitions and displaying fake CHKDSK status before showing ransom
demands. This marks the fourth known UEFI bootkit with Secure Boot
bypass capability, joining BlackLotus, BootKitty, and the Hyper-V
Backdoor PoC, indicating these sophisticated attacks are becoming more
common. 

 WHITECOBRA FLOODS VSCODE MARKET WITH CRYPTO-STEALING EXTENSIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A threat actor named WhiteCobra has been flooding the VSCode
marketplace and OpenVSX registry with malicious extensions targeting
VSCode, Cursor, and Windsurf users. The extensions contain an
extension.js file that is nearly identical to the Hello World example
but loads a prompt.js file, which downloads and executes a
platform-specific infostealer payload from Cloudflare Pages. An
Ethereum core developer reported on X that their wallet was drained
after downloading a seemingly legitimate extension with a professional
logo, detailed description, and 54K downloads. 

 SAMSUNG PATCHES ACTIVELY EXPLOITED ZERO-DAY REPORTED BY WHATSAPP DEVS
(2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Samsung patched a remote code execution vulnerability that impacted
Samsung devices running Android 13 or later. The vulnerability arose
from an out-of-bounds write in the libimagecodec.quram.so library,
which is used for image parsing. Apple patched the relevant
vulnerability in its devices last month after it was reported to it by
WhatsApp and Meta researchers as well.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE CURIOUS TALE OF A FAKE CARRIER.APP (17 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Google Project Zero found a fake carrier app exploiting a heap
overflow in Apple's DCP firmware on iPhone 12/13. The exploit bypassed
kernel protections by targeting the DCP's weaker security, using a
fake Vodafone app distributed via enterprise certificates to sideload
malware. The vulnerability (CVE-2021-30983) caused memory corruption
through an unbounded loop in display code, allowing attackers to gain
kernel access by corrupting C++ objects and manipulating memory
between the DCP and main system. 

 UNMASKING THE GENTLEMEN RANSOMWARE: TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND
PROCEDURES REVEALED (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Gentlemen ransomware group has executed sophisticated attacks
across 17 countries, focusing on sectors like manufacturing and
healthcare. Their operations use custom tools to bypass security
measures, exploit privileged accounts, and deploy ransomware with
double extortion tactics. The campaign demonstrates a shift to highly
tailored, evasive strategies, raising the bar for enterprise defense
and incident response recommendations. 

 SUPABASE SECURITY BEST PRACTICES (2025 GUIDE) (20 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This comprehensive guide addresses frequent security pitfalls seen in
Supabase deployments, offering precise and practical solutions
grounded in recent audits. It covers how components like
authentication, database schemas, Edge Functions, storage, and CORS
interact from a security perspective and how to secure them with
simple, effective policies—such as “read-only by default”,
automate audits, and revisit configurations as the platform evolves.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI-POWERED EMAIL ATTACKS JUST MET THEIR MATCH - AN AI DETECTION
ENGINEER (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Email attacks are evolving faster than security teams can write
rules. Sublime's ADÉ [12] (Autonomous Detection Engineer) fights fire
with fire: while hackers automate phishing and social engineering
attacks, ADÉ automatically creates and backtests Detection Rules [12]
in response to missed attacks.

Unlike black-box AI solutions, ADÉ writes transparent, explainable
rules that analysts can understand and verify [12]. When attacks slip
through, ADÉ analyzes signals, creates or updates rules, validates
against historical data, and presents clear logic for human review. It
closes detection gaps in hours - and it does so per-environment,
rather than with one-size-fits-all rules.

 GROUPPOLICYBACKDOOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 GroupPolicyBackdoor is a tool for Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
manipulation and exploitation. 

 REDACCESS (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Red Access provides an agentless security platform that protects web
sessions and assets across browsers and apps, enabling secure access,
data loss prevention, and visibility for remote and hybrid enterprise
environments. 

 GARUDRECON (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 GarudRecon is an automated reconnaissance framework designed for
asset discovery, vulnerability detection, and continuous monitoring.

 600 GB OF ALLEGED GREAT FIREWALL OF CHINA DATA PUBLISHED IN LARGEST
LEAK YET (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Hacktivists from Enlace Hacktivista leaked nearly 600 GB of data
supposedly from China's Great Firewall, exposing source code,
communications, and documents from Geedge Networks and MESA Lab, key
to the censorship system. The leak reveals that the Great Firewall
operates as a commercial platform called "Tiangou," which has been
exported to Myanmar, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, and other Belt
and Road countries for surveillance purposes. The 500 GB archive
includes source code, project records, and internal documents
revealing how China's censorship functions and spreads globally
through public-private partnerships. 

 MODDER INJECTS AI DIALOGUE INTO 2002'S ANIMAL CROSSING USING MEMORY

Tom Nook. Using memory hacking and two Python scripts, the mod injects
dynamic, AI-generated dialogue into the game, with a writer creating
the dialogue and a director adding technical elements.
