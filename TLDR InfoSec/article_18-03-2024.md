LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 WHAT DOES AN EFFECTIVE VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT TICKETING WORKFLOW
LOOK LIKE? (SPONSOR) [9] 

 Organizations are inundated with alerts and potential
vulnerabilities, making it crucial to sift through the noise and
prioritize responses efficiently.

But what makes a vulnerability management ticketing workflow [9] not
just functional, but truly effective?

This question and many others will be answered in this upcoming
webinar featuring Scott Kuffer, Co-Founder and COO of Nucleus Security
[9], and a surprise security expert guest. See you there! [9] 

 DNS-TUNNEL-KEYLOGGER (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 DNS-Tunnel-Keylogger is a tool for lightweight exfiltration and
persistence, with properties that prevent detection. It uses DNS
tunneling/exfiltration to bypass firewalls and avoid detection. 

 GITDOORCHECK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 GitDoorCheck is a static analyzer for GitHub repositories powered by
OpenAI-compatible LLMs. The tool uses GPT-4 or other compatible LLMs
to scan repositories for backdoors and output the results as a JSON.
It can be added to CI/CD pipelines. 

 INDICATOR OF CANARY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Indicator of Canary is a collection of PoCs gathered from research on
identifying canaries in various file formats.

 ANDROID MALWARE DISGUISED AS WEDDING INVITATION SENT TO SENIOR
CITIZENS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Android malware targeting the elderly was sent out as fabricated
wedding invitations. The victims, believing the APK to contain more
details about a free wedding, installed the malware and ended up
having their SMS data stolen. The malware used a Telegram bot as its
command and control server. 

 DEATH KNELL OF THE NVD? (5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 As the publishers of CVEs, the NVD is a core part of many security
systems. The NVD recently posted an announcement that it is
establishing a consortium to address challenges within the
organization. This has led to 90% of proposed CVEs going unassigned
and the association of CPEs, CVSS, and CWEs to CVEs to be severely
halted. This author proposes a few alternatives to the NVD. 

 NEW ACOUSTIC ATTACK DETERMINES KEYSTROKES FROM TYPING PATTERNS (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers from Augusta University have developed a new acoustic
side-channel attack that can deduce user input based on typing
patterns. The attack leverages the distinctive sound emissions of
different keystrokes and users' typing patterns. The method can reach
a typing prediction accuracy of 43% on average, even in poor
conditions such as environments with noise, and does not require
controlled recording conditions.
