ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SALESFORCE TAGS 5 CVES AFTER SAAS SECURITY PROBE UNCOVERS MISCONFIG
RISKS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Salesforce assigned 5 CVEs after a security report revealed 20+
configuration weaknesses in Flexcards, Data Mappers, and core
components. These vulnerabilities could expose customers to
unauthorized access and session hijacking. 16 other flaws were
classified as customer misconfigurations. Admins have been urged to
review and secure configurations to prevent exploitation. 

 MIRAI BOTNETS EXPLOITING WAZUH SECURITY PLATFORM VULNERABILITY (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Akamai are warning of two Mirai botnet campaigns
exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in the open-source
security platform Wazuh. The first campaign has been active since
March and uses a malicious shell script to download the Mirai payload.
The second campaign seems to be targeting Italian-speaking users. 

 ZERO-CLICK AI DATA LEAK FLAW UNCOVERED IN MICROSOFT 365 COPILOT (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from AIM Labs discovered an attack against Microsoft 365
Copilot, an AI assistant built into Office apps, that allowed for the
leaking of sensitive data. The attack involved embedding a hidden
prompt in an email which bypasses Microsoft's cross-prompt injection
attack classifier because it is phrased as text to a human. Later when
the user requests Copilot's RAG engine to retrieve data from the
email, the prompt is interpreted and injected into the LLM.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE FIVE SECURITY PRINCIPLES DRIVING OPEN SOURCE SECURITY APPS AT
SCALE (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AI has revolutionized cybersecurity innovation, enabling startups to
develop products and rapidly disrupt legacy providers. However, a
paradox exists between fostering innovation and managing security
vulnerabilities and compliance costs. Successful startups embed
governance strategically, automate security with AI, contribute
purpose-built tools, and prioritize community building for long-term
advantage. 

 A BIT MORE ON TWITTER/X'S NEW ENCRYPTED MESSAGING (14 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 X's XChat messaging protocol uses flawed end-to-end encryption. It
lacks forward secrecy, and stores user private keys on X's servers
using Juicebox protocol across three software-based servers (not
HSMs). This allows X to potentially decrypt messages for internal
purposes or legal compulsion, making XChat's encryption largely
ineffective against surveillance. 

 COMPLEX NPM ATTACK USES 7+ LAYERS OF OBFUSCATION TO SPREAD PULSAR RAT
(4 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Researchers from Veracode detected a malicious NPM package called
“solders” which uses a post-install hook to run the malicious
lib.js file without user interaction. The lib.js file obfuscates the
first layer using JavaScript type coercion to build up the strings
from Japanese Unicode. The decoded string then uses hex encoding,
array shuffling, and binary array encoding to build a base64 encoded
PowerShell script that downloads a batch script that utilizes string
reordering, 3DES encryption, and steganography.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MAZE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Maze is building technology that models the workflow of an
experienced analyst, where each agent ingests telemetry from a
customer's public cloud accounts, reproduces the steps an attacker
would take to move laterally, and then either closes the gap
automatically or flags a concise set of exploitable weaknesses. 

 MCP FOR SECURITY (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MCP for Security: A collection of Model Context Protocol servers for
popular security tools like SQLMap, FFUF, NMAP, Masscan, and more.
Integrate security testing and penetration testing into AI workflows. 

 CLAWS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Claws is a static analysis tool for GitHub Actions modeled after
Rubocop.

 THE 18-POINT SECRETS MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A roadmap from Hashicorp on how an organization can mature in its
secrets management process. The guide is broken up into the adopting
stage, where secrets management is first integrated; the standardizing
stage, where automatic secrets rotation and compliance are introduced;
and the scaling stage, where operations are scaled up and more
services like PKI are managed. Each stage is broken up into three
categories with actionable checklist items. 

 SMARTATTACK USES SMARTWATCHES TO STEAL DATA FROM AIR-GAPPED SYSTEMS
(3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SmartAttack is a new method that uses smartwatches to steal data from
air-gapped computers secretly using ultrasonic sound. The attack needs
malware on the computer and a nearby smartwatch to receive hidden
audio signals. Experts suggest banning smartwatches and removing
computer speakers from secure areas to stop this. 

 THE EVOLUTION OF LINUX BINARIES IN TARGETED CLOUD OPERATIONS (7
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Unit 42 researchers identified five actively evolving Linux ELF
malware families (NoodleRAT, Winnti, SSHdInjector, Pygmy Goat, and
AcidPour) that threat actors are adapting to target cloud
infrastructure, with cloud-based security alerts increasing 388% in
2024. These malware strains use techniques like dynamic linker
hijacking and SSH daemon injection to achieve persistence, command and
control, and data exfiltration in Linux-based cloud environments that
comprise 70-90% of cloud computing instances. Palo Alto Networks' new
machine learning detection module successfully identified 92% of
tested ELF malware samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of
ML-based approaches for detecting these evolving cloud threats.

 INTERPOL DISMANTLES 20,000+ MALICIOUS IPS LINKED TO 69 MALWARE
VARIANTS IN OPERATION SECURE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 INTERPOL conducted a global operation across 26 countries to shut
down over 20,000 malicious IPs associated with 69 types of
data-stealing malware, resulting in the arrest of 32 suspects and the

 HACKERS TARGET RECRUITERS, POSING AS JOB SEEKERS AND SENDING
MALICIOUS RESUMES (2 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Hackers are deceiving recruiters by masquerading as job seekers and
submitting fake resumes that contain harmful files, which can
compromise a company's system when opened. 

 40,000 SECURITY CAMERAS EXPOSED TO REMOTE HACKING (2 MINUTE READ)
[20] 

 Over 40,000 security cameras globally are accessible online, enabling
hackers to potentially view or exploit live footage, particularly in
homes and offices where security is often weak or non-existent.
