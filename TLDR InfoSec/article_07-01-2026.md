 YOUR TEAM CAN'T KEEP UP WITH ALERT VOLUME. AI SOC ANALYSTS CAN
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Hiring can't solve this. Training takes too long. Analysts burn out
and quit. Meanwhile, critical alerts pile up in your queue while your
team wastes time on false positives.

SOC teams deploying AI SOC analysts [4]:

 	* Indiana Farm Bureau: 75% less manual work
 	* Assala Energy: 70% fewer false positives, 5X faster
 	* CBTS: 50% more alert volume, zero new hires

25-minute investigations now take 3-10 minutes. Same team, 10X
capacity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CLICKFIX ATTACK USES FAKE WINDOWS BSOD SCREENS TO PUSH MALWARE (5
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Securonix tracked a ClickFix campaign (PHALT#BLYX) targeting European
hospitality firms through phishing emails impersonating Booking.com
reservation cancellations, leading victims to a high-fidelity clone
site that displays fake Windows BSOD screens in full-screen browser
mode. The social engineering attack tricks users into executing
malicious PowerShell commands that download and compile a .NET project
using MSBuild.exe, thereby deploying the DCRAT remote access trojan,
which includes keylogging, reverse shell, remote desktop
functionality, and cryptocurrency mining. Hospitality organizations
should implement email filtering for Booking.com impersonation
attempts, educate staff that legitimate BSOD screens never provide
recovery instructions or commands to execute, and monitor for
suspicious MSBuild.exe compilation activity and Windows Defender
exclusion modifications. 

 HACKTIVIST DELETES WHITE SUPREMACIST WEBSITES LIVE ONSTAGE DURING
HACK CONFERENCE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A hacktivist who goes by Martha Root deleted the websites of
WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal in real time at the end of a talk
about the websites at Chaos Communication Congress. Root infiltrated
the sites using AI chatbots that bypassed verification processes and
were verified as “white.” Root also leaked data from the sites,
including users' profiles with names, pictures, descriptions, ages,
locations, genders, languages, races, and other personal information. 

 NEW N8N VULNERABILITY (9.9 CVSS) LETS AUTHENTICATED USERS EXECUTE
SYSTEM COMMANDS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical flaw in n8n (CVE-2025-68668) allows authenticated users
with workflow permissions to bypass the Python sandbox and run
arbitrary OS commands on the host, scoring 9.9 on CVSS. The issue
affects versions 1.0.0 through 2.0.0 and is fixed in 2.0.0.
Mitigations include disabling the Code Node, turning off Python
support, or using task runner-based isolation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WINNING THE AI CYBER RACE: VERIFIABILITY IS ALL YOU NEED (13 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 AI-powered cyber offense is outpacing defense because offensive tasks
offer binary, easily verifiable outcomes, while defensive tasks like
SIEM analysis, GRC assessments, and forensics lack reliable mechanical
verifiers, resulting in noise-heavy signals with precision rates below
1% that make model training ineffective. Research demonstrates the
verifiability gap's impact: OpenAI's o3 achieved 90% CTF challenge
success versus GPT-4's 20%, DARPA AIxCC results showed autonomous
vulnerability detection improving from 37% to 77%, and Microsoft's
Project Ire reached 98% precision by wrapping LLMs with proper tool
scaffolding, compared to Google's Sec-Gemini at 12% precision without
verifiers. Security leaders should prioritize building mechanical
verifiers and adopt offense-first thinking through continuous AI red
teaming, as whoever owns the verifiers wins the AI security race. 

 ESCAPING ISLA NUBLAR: COMING AROUND TO LLMS FOR FORMAL METHODS (13
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CNnotator is a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with
formal verification to generate memory-safety annotations for C code
automatically. It works through an iterative process where
LLM-generated annotations are tested against a CN verifier. This
approach addresses the challenge of translating legacy C/C++
code—which accounts for 70% of Chromium's security bugs—into
memory-safe languages like Rust. Testing showed that OpenAI's o3
reasoning model achieved a 90% success rate on the first attempt and
97% within three attempts. 

 REVERSE ENGINEERING MY CLOUD-CONNECTED E-SCOOTER AND FINDING THE
MASTER KEY TO UNLOCK ALL SCOOTERS (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 The Äike electric scooter relies entirely on a cloud-backed mobile
app for locking, unlocking, and other controls, which becomes risky
once the manufacturer goes bankrupt and services degrade. By reverse
engineering the Android app, using Frida to intercept BLE GATT traffic
and Java hashing calls, the author uncovers a SHA-1–based
challenge-response that incorrectly uses a global default key rather
than a unique per-device secret. With this knowledge, any nearby Äike
scooter can be authenticated to and remotely commanded via a short
Python proof-of-concept using Bleak.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PYFRC2G (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 PyFRC2G converts pfSense and OPNSense firewall rules into graphical
flow diagrams and PDF documentation through API-based alias retrieval,
automatic interface detection, and per-interface output generation
with color-coded visualization. The tool implements smart change
detection using MD5 comparison to regenerate graphs only when rules
change, generates separate CSV and PDF files for each interface using
Graphviz, and supports optional CISO Assistant integration for
automatic upload of compliance evidence. Security teams can use
PyFRC2G to visually document complex firewall rule sets and meet IT
security compliance requirements across various frameworks without
manual configuration files. 

 FAIL2BAN (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Fail2Ban scans log files and bans IP addresses that conduct too many
failed login attempts. It does this by updating system firewall rules
to reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a configurable
amount of time. Fail2Ban comes out-of-the-box ready to read many
standard log files, such as those for sshd and Apache. It can be
easily configured to read any log file of your choosing, for any error
you wish. 

 RUSTSCAN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 RustScan is a modern Port scanner that helps find ports quickly (3
seconds at its fastest for 65k ports).

 RUSSIA-ALIGNED HACKERS ABUSE VIBER TO TARGET UKRAINIAN MILITARY AND
GOVERNMENT (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 UAC-0184 (Hive0156), a threat actor aligned with Russia, used the
Viber messaging platform to send malicious ZIP files containing LNK
files disguised as Office documents to Ukrainian military and
government targets. The attack involved multiple stages, including the
deployment of Hijack Loader via PowerShell, which employed DLL
side-loading and module stomping techniques to bypass detection from
major security vendors like Kaspersky, Avast, BitDefender, AVG,
Emsisoft, Webroot, and Microsoft. Afterward, it injected Remcos RAT
into chime.exe for cyber espionage and data theft. Ukrainian
organizations should improve monitoring of messaging platforms beyond
email, adopt behavioral detection for Hijack Loader and Remcos RAT,
and bolster defenses against social engineering attacks that exploit
trusted communication channels. 

 THE SHIFT FROM DISK IMAGING TO DIGITAL TRIAGE (8 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Quick Triage addresses digital forensics backlogs by shifting from
traditional bit-for-bit disk imaging to rapid artifact-focused triage,
enabling field decisions within minutes rather than months of lab
analysis. The "desktop pivot" strategy exploits cloud synchronization
mechanics where mobile data protected by iOS Secure Enclave or Android
TEE encryption becomes accessible on Windows systems with weaker
BitLocker protection. Waymo's trade secret theft (Registry USB logs)
demonstrated how Windows artifact analysis solves investigations when
mobile extraction fails. Investigators are advised to prioritize
communication artifacts and web activity as immediate lead sources
before comprehensive forensic imaging. 

 NORDVPN DENIES BREACH AFTER HACKER LEAKS DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A threat actor claims to have brute-forced a misconfigured NordVPN
server, allegedly leaking data, including Salesforce and Jira
information, but NordVPN's forensic review found no compromise of its
infrastructure. The threat actor attributed the leak to a third-party
testing platform that used only dummy data without any real customer
information, source code, or credentials.
