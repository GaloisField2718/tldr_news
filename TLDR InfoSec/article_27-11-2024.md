ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACKERS ABUSE AVAST ANTI-ROOTKIT DRIVER TO DISABLE DEFENSES (2 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Trellix researchers have discovered a malware campaign that utilizes
an old and vulnerable Avast anti-rootkit driver to evade detection.
The malware drops the vulnerable driver in the default Windows user
folder, then creates a service using sc.exe and registers the driver.
The driver then leverages the DeviceIOControl API to terminate
processes from a hardcoded list of 142 processes associated with
various security solutions. 

 ROMCOM EXPLOITS 0-DAY FIREFOX AND WINDOWS FLAWS IN SOPHISTICATED
CYBERATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers are warning of a new campaign from the Russia-linked
RomCom APT that exploits a use-after-free 0-day in Firefox and a
privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows Task Scheduler. The
attackers are using a fake website that redirects users to a secondary
website which hosts the malicious payload. The payload executes shell
code using the Firefox exploit which runs an embedded library to break
out of the browser's sandboxed environment via the Task Scheduler
exploit to install the RomCom RAT. 

 SOFTWARE FIRM BLUE YONDER PROVIDING SERVICES TO US AND UK STORES,
INCLUDING STARBUCKS, HIT BY RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Blue Yonder, a software provider for stores like Starbucks, was hit
by a ransomware attack that caused disruptions to operations.
Starbucks had to switch to manual mode for employee scheduling after
the attack. The company is working with cybersecurity firms to recover
and investigate the breach, with no timeline for full restoration yet.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXCEPTION JUNCTION - WHERE ALL VECTORS MEET THEIR HANDLER (10 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Vectored Exception Handler (VEH) is a global exception handler
mechanism in Windows that has fewer limitations than Structured
Exception Handling. This post provides code that dynamically locates
the offset to register a custom VEH and discusses the complexities
that arise in the process. It also provides a YARA rule to detect the
registered pattern. 

 UNMASKING PHISHING: STRATEGIES FOR IDENTIFYING 0KTAPUS DOMAINS AND
BEYOND (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog discusses strategies for identifying phishing campaigns,
particularly those associated with the threat actor 0ktapus, which
uses various social engineering techniques to trick victims into
giving up their credentials. Researchers can uncover and detect
phishing domains linked to 0ktapus and other threat actors by
analyzing phishing infrastructure and using techniques like monitoring
newly registered domains. Employing these techniques can help in
spotting and preventing future phishing campaigns before attackers
succeed in their goals. 

 ANALYSIS OF ELPACO: A MIMIC VARIANT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers analyzed a Mimic ransomware variant named Elpaco using
the Everything library for file searching and customization. Elpaco
includes a GUI for attackers to customize ransomware operations,
encrypt user data, demand ransom payments, and exhibit sophisticated
features. The ransomware variant manipulates files, uses a ChaCha20
stream cipher, and evades detection by securely erasing its executable
files.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 EMULATOR (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A high-performance Windows User Space emulator that operates at the
syscall level. 

 DEFENDERYARA (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 This repository includes YARA rules extracted from Defender
mpavbase.vdm and mpasbase.vdm files. The mpavbase.vdm file contains
the antivirus base definition module and the mpasbase.vdm file
contains the antispyware base definition module. 

 BRAINSTORM TOOL RELEASE: OPTIMIZING WEB FUZZING WITH LOCAL LLMS (6
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Brainstorm is a web fuzzing tool that combines AI with traditional
techniques to find hidden web application endpoints more efficiently.
It uses local LLM models and ffuf to automate path generation and
discover more endpoints with fewer requests. The tool is available on
GitHub. It offers a more effective approach compared to traditional
wordlists for web fuzzing tasks.

 MICROSOFT ROLLS OUT RECALL TO WINDOWS INSIDERS WITH COPILOT+ PCS (3
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 After multiple delays due to privacy concerns, Microsoft announced
that users in the dev Windows Insider channel with Snapdragon PCs will
only be able to enable Recall if they have Windows Hello, BitLocker,
and Secure Boot enabled. Recall will automatically filter sensitive
content and include anti-malware protections such as anti-hammering
and rate-limiting. It will be removed by default from enterprise
devices, but IT admins will have the option to enable it. 

 THE BLACK TEAM OPS HONEYPOT (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A SpacialSec team member posted a satirical review of a fictitious
Black Team Ops certification and course that gained traction and was
receiving legitimate inquiries. SpacialSec took this as an opportunity
to set up a registration page for the fictitious course and use it as
a honeypot to capture registration details for those who would be
interested in a course that included criminal topics like SIM
swapping. SpacialSec then replaced the domain with a fake FBI seizure
notification and sent a fictitious message to registrants that they
were subject to FBI investigation. This post includes excerpts from
“support” conversations with registrants, statistics, and some
funny logs. 

 NEW NACHOVPN ATTACK USES ROGUE VPN SERVERS TO INSTALL MALICIOUS
UPDATES (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 "NachoVPN" vulnerabilities allow malicious VPN servers to install
harmful updates on unpatched Palo Alto and SonicWall SSL-VPN clients.
Attackers can trick users into connecting to rogue VPN servers through
social engineering or phishing, potentially leading to credential
theft and code execution. SonicWall and Palo Alto Networks have
released patches to address the vulnerabilities. AmberWolf has
provided additional details and an open-source tool.
