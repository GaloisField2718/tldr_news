 WHAT COMES AFTER THE CORPORATE FIREWALL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The corporate firewall is a relic of bygone times. With employees
working from coffee shops, airports, and home networks, traditional
perimeter security leaves your endpoints exposed to unmanaged devices
and compromised networks.

ThreatLocker Network Control [5] brings the firewall to each endpoint
with dynamic ACLs that automatically adjust based on location. Unlike
VPNs that route through central points, it creates direct, secure
endpoint-to-endpoint connections [5].

⚡ Create custom policies to open ports on demand for approved
devices and users.

⚡ Ports auto-close within 5 minutes when not in use.

⚡ Manage all endpoint firewalls from one console.

✅ No IT tickets needed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FORTRA ADDRESSED A MAXIMUM SEVERITY FLAW IN GOANYWHERE MFT SOFTWARE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fortra has patched a critical deserialization vulnerability
(CVE-2025-10035) with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0 in the GoAnywhere
Managed File Transfer software that allows attackers to execute
arbitrary commands through the License Servlet. The company has urged
customers to upgrade to version 7.8.4 or sustaining release 7.6.3 and
recommends restricting public access to the GoAnywhere Admin Console
to mitigate exploitation risks. This follows previous high-severity
vulnerabilities in the same product, including an authentication
bypass flaw (CVE-2024-0204) discovered in January 2024. 

 ATTACKERS ABUSE AI TOOLS TO GENERATE FAKE CAPTCHAS IN PHISHING
ATTACKS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Trend Micro researchers have discovered a new phishing campaign that
utilizes Lovable, Netlify, and Vercel to build and host vibe-coded
phishing campaigns posing as CAPTCHA pages. The campaigns begin with
an email carrying urgent messages such as “Password Reset
Required,” which directs the user to a fake CAPTCHA. The fake
CAPTCHA then redirects the user to the phishing page, which harvests
their credentials. The CAPTCHA pages make the attacks seem more
legitimate and filter out security tools. 

 NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER ALERTS 194K PEOPLE TO DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 The New York Blood Center (NYBCe) has confirmed that nearly 194K
people had their data breached during an attack from January 20 to
January 26. The breached data includes names, SSNs, driver's license,
state ID numbers, bank account details, health information, and test
results.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU DON'T NEED QUANTUM HARDWARE FOR POST-QUANTUM SECURITY (15 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Organizations can prepare for quantum computing threats (Q-day) using
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) deployed on existing hardware without
needing expensive quantum technologies like quantum key distribution
(QKD) or quantum random number generators (QRNG). Being “quantum
ready” means systems remain secure after quantum computers can break
conventional cryptography. Beware of vendor claims that quantum
hardware products are necessary for quantum-resistant security.
Organizations should prioritize implementing PQC algorithms on current
infrastructure rather than investing in quantum hardware solutions
that are neither necessary nor sufficient for protection against
quantum adversaries. 

 HOW TO MANAGE AI BOTS WITH AWS WAF AND ADVANCED SECURITY (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 AI bots can be problematic as they can use proprietary data to train
models, cause performance degradation, or allow for unwanted
agentic/automatic behavior. Some bots, such as Applebot, Amazonbot,
and Googlebot, respect robots.txt and will obey directives that tell
them not to train on a website's data. AWS WAF can offer rate-limiting
rules, CAPTCHA, or honeypots for the Bot Control group to account for
bots that don't respect robots.txt. 

 MONITORING BASH `READLINE` WITH EBPF CO-RE & LLM ASSISTANCE (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 Although the eBPF Compiler Collection (BCC) can monitor bash
commands, it compiles programs dynamically, so the complete Clang/LLVM
toolchain must be shipped to every machine. eBPF CO-RE (Compile Once -
Run Everywhere) can enable portability across different kernel
versions without recompilation. This article walks through how to
write an eBPF program to monitor the `readline` program to monitor
bash commands.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 IS YOUR THREAT INTELLIGENCE MISSING THE ACTUAL CONVERSATION?
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 Static threat feeds only skim the surface. While you're reading
yesterday's news, threat actors are coordinating in closed Telegram
groups and private forums that are rarely reached by threat
intelligence vendors. Primary Source Collection [12] gets you inside
those spaces - with real-time access to encrypted chats, invite-only
communities, and adversarial planning. Read the Flashpoint whitepaper
[12] 

 BYTECASTER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 ByteCaster is a new tool that aims to be a Swiss Army Knife for
payload encryption, obfuscation, and conversion to byte arrays in a
single command. It supports three encryption algorithms, four
encoding/obfuscation algorithms, and 14 output formats. 

 HAVE I BEEN PWNED DEMOS ARE NOW LIVE (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Troy Hunt has launched a new series of demos exploring different
features of the Have I Been Pwned platform. The first demo covers
domain searches. 

 SPEARSPRAY (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 SprearSpray is an advanced password spraying tool for Active
Directory environments. It combines LDAP user enumeration with
pattern-based password generation.

 DISRUPTION AT EUROPEAN AIRPORTS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace's check-in and boarding systems
disrupted operations at major European airports, including Heathrow,
Brussels, and Berlin, forcing airports to rely on manual check-in
procedures and causing flight delays and cancellations that continued
into Sunday. Brussels Airport asked airlines to cancel half of their
Sunday departing flights to mitigate disruptions. 29 total departures
and arrivals were cancelled across the three main affected airports.
The European Commission confirmed the incident is under investigation,
though officials stated there's no evidence of a widespread or severe
attack. 

 CHINESE NETWORK SELLING THOUSANDS OF FAKE US AND CANADIAN IDS (3
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 CloudSEK exposed a China-based operation called “ForgeCraft” that
sold over 6,500 counterfeit US and Canadian driver's licenses and
Social Security cards to more than 4,500 buyers, generating over
$785,000 in revenue through 83 websites and using covert packaging
methods to ship fake IDs hidden in everyday items. The sophisticated
fake documents feature scannable barcodes, holograms, and UV markings
and pose national security risks by enabling financial fraud,
bypassing border checks, and potentially facilitating voter fraud.
CloudSEK researchers identified the main operator's location in
Xiamen, China, and shared evidence with authorities to disrupt the
operation.
