STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GOOGLE ACCOUNT MISCONFIG LETS ANY GMAIL ACCOUNT CONTROL YOUR CLUSTER
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Orca has discovered a new vulnerability, dubbed Sys:All, which
impacts an estimated 250,000 GKE clusters. Orca researchers said that
the vulnerability stems from a misunderstanding whereby users believe
that the system:authenticated group in GKE includes only verified and
deterministic identities as opposed to any Google authenticated
account. This means that any Google user can obtain an OAuth bearer
token and utilize it to authenticate to the GKE cluster and obtain any
overly permissive permissions granted to the system:authenticated
group.

hunting guidance for identifying similar attack tactics and
techniques.
