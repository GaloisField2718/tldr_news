ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK HITS ZSCALER VIA SALESLOFT DRIFT, LEAKING
CUSTOMER INFO (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Zscaler confirmed that a threat actor compromised OAuth tokens via
the Salesloft Drift integration from August 8 to 18, exposing business
contacts and Salesforce data. Though core infrastructure remained
secure, the breach revealed names, emails, job titles, phone numbers,
and licensing info. The attack extended beyond Salesforce, targeting
AWS keys and Snowflake tokens across multiple organizations. Zscaler
revoked Drift's access and rotated API tokens. 

 MALICIOUS GO MODULE DISGUISED AS SSH BRUTE FORCER EXFILTRATES
CREDENTIALS VIA TELEGRAM (6 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Go module "golang-random-ip-ssh-bruteforce" mimics an SSH
brute-force tool but secretly exfiltrates credentials to a Telegram
bot (@sshZXC_bot) controlled by Russian-speaking threat actor
IllDieAnyway. It scans random IPv4 addresses on port 22, attempts to
log in with default IoT credentials (such as "root"/"admin" with
passwords like "toor"), and then stops after the first successful
login to avoid detection. Active since June 2022 and still on
pkg.go.dev despite removal requests, it exploits trust in security
tools, turning them into credential harvesters using
ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey() and the HTTPS Telegram API are used to
evade monitoring. 

 PALO ALTO NETWORKS DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFO, SUPPORT CASES
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Palo Alto Networks suffered a data breach due to compromised OAuth
tokens from the Salesloft Drift breach. The attacker primarily
extracted business content and related account information, internal
sales account records, and basic case data from their Salesforce
environment. They were searching for secrets, including AWS access
keys, Snowflake tokens, VPN and SSO login strings, and generic
keywords.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOUR CONNECTION, THEIR CASH: THREAT ACTORS MISUSE SDKS TO SELL YOUR
BANDWIDTH (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Attackers have been exploiting CVE-2024-36401 in GeoServer to deploy
legitimate SDKs and bandwidth-sharing apps that monetize victims'
internet connections, operating stealthily with minimal resource
consumption while generating passive income through residential proxy
networks. The campaign uses Dart-compiled executables distributed via
transfer. To maintain persistence, attackers are targeting over 7,000
exposed GeoServer instances globally, while evading detection by
shifting their infrastructure with different IP addresses. The exploit
leverages JXPath extension functions to achieve remote code execution,
allowing attackers to download and execute monetization payloads that
masquerade as legitimate passive income services. 

 BEYOND IAM ACCESS KEYS: MODERN AUTHENTICATION APPROACHES FOR AWS (4
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Long-lived IAM access keys can present risks such as credential
exposure, unauthorized sharing, or theft. AWS CLI access can be
achieved with CloudShell or via IAM Identity Center to avoid using
access keys. Users can work with IDEs without using access keys by
leveraging the AWS Toolkit extension for IDEs such as VS Code. IAM
roles can be leveraged by CI/CD pipelines, on-premise workloads, or
third-party applications instead of access keys. 

 THE WONDERFULLY LAZY WAY TO SSH INTO YOUR COMPUTERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Tailscale offers a web-based SSH tool called Tailscale SSH that can
be used to SSH into connected devices without the need to manage SSH
keys. It utilizes an ephemeral authentication key to create an
end-to-end encrypted tunnel in a pop-out browser window to allow for
one-click access via the admin panel. Tailscale SSH requires users to
run the open-source version of Tailscale's Mac client to access Macs
and does not work on Synology or QNAP systems.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SAMLSMITH (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SAMLSmith is a C# tool designed for creating custom SAML responses
and executing Silver SAML and Golden SAML attacks. It offers extensive
features suitable for security researchers and penetration testers
dealing with SAML-based authentication systems. 

 WE BUILT THE SECURITY LAYER MCP ALWAYS NEEDED (6 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 `mcp-context-protector` is a security wrapper for LLM apps using MCP
that defends against line jumping attacks and prompt injection via
tool descriptions and ANSI escape codes. It requires users to review
new and modified server descriptions and tool definitions. The tool
sanitizes ANSI sequences to prevent prompt injection and is
implemented as an MCP. It is unable to evaluate chain-of-thought
attacks. 

 BURPA (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository is a maintained fork of the Burp Automator tool,
originally at 0x4D31/burpa, which was left abandoned. It provides a
high-level CLI and Python interfaces to Burp Suite scanner and can be
used to set up Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

 ISO 27001:2022 REQUIREMENTS EXPLAINED FOR 2025 (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Any organization that wishes to retain its ISO 27001 certification
must upgrade to the latest 2022 standard by October. This post breaks
down the clauses that cover formal certification requirements and are
the focus of the audit process and provides examples of how each
clause can be applied in practice. The post also highlights which of
the Annex A controls were revised or added in the 2022 standard. 

 INFOSTEALERS: THE SILENT SMASH-AND-GRAB DRIVING MODERN CYBERCRIME (8
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Modern infostealers operate through a sophisticated
malware-as-a-service model, executing complete credential harvests
within minutes using silent entry, stealthy data collection (including
session cookies that bypass MFA), and traceless exfiltration before
victims realize they've been compromised. These tools have evolved
from simple keyloggers into turnkey identity harvesting systems that
extract browser credentials, hardware IDs, personal documents, and
cryptocurrency wallets, with stolen logs selling for as little as $10
on underground markets and Telegram channels. The harvested
credentials serve as the foundation for 90% of corporate breaches,
enabling initial access brokers to monetize compromised accounts
through ransomware operations, financial fraud, and identity theft in
an increasingly specialized cybercrime economy. 

 JAGUAR LAND ROVER SHUTS DOWN IN SCRAMBLE TO SECURE 'CYBER INCIDENT'
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Jaguar Land Rover halted operations after a cyberattack disrupted its
retail and production activities. The company is carefully rebooting
its global applications, reporting no customer data theft so far.
Experts say the breach was spotted late, and JLR is now working with
responders to restore service and lock out attackers from its systems.
