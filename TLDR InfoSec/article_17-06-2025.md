 VIDEO: HOW WE BLOCKED A RANSOMWARE ATTACK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers used stolen domain admin credentials to infiltrate a
hospital network - aiming to deploy remote access tools, steal
sensitive data, and unleash ransomware.

Watch this short video [4] to learn how this attack crippled other
hospitals, and how ThreatLocker stopped it in its tracks [4]:

 	* Application Allowlisting blocked unauthorized software from
running.
 	* Storage Control prevented data from being accessed or moved.
 	* The attackers couldn't deploy tools.
 	* They couldn't spread.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TREND MICRO FIXES CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES IN MULTIPLE PRODUCTS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trend Micro has released security updates to fix multiple
critical-severity remote code execution (RCE) and authentication
bypass vulnerabilities in its Apex Central and Endpoint Encryption
(TMEE) PolicyServer products. Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption
PolicyServer is a central management server for TMEE, providing full
disk and removable media encryption for Windows endpoints. The
vulnerabilities include three pre-auth RCEs that stem from insecure
deserializations and an auth bypass due to a broken auth
implementation. 

 OVER 8M EXPOSED AFTER MAJOR CAR-SHARING APP BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 India's largest ride-sharing app, Zoomcar, has notified the SEC that
it suffered a data breach that exposed the data of 8.4M individuals.
Zoomcar was notified of this breach when the threat actor contacted
certain employees about their unauthorized access. The breached data
includes names, phone numbers, car registration numbers, personal
addresses, and email addresses, but does not include financial
information or plaintext passwords. 

 RANSOMWARE GANG EXPLOITS SIMPLEHELP RMM TO COMPROMISE UTILITY BILLING
FIRM (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The CISA has released an advisory that a path traversal vulnerability
in the SimpleHelp Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM) tool is
actively exploited. Sophos reported that the DragonForce ransomware
gang is chaining this vulnerability with two other vulnerabilities to
deploy ransomware across client networks. Following encryption, the
threat actors employ a double extortion strategy, demanding a ransom
for the data and threatening to leak the stolen data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CALL STACKS: NO MORE FREE PASSES FOR MALWARE (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Elastic's Windows endpoint telemetry analyzes call stacks to identify
both the activity and the performer, enhancing malware detection. The
call stacks, or "return address stacks," can be manipulated by malware
using return address spoofing and stack frame crafting to conceal
malicious actions. Elastic enriches these stacks with module
information, applies behavioral tagging, and detects sophisticated
evasion tactics like SilentMoonwalk call stack spoofing. 

 INSIDE THE LOCKBIT'S ADMIN PANEL LEAK: AFFILIATES, VICTIMS AND
MILLIONS IN CRYPTO (21 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 On May 7, an anonymous hacker named "xoxo from Prague" breached
LockBit's admin panel and leaked an SQL database containing
operational data from December 2024 to April 2025. The leak revealed
that LockBit earned approximately $2.3 million from ransom payments
during this period, primarily targeting China and the manufacturing
sector, while its registration fee claims were grossly inflated at
only $10,000 to $11,000. Additionally, the leak disclosed details
about 75 affiliates and their connections to other ransomware groups
like RansomHUB, HellCat, and Evil Corp, with affiliates adjusting
ransom demands to match company revenues and specific geographic
targets. 

 DECEPTION FUNDAMENTALS: THE MISSING PIECE IN YOUR SECURITY STRATEGY
(6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Current deception technologies fail against skilled attackers due to
obvious fake assets that don't align with real infrastructure
patterns. Attackers exploit legitimate services and trusted channels,
like GitHub OAuth flows, for their own deception. Effective deception
involves analyzing real asset patterns and deploying fake assets
through trusted communication channels, following the formula:
Deception Assets + Communication Channels = Desired Effect. The key
principle is congruence—attackers engage with deceptions only when
found through expected channels, and the assets match their
experience, leading to methodical validation that increases their
dwell time.

INSTEAD (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Gemini is now enabled by default in Workspace, with access to Drive
and Docs [12]. You can't isolate sensitive content. A real risk for
teams handling client data, IP, or confidential files.

Might be time to rethink where your files live [11].

 SharpEye is an advanced Linux intrusion detection and system security
monitoring framework. It utilizes advanced analytics, machine
learning, and behavior-based detections. 

 ZIP_SMUGGLING (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 zip_smuggling is a Python utility that creates zip files that contain
additional data embedded within the file structure that is not
displayed when the zip is examined or decompressed, but can be
retrieved via PowerShell via an LNK within the zip file. 

 IAM-LENS (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Get visibility into the IAM permissions in your AWS organizations and
accounts. Use your AWS IAM policies (downloaded via iam-collect) and

 THE META AI APP IS A PRIVACY DISASTER (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The standalone Meta AI app has a share button that shows users a
preview of their posts and then publishes their conversations within
the app. However, many users seem unaware of this sharing. Researchers
have discovered conversations that include sensitive PII, users
requesting aid with committing tax evasion, and other sensitive
information. Notably, Meta does not indicate users' privacy settings
when they post. 

 270K WEBSITES INJECTED WITH ‘JSF-CK' OBFUSCATED CODE (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Nearly 270K websites have been compromised with malicious JavaScript
Injectors that are obfuscated using the ‘JSF-ck method.' This method
uses six ASCII characters to produce working JavaScript code by
relying on JavaScript's type coercion to encode numbers and letters
using crafted combinations of the characters. It leads to very long
and easy-to-detect code, but is challenging to unobfuscate without
specialized tools. 

 MACOS TAHOE BRINGS A NEW DISK IMAGE FORMAT (12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 macOS Tahoe introduces ASIF (Apple Sparse Image Format), a new disk
image format that achieves near-native speeds of 4.8-6.6 GB/s,
compared to traditional encrypted sparse images that only reach 100
MB/s on Apple silicon Macs. ASIF images, being intrinsically sparse
files in APFS, maintain efficient sizes regardless of the host file
system, ideal for virtual machines and high-performance storage. This
format can be created exclusively with Tahoe's Disk Utility or
diskutil command and is designed to work with macOS Sequoia for
mounting. It significantly outperforms existing disk image formats,
including sparse bundles, by utilizing a single file for storage.
