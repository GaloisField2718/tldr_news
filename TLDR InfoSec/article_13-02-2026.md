 BRICK YOUR NOISY SAST SCANNER (AND YOUR PHONE) 🧱📱(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Security teams drown in noise: you triage 100 findings, maybe 10
matter, and you lose trust. Meanwhile, devs end up context-switching
into code they haven't touched in weeks.

depthfirst [4] reduces false positives by 85% by tracing full attack
paths and validating what's exploitable before flagging it. And it
tells your devs exactly how to fix it, so the whole team can focus on
what matters.

AppSec that finally works, trusted by Lovable, Supabase, Moveworks,
Persona, and incident.io.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 APPLE FIXES ZERO-DAY FLAW USED IN 'EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED' ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple patched CVE-2026-20700, an arbitrary code execution
vulnerability in dyld (the Dynamic Link Editor) discovered by Google's
Threat Analysis Group, which was exploited in targeted attacks against
specific individuals running iOS versions before iOS 26, marking the
first Apple zero-day patched in 2026. The flaw, chained with two
previously patched vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-14174 and
CVE-2025-43529), affects iPhone 11 and later, iPad, Mac, Apple TV,
Apple Watch, and Vision Pro devices. Fixes are available in iOS
18.7.5, iPadOS 18.7.5, macOS Tahoe 26.3, tvOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, and
visionOS 26.3. 

 MICROSOFT'S NOTEPAD GOT PWNED (THEY ADDED AI TO IT, SO...) (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 CVE-2026-20841 (CVSS 8.8) is a command injection flaw in Microsoft's
updated Notepad (versions 11.0.0 to 11.2509). The vulnerability arises
because the Markdown handler does not validate link content before
execution, allowing attackers to execute remote code when users open a
malicious .md file and click an embedded link. Public proof-of-concept
exploits exist, and the vulnerability is actively being exploited,
granting attackers full permission to execute code. Microsoft
addressed this issue in Notepad build 11.2510+ on February 10. Users
are advised to disable Markdown and link previews when unnecessary. 

 APOLLOMD DATA BREACH IMPACTS 626,000 INDIVIDUALS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A May 2025 cyberattack on ApolloMD exposed PII and PHI for 626,540
people associated with affiliated physicians and practices, including
diagnoses, treatment details, insurance data, and, in some cases,
Social Security numbers. Notifications began in September 2025, with
free credit monitoring offered, and Qilin ransomware actors later
claimed responsibility on their leak site.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM PATCH TUESDAY TO PENTEST WEDNESDAY: CONTINUOUS VALIDATION IN A
REGULATED ENVIRONMENT (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A financial services organization transitioned from annual
compliance-driven pentesting to weekly continuous validation,
revealing that a single read-only AWS credential enabled 39 distinct
attack paths, including full account compromise in under 10 minutes
and access to over 100,000 sensitive files. The shift to frequent
automated testing reduced mean time to remediate from months to days,
with the team completing roughly 40 pentests in eight months and
uncovering previously invisible risks, including overly permissive SMB
shares, IAM privilege escalation paths, and a critical PAN-OS
vulnerability (CVE-2025-0108). The case study demonstrates how
continuous validation transforms security programs from point-in-time
compliance exercises into operational exposure management, where
findings are prioritized by proven exploitability and mapped to real
threat actor TTPs like Scattered Spider. 

 NATION-STATE ACTORS EXPLOIT NOTEPAD++ SUPPLY CHAIN (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Lotus Blossom compromised the Notepad++ hosting infrastructure
between June and December 2025, hijacking the update server to
selectively serve malicious installers to targets across government,
telecom, and critical infrastructure sectors in Southeast Asia, South
America, the US, and Europe. The attack delivered two infection chains
— a Lua script injection variant deploying Cobalt Strike beacons and
a DLL sideloading variant using a renamed Bitdefender component to
load the Chrysalis backdoor with Warbird-protected evasion techniques.
Users should manually update to Notepad++ v8.9.1 or later, which
includes certificate and signature verification for downloaded
installers. 

 BADPODS SERIES: EVERYTHING ALLOWED ON AWS EKS (6 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This is the first post in a series using BishopFox's BadPods, which
features a variety of pod manifests with varying levels of
misconfiguration, to investigate the protections included in different
cloud providers' managed Kubernetes offerings. This series includes
the most permissive pod manifest, which the author uses to trivially
escape the pod via a mounted host path and then further escalate
privileges within the account by stealing IAM credentials from IMDS.

 WE HID BACKDOORS IN BINARIES — OPUS 4.6 FOUND 49% OF THEM (13
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 BinaryAudit is an open-source benchmark from Quesma for evaluating AI
agents' ability to detect backdoors in stripped binary executables
using reverse engineering tools like Ghidra and Radare2. The benchmark
tests models against backdoored versions of lighttpd, dnsmasq,
Dropbear, and Sozu, with Claude Opus 4.6 leading at 49% detection but
hampered by a 22% false positive rate across clean binaries. Results
highlight that while AI-assisted binary analysis is becoming
accessible to non-specialists, high false positive rates and inability
to trace data flow through complex binaries make it unsuitable for
production malware detection today. 

 NUCLEUS (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Nucleus provides an exposure management orchestration platform that
ingests data from 200+ security and asset tools, normalizes and
correlates vulnerabilities with threat intel and business context to
prioritize and remediate risk across environments. 

 DOTENV (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables
from a .env file into process.env, storing configuration in the
environment and separating from code while following the Twelve-Factor
App methodology.

 KIMWOLF BOTNET SWAMPS ANONYMITY NETWORK I2P (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Kimwolf IoT botnet accidentally disrupted the I2P anonymity
network after attempting to register 700,000 infected devices as nodes
— a Sybil attack that overwhelmed the roughly 15,000-20,000 node
network — while seeking takedown-resistant C2 infrastructure. The
botmasters, who admitted to the disruption on Discord, have been
experimenting with both I2P and Tor as fallback command-and-control
channels after security companies and network operators intensified
efforts to combat the botnet. I2P is currently operating at roughly
half capacity as stability fixes roll out, while Kimwolf's overall
numbers have reportedly dropped by more than 600,000 infected systems
following internal operator disputes and operational errors. 

 MICROSOFT SAYS HACKERS ARE EXPLOITING CRITICAL ZERO-DAY BUGS TO
TARGET WINDOWS AND OFFICE USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft has shipped emergency fixes for several actively exploited
Windows and Office zero-days that enable one-click remote code
execution and SmartScreen bypasses across all supported Windows
versions. Attackers can silently run high-privilege malware, enabling
ransomware and espionage campaigns. Admins and end users are urged to
patch immediately and treat malicious links and Office files as high
risk. 

 GOOGLE REPORTS STATE-BACKED HACKERS USING GEMINI AI FOR RECON AND
ATTACK SUPPORT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Google's threat team details how North Korean group UNC2970 and
others weaponize Gemini for OSINT-driven target profiling, tailored
phishing, vulnerability analysis, and exploit debugging, blurring the
line between research and reconnaissance. Attackers also use Gemini's
API in HONESTCUE malware, AI-built COINBAIT phishing kits, and
large-scale model extraction attempts that clone Gemini's behavior via
high-volume prompt queries.
