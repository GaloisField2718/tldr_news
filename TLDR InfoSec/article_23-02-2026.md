 SECURE AWS WORKLOADS WITHOUT SLOWING DEPLOYMENTS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your security stack is growing, but so are your attack surfaces.
Containers, microservices, remote teams, and data lakes—each adds
complexity.

Teams building on AWS are solving this with hands-on tutorials [4]
that show exactly how to implement modern security patterns,
including:

 	* IDENTITY-BASED ACCESS CONTROLS to replace traditional VPN
complexity
 	* ZERO-TRUST SECURITY for east-west traffic without modifying
applications
 	* COMPREHENSIVE MALWARE PROTECTION for Amazon S3 data lakes

From zero-trust networking to automated malware scanning, these
technical guides walk through cloud-native security step-by-step.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW CLICKFIX ATTACK TARGETS CRYPTO WALLETS AND 25+ BROWSERS WITH
INFOSTEALER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An evolved ClickFix campaign uses fake CAPTCHA pages to trick users
into executing PowerShell commands that download an infostealer via
the Donut shellcode loader, which runs entirely in memory using
VirtualAlloc and CreateThread to evade file-based detection. The
malware targets cryptocurrency wallets, including MetaMask and Exodus,
harvests credentials from over 25 browsers, and exfiltrates VPN
configurations, Steam accounts, and FTP credentials, while persisting
through RunMRU registry key modifications. Organizations should
monitor for suspicious PowerShell execution chains, block known C2
IPs, and note that Microsoft Defender detects the payload as
Behavior:Win32/SuspClickFix.C. 

 AI-ASSISTED THREAT ACTOR COMPROMISES 600+ FORTIGATE DEVICES IN 55
COUNTRIES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A Russian-speaking, financially motivated threat actor leveraged
commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 FortiGate
devices across 55 countries by targeting exposed management interfaces
and weak single-factor credentials, according to Amazon Threat
Intelligence. Post-exploitation activity included Active Directory
compromise, credential harvesting via pass-the-hash/pass-the-ticket
and NTLM relay attacks, and targeting Veeam Backup servers using
CVE-2023-27532 and CVE-2024-40711, consistent with pre-ransomware
operations. Organizations should immediately restrict exposure of the
FortiGate management interface, enforce MFA for all administrative and
VPN access, rotate SSL-VPN credentials, and isolate backup
infrastructure from general network access. 

 ATTACKERS HAVE 16-DIGIT CARD NUMBERS, EXPIRY DATES, BUT NOT NAMES.
NOW ORG GETS £500K FINE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The UK Court of Appeal has backed the ICO's £500k fine on DSG Retail
over a 2017 breach that exposed 5.6 million card details and data on
14 million people, even though attackers lacked cardholder names. The
ruling confirms that payment card numbers and expiry dates are
personal data from the controller's perspective, stresses jigsaw
identification risk, and strengthens regulators' ability to penalize
weak security in future cyberattacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI IN THE MIDDLE: TURNING WEB-BASED AI SERVICES INTO C2 PROXIES & THE
FUTURE OF AI-DRIVEN ATTACKS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI assistants with web-browsing capabilities, specifically Grok and
Microsoft Copilot, can be abused as covert C2 relays by using
anonymous web access to fetch attacker-controlled URLs and return
embedded commands, all without API keys or registered accounts. This
PoC uses a WebView2-based C++ implant to create a bidirectional
channel in which victim data is exfiltrated via URL query parameters
and commands are returned via AI-generated responses, with simple
encoding sufficient to bypass model-side safeguards. The research
outlines a near-term evolution toward AI-Driven malware where implants
shift from static logic to prompt-driven behavior, enabling
AI-assisted anti-sandbox detection, intelligent victim triage, and
targeted ransomware that prioritizes high-value files to evade
volume-based detection thresholds. 

 TESTING ACCESS TO AWS RESOURCES WITHOUT ANGERING THE PEOPLE THAT PAY
THE BILLS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post details a methodology for empirically verifying AWS
resource exposure without reading sensitive data or altering the
resource state. It employs four techniques: comparing unsigned and
signed requests, conducting metadata-only reads, performing no-op
operations like untagging nonexistent keys, and sending malformed
request probes that leverage AWS' sequence where authorization checks
occur before parameter validation. The "3-topic method" ensures probe
safety by testing identical changes across allowed, denied, and
nonexistent resources — if only denied and nonexistent targets
return 403 errors and allowed ones return 400, it confirms
authorization without executing the action. This method is implemented
in the open-source sns-buster tool for SNS and is adaptable to other
AWS services for CSPM, bug bounty, and IAM policy validation. 

 EBPF RING BUFFER VS PERF BUFFER (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Ring buffer, introduced in Linux 5.8, replaced the legacy perf buffer
as the recommended mechanism for kernel-to-userspace data transfer in
eBPF programs. It uses a single shared circular buffer across all CPUs
instead of per-CPU buffers, eliminating cross-CPU event ordering
complexity and reducing copy overhead. This article walks through both
implementations in C and Go using cilium/ebpf, demonstrating how the
ring buffer's reserve-and-submit model via bpf_ringbuf_reserve and
bpf_ringbuf_submit provides a simpler, higher-throughput path compared
to perf buffer's bpf_perf_event_output approach. For security tooling
built on eBPF tracing, the ring buffer is now the default choice for
structured event streaming from kernel-level monitors to usersp.

 CLOUDFLARE OUTAGE ON FEBRUARY 20, 2026 (11 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Cloudflare experienced a 6-hour outage after a cleanup sub-task in
its Addressing API queried with an empty `pending_delete` parameter,
causing the system to interpret all 4,306 BYOIP prefixes as queued for
deletion and systematically withdrawing ~1,100 BGP prefixes across
customer networks. The bug rendered services including Magic Transit,
Spectrum, and a subset of 1.1.1.1 unreachable. Recovery was
complicated by varying states of impact, where some customers lost
both prefix advertisements and service bindings. Cloudflare is
implementing circuit breakers for large-scale BGP withdrawal actions,
separating operational and configured state in the Addressing API, and
deploying health-mediated configuration snapshots as part of their
Code Orange: Fail Small initiative.

LINKS (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 English Wikipedia is banning Archive.today after discovering the site
used its CAPTCHA to DDoS a critic's blog and secretly altered archived
pages to smear him, undermining trust in its snapshots. Editors will
replace roughly 695,000 Archive.today links with alternatives like the
Internet Archive. 

 FBI SAYS ATM ‘JACKPOTTING' ATTACKS ARE ON THE RISE, AND NETTING
HACKERS MILLIONS IN STOLEN CASH (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 ATM jackpotting, first showcased by researcher Barnaby Jack, has
become a lucrative cybercrime, with over 700 attacks in 2025 netting
at least $20 million in cash. Criminals use physical access, generic
keys, and Ploutus malware to hijack Windows-based ATMs via XFS
software, directly commanding dispensers to spew banknotes without
touching customer accounts and often evading detection until long
after cash-out.
