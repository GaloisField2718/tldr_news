STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 MAGENTO CREDIT CARD STEALER DISGUISED IN AN `IMG` TAG (10 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Magecart is a credit card skimming malware that is sophisticated and
hard to detect as it hides in `img` tags using Base64 encoding. It can
seamlessly inject fake payment forms to steal card details, requiring
vigilant security measures and monitoring. 

 REVOLUTIONIZING SOFTWARE TESTING: INTRODUCING LLM-POWERED BUG
CATCHERS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mutation testing is the process by which automatic test cases are
programmatically created based on existing test cases to increase code
coverage. Meta created the Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH) system
to use LLMs to generate mutants to model realistic inputs. A developer
uses ACH by describing the types of bugs that they're concerned about,
ACH then generates a series of bugs and converts them into tests to
run. 

 HOW ADVERSARIES EXPLOIT UNMONITORED CLOUD REGIONS TO EVADE DETECTION
(7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers commonly exploit unused regions in cloud providers to
launch crypto miners, exfiltrate data, or deploy other payloads. This
post explores the various methods and permissions that attackers can
utilize in AWS, GCP, and Azure to enumerate or enable unused regions.
This post also provides recommended mitigations such as restricting
region usage, setting budget alerts, and conducting regular audits.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SAAS BREACHES SURGED 300% IN 2024, WITH ATTACKERS BREACHING CORE
SYSTEMS IN AS LITTLE AS 9 MINUTES (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Obsidian Security's SaaS Security Threat Report [11] draws from the
industry's largest SaaS breach data repository and direct involvement
in +150 incidents. The report reveals that traditional defenses are
failing against new SaaS attack patterns, where identities are the new
frontline. Read the full findings here [11] 

 MIRRORTAB (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 MirrorTab intercepts and sanitizes a browser session before it ever
reaches the customer's device eliminating the traditional client-side
attack surface by preventing raw code or sensitive data from being
exposed in the user's environment. 

 PASSKEY RAIDER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Passkey Raider is a Burp Suite extension designed to facilitate
comprehensive testing of Passkey systems.

 COMMON OAUTH VULNERABILITIES (12 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 This blog provides an overview of how OAuth 2 works with a focus on
outlining the different parties involved in a request. It outlines the
common flows that are used in OAuth applications such as Implicit
Flows, Authorization Code Flows, Client Credentials, Device
Authorization Flows, and Resource Owner Password Credentials Flows.
The post then provides common attacks and mitigations against these
flows. 

 UNDERSTANDING SAFETENSORS: A SECURE ALTERNATIVE TO PICKLE FOR ML
MODELS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Python Pickles are a binary format that is commonly used to
distribute ML models but is inherently insecure because arbitrary code
can be executed during deserialization. SafeTensors is a format that
was created to solve this issue by only storing metadata and numerical
tensors. SafeTensors binaries should always be preferred over Pickles
when available as in addition to the security benefits, they can also
be more performant. 

 $10 INFOSTEALERS ARE BREACHING CRITICAL US SECURITY: MILITARY AND
EVEN THE FBI HIT (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The article talks about how relatively inexpensive infostealer
malware, like boobytrapped PDFs, game mods, and pirated software, are
leading to compromises across the board, even in critical US
organizations like the Pentagon and the FBI. According to Hudson
Rock's report, over 30 million computers worldwide have been hit, with
one in five holding corporate credentials. The article includes a case
study on Honeywell and the US Navy and discusses the importance of
vigilance and training staff.
