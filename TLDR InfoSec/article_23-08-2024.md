ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 YOU PROBABLY WANT TO PATCH THIS CRITICAL GITHUB ENTERPRISE SERVER BUG
NOW (3 MINUTE READ) [5]

 HACKERS STEAL BANKING CREDENTIALS FROM IOS, ANDROID USERS VIA PWAS (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A new trend in phishing campaigns is to use progressive web apps
(PWAs) to trick victims into entering banking credentials. The
campaigns being tracked are using bogus notifications to update
banking apps or ads on social media to download a bank's application
to earn a promotion. The victim is then directed to a fake Google Play
or App Store page that downloads the PWA which mimics the official app
and steals the victim's credentials. The benefit of this method is
that attackers can bypass App Store or Play Store restrictions.

 C++ UNWIND EXCEPTION METADATA: A HIDDEN REVERSE ENGINEERING BONANZA
(14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post discusses how C++ compilers insert wind and unwind
metadata to ensure proper destructor calls during exceptions in C++
programs. Compilers invisibly insert special blocks to handle object
destruction when exceptions occur, even if control flow skips normal
destructor calls. Wind metadata provides valuable information for
analyzing constructors and destructor calls in C++ programs.
