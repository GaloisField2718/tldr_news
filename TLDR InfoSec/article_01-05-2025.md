 THREATLOCKER PATCH MANAGEMENT: SET IT UP, THEN ACTUALLY GO HOME ON
TIME (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Ever notice how "routine patching" somehow eats up entire weekends?
It doesn't have to be this way. ThreatLocker Patch Management [5]
identifies outdated applications and handles everything for you.

Here's how it works: ThreatLocker's Cyber Hero Team pre-tests every
update in a controlled environment [4] before deployment. Instead of
researching and testing patches yourself, you simply:

 	* Create policies based on specific machines, organizations, or
timing
 	* Maintain complete visibility with centralized reporting
 	* Automate the entire process while maintaining control

Want to see how ThreatLocker eliminates tedious patch management and
unexpected surprises, while keeping your network secure? Start with a

 SECURING THE MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post identifies four security components to address in MCP
servers: agent to MCP communication, MCP to tool/server connectivity,

agent when talking to servers. For securing the agent to MCP
communications, the post suggests an allowlist of LLM providers that
an MCP can be integrated with. It also suggests utilizing existing
security practices to secure MCP-to-tool communication and the supply
chain, as well as using OAuth to ensure the identities of both the
user and the agent.
