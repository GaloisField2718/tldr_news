 AWS SECURES AWS. EVERYTHING ELSE IS YOUR ATTACK SURFACE. (SPONSOR) 
[4] 

 AWS-native tools protect what's inside AWS. But modern attacks move
across identity, SaaS, on-prem, and other clouds, before and after
they ever touch AWS.

VECTRA AI DELIVERS HIGH-FIDELITY BEHAVIORAL THREAT DETECTION AND
AUTOMATED RESPONSE IN AWS AT RUNTIME. NO NOISE. JUST ACTION.

AWS customers like KPMG, Under Armour, and many government
organizations use Vectra AI to:

	* Cut false positives by up to 85%
	* Investigate threats 5X faster with full attack path context
	* Detect hybrid attacks in real time 

Lower risk. Higher ROI. Less analyst burnout.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ILLINOIS HEALTH DEPARTMENT EXPOSED OVER 700,000 RESIDENTS' PERSONAL
DATA FOR YEARS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Illinois' Department of Human Services left an internal mapping site
publicly accessible for more than four years, exposing data on over
700,000 people receiving state benefits. The leak revealed addresses,
case numbers, demographic details for Medicaid and Medicare Savings
Program recipients, and names and case information for tens of
thousands of individuals receiving rehabilitation services. 

 ESA CALLS COPS AS CRIMS LIFT OFF 500 GB OF FILES, SAY SECURITY BLACK
HOLE STILL OPEN (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The European Space Agency faces a new breach after Scattered/Shiny
Lapsus$ Hunters claimed to have stolen 500 GB of highly sensitive
operational, spacecraft, and contractor data from ESA systems,
including information on missions involving partners such as SpaceX
and Airbus. The attackers say their access remains open. The ESA has
referred the case for a criminal inquiry amid a history of prior
security incidents dating back to 2011. 

 CRITICAL JSPDF FLAWS LETS HACKERS STEAL SECRETS VIA GENERATED PDFS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The popular jsPDF library is vulnerable to a local file inclusion and
path traversal attack that can allow attackers to steal secrets. The
flaw allows attackers to pass unsanitized paths directly to the
loadFile function or any functions that call it. The vulnerability was
fixed in version 4.0.0, but it may not be comprehensive on Node 20 and
earlier.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DECODING THE GITHUB RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NPM MAINTAINERS (13 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Following recent npm supply chain attacks, GitHub's hardening
guidance centers on three controls: adopting Trusted Publishing
Framework (OIDC-based short-lived credentials instead of long-lived
tokens), enforcing 2FA for all publishing operations, and using
WebAuthn/passkeys instead of TOTP for phishing-resistant
authentication. npm deprecated new TOTP setups in October and disabled
legacy tokens in November, requiring maintainers to use granular
access tokens with expiration for CI/CD automation. Maintainers should
configure trusted publisher relationships in package settings, enable
2FA across all sensitive operations, and enroll WebAuthn
authenticators while maintaining repository access controls. 

 DO SMART PEOPLE EVER SAY THEY'RE SMART? (SMARTERTOOLS SMARTERMAIL
PRE-AUTH RCE CVE-2025-52691) (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A critical pre-auth remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-52691) in
SmarterTools SmarterMail, a business email and collaboration server
for Windows and Linux, arises from an unauthenticated file upload
endpoint that accepts attacker-controlled parameters. It includes a
GUID used to construct file paths, enabling arbitrary file writes via
path traversal and by crafting a multipart/form-data request with
specific context and contextData values. With a malicious file, an
attacker can place a web shell in the webroot and gain full remote
code execution. 

 THE LOG RINGS DON'T LIE: HISTORICAL ENUMERATION IN PLAIN SIGHT (12
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Logs are an essential tool for defenders to monitor for breaches and
investigate incidents. However, they can also be a valuable
enumeration tool for attackers. This article provides a comprehensive
overview of how attackers can abuse logs for enumeration in AWS,
Azure, and GCP. Security teams should treat logs with care and enforce
the principle of least privilege where possible.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AN ACTIVE INCIDENT IS THE WORST TIME TO STITCH TOGETHER LOG DATA
(SPONSOR) [12] 

 You don't want to deal with data visibility nightmares to understand
if a threat is real. Sumo Logic unifies AWS, GCP, Azure, and 450+
other tools into a single platform - powered by multi-agent AI
[13] that surfaces root causes, prioritizes key events, and guides
analysts through resolution. Read the Gartner Critical Capabilities
report [14] to learn how Sumo Logic compares to other SIEM
competitors. 

 BLACKBIRD.AI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Blackbird.AI provides an AI-powered narrative intelligence platform
that helps organizations detect, analyze, and respond to harmful or
misleading online narratives and influence campaigns that threaten
reputation, operations, and security. 

 PQC NETWORK SCANNER (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 The PQC Network Scanner is a quantum-focused network assessment tool
that scans TLS/SSL certificates across environments to identify
systems vulnerable to future quantum attacks. 

 OGHIDRA (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 OGhidra bridges LLMs via Ollama with Ghidra to enable AI-driven
binary analysis through natural language.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GO.SUM IS NOT A LOCKFILE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Go's go.sum file is not a lockfile and has no effect on version
resolution—it's purely a local cache for the Go Checksum Database to
ensure cryptographic integrity. Developers should use go.mod for
dependency analysis, which, since Go 1.17, lists all transitive
dependencies with exact versions and functions as both a manifest and
lockfile. This design eliminates diamond dependency conflicts and
prevents automatic upgrades to potentially compromised dependency
versions. 

 KERNEL BUGS HIDE FOR 2 YEARS ON AVERAGE. SOME HIDE FOR 20 (18 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Analysis of 125,183 Linux kernel bugs with Fixes: tags revealed an
average bug lifetime of 2.1 years, with race conditions averaging 5.1
years, and the longest-lived bug persisted for 20.7 years. Detection
rates improved dramatically, from 0% bugs found within one year in
2010 to 69% in 2022, driven by tools such as Syzkaller and kernel
sanitizers. The VulnBERT model achieved 92.2% recall and a 1.2%
false-positive rate by combining CodeBERT embeddings with 51
handcrafted features targeting patterns such as unbalanced refcounts
and missing NULL checks. 

 CHATGPT FALLS TO NEW DATA-PILFERING ATTACK AS A VICIOUS CYCLE IN AI
CONTINUES (4 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Security researchers at Radware show how a new “ZombieAgent”
attack revives a previously blocked ChatGPT data‑exfiltration
technique by tweaking prompts to bypass URL restrictions and leak
information character by character. Indirect prompt injection and weak
separation between user instructions and embedded content keep LLM
agents vulnerable, forcing vendors into an endless patch-and-bypass
cycle rather than a fundamental fix.

 WHY WE'RE TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST SERPAPI'S UNLAWFUL SCRAPING (1
MINUTE READ) [21] 

 Google filed a lawsuit against SerpApi for circumventing security
measures through bot networks, cloaking techniques, and fake crawler
identities to scrape and resell copyrighted content from search
results. 

 MAJOR DATA BREACH HITS COMPANY OPERATING 150 GAS STATIONS IN THE US
(2 MINUTE READ) [22]

gas stations, disclosed a September 2025 breach exposing SSNs,
financial data, and government IDs of 377,000+ individuals.

ON SELF-HOSTED INSTANCES (4 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 Cybersecurity researchers reveal 11 critical vulnerabilities in
Coolify, a popular self‑hosting platform, that enable authenticated
low‑privileged users to achieve root command execution, escape
containers, and even obtain the server's root SSH key, potentially
compromising entire infrastructures.
