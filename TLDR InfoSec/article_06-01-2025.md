 WE TESTED 13 WAF SOLUTIONS IN REAL-WORLD CONDITIONS. HERE'S WHAT WE
FOUND (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Security researchers from Check Point's open-appsec tested the
efficacy of several leading WAF solutions using a comprehensive
dataset: 1,040,242 legitimate HTTP requests from 692 real websites
[4], and 73,924 malicious payloads from common attack vectors.

Based on these tests, they ranked each solution's true positive rate
— cases where it detected and blocked malicious requests —
compared with false positive cases where the solution blocked
legitimate requests.

→ See the full scores and test data [4] for leading WAF solutions
from Azure, AWS, Cloudflare, Imperva, and others on the open-appsec
blog [4].
