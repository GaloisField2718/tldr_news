ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FINTECH FIRM MARQUIS ALERTS DOZENS OF US BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS OF A
DATA BREACH AFTER RANSOMWARE ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Marquis, a Texas-based fintech that provides marketing and compliance
services to over 700 US banks and credit unions, suffered a ransomware
attack on August 14 that exploited a zero-day vulnerability in
SonicWall. Attackers stole sensitive customer data, including names,
contact details, financial account numbers, and Social Security
numbers, impacting at least 400,000 people so far. The total is
expected to grow as more state notifications are filed. 

 REACT2SHELL: IN-THE-WILD EXPLOITATION EXPECTED FOR CRITICAL REACT
VULNERABILITY (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A critical flaw in React 19, dubbed React2Shell, allows attackers to
execute code remotely on applications that use newer server-side
features and common frameworks. Many cloud environments are reportedly
exposed. Vendors are already shipping detection and protection rules. 

 FREEDOM MOBILE DISCLOSES DATA BREACH EXPOSING CUSTOMER DATA (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Freedom Mobile, Canada's fourth-largest wireless carrier, disclosed a
data breach impacting an undisclosed number of customers. The breached
data includes first and last names, home addresses, dates of birth,
home and/or cell phone numbers, and Freedom Mobile account numbers.
The data was breached via the account of a subcontractor. Ransomware
was not involved.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EVALUATING AI AGENTS IN SECURITY OPERATIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Cotool tested an AI agent's ability to solve security operations
tasks using the Splunk BOTSv3 dataset and frontier models from Claude,
OpenAI, and Gemini. Cotool found that while GPT-5.1 and Opus 4.5
achieved the top accuracy at 63%, Opus was 3x more expensive than
GPT-5.1 but also completed tasks in half the wall-clock time of any
other model. The Gemini models performed notably poorly on the tasks
and failed to complete several tasks. 

 THE EXPLOITATION OF LEGITIMATE REMOTE ACCESS TOOLS IN MODERN
RANSOMWARE CAMPAIGNS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Ransomware operators often use remote access tools such as AnyDesk
and UltraViewer to maintain persistence, execute remote tasks, and
transfer files while avoiding detection. Their typical attack involves
using stolen credentials to compromise an employee, then either
hijacking existing tools or installing legitimate remote access
software, followed by establishing persistence, escalating privileges,
and disabling security tools. Subsequently, they deploy payloads, move
laterally within the network, and finally execute their ransomware
attack. 

 SMILE, YOU'RE ON CAMERA: A LIVE STREAM FROM INSIDE LAZARUS GROUP'S IT
WORKERS SCHEME (20 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers trapped North Korean operatives from Lazarus Group's
Famous Chollima division inside an extended ANY.RUN sandbox
environments, documenting their full operational workflow for
infiltrating Western companies as remote IT workers. The operators
recruit developers via GitHub spam. They offer 20-35% salary cuts in
exchange for using victims' identities and laptops for job
applications, relying on AI interview tools, AstrillVPN, and remote
access software rather than malware. Poor operational security allowed
researchers to delay, monitor, and ultimately expose the scheme
targeting the finance, crypto, and healthcare sectors.

MISCELLANEOUS

 GOLDFACTORY HITS SOUTHEAST ASIA WITH MODIFIED BANKING APPS DRIVING
11,000+ INFECTIONS (7 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GoldFactory is a cybercrime group targeting Android users in
Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam with tampered banking apps that still
appear legitimate while secretly installing remote-access malware. The
malware abuses accessibility services and hooking frameworks to bypass
security checks, hide its presence, control devices in real time, and
steal banking data at scale. At least 11,000 infections have been
identified so far. 

 ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES CHINESE ONLINE RETAILER TEMU OVER DATA
THEFT CLAIMS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has joined several other states
in suing Temu and its parent company over allegations that the online
retailer is stealing customers' data. Mayes stated that the app
collects a startling amount of data without users' consent,
specifically citing GPS location and a list of other apps on users'
phones. Mayes also expressed concerns over the quality of products
sold on Temu and whether the retailer has “ripped off” other
businesses. 

 FRONTIER AI MODELS DEMONSTRATE HUMAN-LEVEL CAPABILITY IN SMART
CONTRACT EXPLOITS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic evaluated ten frontier models on a dataset of 405
historical smart contract exploits and found that the agents produced
working attacks against 207 of them, totaling $550M in simulated
stolen funds. Anthropic measured the model's current capabilities by
plotting each model's total exploit revenue against its release date.
The models also discovered two previously undisclosed zero-days.
