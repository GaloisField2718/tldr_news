 Achieving compliance with SOC 2 and ISO 27001 is crucial for
unlocking growth and establishing customer trust, but it can be
time-intensive and costly.

Join Vanta on September 24 for a live demo [4] of compliance
automation. The team will walk you through the Vanta platform and
answer your questions in real time. During this session, you will
learn:

 	* Why compliance is essential for your business
 	* How Vanta's automation can help you achieve it quickly

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 GITLAB WARNS OF CRITICAL PIPELINE EXECUTION VULNERABILITY (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 GitLab has released a bulletin urging CE and EE users to update their
installation to fix a critical vulnerability. The vulnerability allows
RCE via environment stop action jobs. The fix also addresses four
other high severity vulnerabilities that can be exploited to achieve
RCE. 

 CLEVER 'GITHUB SCANNER' CAMPAIGN ABUSING REPOS TO PUSH MALWARE (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A sneaky campaign on GitHub is tricking users into visiting a fake
domain and installing Windows malware by falsely reporting security
vulnerabilities. Users are receiving convincing email alerts from
legitimate GitHub addresses, leading to the spread of malicious
software. Threat actors are using GitHub's "Issues" feature to
distribute malware through open-source repositories, highlighting the
platform's vulnerability to abuse.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A SAAS PROVIDER'S GUIDE TO SECURELY INTEGRATING WITH CUSTOMERS' AWS
ACCOUNTS (9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SaaS providers often need to integrate with customers' AWS
environments to perform a variety of tasks such as cost optimization
or CSPM. The basics that a provider can do are to use IAM Roles with
ExternalIDs instead of IAM users and to audit and minimize permissions
that your role requires. Some paved roads and guardrails that
providers can then take would be to provide CloudFormation templates
and/or a Terraform provider as well as refusing to assume an overly
permissive role. Finally, providers should treat their integrations as
crown jewels and consider using defense-in-depth models such as
bastion accounts and restricting the customer's trust boundary to a
single role instead of a full account. 

 HOW CLOUDFLARE IS HELPING DOMAIN OWNERS WITH THE UPCOMING ENTRUST CA
DISTRUST BY CHROME AND MOZILLA (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Entrust is partnering with SSL.com to issue trusted certificates and
prevent disruptions as Chrome and Mozilla plan to stop trusting its
TLS certificates soon due to compliance concerns. Cloudflare will now
support SSL.com certificates for automatic issuance and renewal,
making it easier for domain owners.

 CYBERSECURITY TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION CYCLE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
STARTUPS AND SECURITY TEAMS (7 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Security teams can be classified into three categories: mature and
engineering-focused teams, mature but not engineering-focused teams,
and less mature teams or organizations that lack resources. Mature and
engineering-focused teams will look to build their own tools, become
design partners with early stage startups, and only look to buy
tooling once it becomes commodified. Mature but not
engineering-focused teams will often buy tooling from early-stage
startups. Less mature teams will primarily wait for larger companies
to adopt new tooling and features to reduce the amount of products
they pay for. Startups need to be aware of these trends as they are
the inverse of typical strategies. Security teams need to consider
this cycle when deciding to build vs buy tooling. 

 CROWDSTRIKE EX-EMPLOYEES: ‚ÄòQUALITY CONTROL WAS NOT PART OF THE
PROCESS' (4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Semafor interviewed 24 former CrowdStrike employees in the wake of
the outage this past July. The employees detailed working conditions
that prioritized speed above all else and omitted quality control.
CrowdStrike disputes these claims and says that these were disgruntled
former employees who are not reputable. 

 POLICY LANGUAGE SECURITY COMPARISON (65 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AWS engaged Trail of Bits to evaluate three major authorization and
access management policy languages: Cedar, Rego, and OpenFGA. Trail of
Bits evaluated sixteen threat scenarios and grouped them by attack
surface and mitigation similarity. Cedar's predictable evaluation
model protects against DoS from users and the formalized semantics,
testing, and typing system prevent language misuse and mis-evaluation,
but data ingestion and engineering may cause complexities. Rego
provides a flexible policy language which can make it easier to use
but also may lead to language misuse, mis-evaluation, or performance
considerations. OpenFGA provides a declarative language for mapping
ReBAC constraints, which can simplify policy writing, but it relies on
external attribute lists and can lead to unpredictable performance.
The language also features mitigations for threats related to policy
extension and replacement.
