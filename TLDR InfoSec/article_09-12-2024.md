 PRACTICAL GUIDE TO CLOUD THREAT DETECTION, INVESTIGATION, AND
RESPONSE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 For security teams, the cloud is both a blessing and a curse.
Abundant telemetry allows for unparalleled visibility and control, but
traditional security tools (like SIEM and EDR) fall short in
addressing the complexities and scale of cloud infrastructure.

That's why a new category of tools is emerging – Cloud Detection and
Response (CDR) [4] - bringing the “assume-breach” mindset into the
cloud.

CDR tools are purpose-built to help organizations detect, investigate,
and respond to threats in cloud environments.

This practical guide covers:

 	* What is Cloud Detection and Response (CDR)
 	* Why choose CDR over traditional SecOps tools
 	* How CDR fits into the SOC workflow
 	* Core capabilities of CDR solutions

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SOLANA WEB3.JS LIBRARY BACKDOORED TO STEAL PRIVATE KEYS (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 The Solana web3.js SDK was backdoored by a malicious commit for
roughly 5 hours on December 2. The backdoor was hidden in a new
addToQueue function which sent the user's private key in seemingly
benign headers to an attacker-controlled server. Calls to the function
were then placed in strategic locations in the key generation and
loading process. The developers urge any developers who think they
might have been compromised to rotate their keys. 

 ATRIUM HEALTH DATA BREACH IMPACTS 585,000 PEOPLE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Atrium Health reported a data breach affecting 585,000 individuals
due to online tracking technologies on its patient portal between 2015
and 2019. Potential personal information may have been shared with
third parties like Google and Facebook, though no financial data was
compromised. 

 ULTRALYTICS AI LIBRARY COMPROMISED: CRYPTOCURRENCY MINER FOUND IN
PYPI VERSIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Two versions of the Ultralytics AI library were compromised to
deliver a cryptocurrency miner, leading to a spike in CPU usage for
users. The malicious code injection occurred in the PyPI deployment
workflow, allowing unauthorized modifications to be inserted after the
code review step. Users are advised to update to the latest version of
the library to avoid potential security risks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANDROID'S CVE-2020-0401 (PACKAGEMANAGERSERVICE) (6 MINUTE READ) 

 This blog post dives into CVE-2020-0401 after an old OnePlus phone
sparked curiosity about the vulnerability. The vulnerability allows
malicious apps to register as installers without proper permissions so
the author tried to exploit it. 

 PAVED ROADS? SECURE-BY-DESIGN? MORE BUZZWORDS??? (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Paved roads is a common security buzzword that refers to the process
of creating a standardized path for common security pitfalls. Security
reviews should look to identify common pain points across different
reviews as candidates for paved roads and then work with teams that
will pioneer the paved path. Following this methodology, full classes
of vulnerabilities can be fixed at scale as opposed to individually as
they appear in individual reviews. 

 PISHI: COVERAGE GUIDED MACOS KEXT FUZZING (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This author provides a deep dive on macOS internals and their process
in building a KEXT fuzzer. The post begins by detailing the
difficulties of kernel-level binary instrumentation in macOS. The
author then describes how they came to decide on an architecture that
uses a custom-built trampoline to instrument basic blocks that were
identified in the Boot Kext Collection and then feed the coverage
results into the next iteration of the fuzzer.

 EUROCOPS TAKE DOWN 'SECURE' CRIMINAL CHAT SYSTEM KNOWN AS MATRIX (3
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 French and Dutch police dismantled the Matrix encrypted chat app used
by criminals, seizing 2.3 million messages about illegal activities
across 40 servers. The operation led to three arrests and exposed the

 LET'S TALK DENIAL OF WALLET (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Denial of Wallet attacks occur when an attacker makes use of cloud
services which charge based on usage to generate large bills for
victims. They can be caused by scaling traditional DDoS attacks or
other vectors such as cryptojacking or LLM hijacking. This is the
first post in a series on Denial of Wallet attacks and mitigations to
protect against them.

(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A new zero-day vulnerability in Windows lets attackers steal NTLM
credentials by tricking users into viewing a malicious file in Windows
Explorer. The issue affects various Windows versions, from Windows 7
to Windows 11. An unofficial patch is available from the 0patch team
until Microsoft releases an official fix.

 THE HIDDEN CHALLENGES OF AUTOMATING SECRETS ROTATION: WHY AUTOMATIC
CREDENTIAL ROTATION ISN'T A ONE-CLICK SOLUTION (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 While automatic secrets rotation is a desirable goal, it requires
significant organizational maturity in secrets management, proper
infrastructure, and careful planning rather than being a simple
one-click solution, as credential rotation involves complex processes
that can impact production systems if not handled correctly.
