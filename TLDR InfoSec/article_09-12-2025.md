 YOUR FIREWALL PROTECTS THE OFFICE. WHO PROTECTS THE AIRPORT, COFFEE
SHOP, AND HOME OFFICE? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Old-school firewalls are built for a perimeter that no longer exists.
Work happening outside the corporate network is just a fact - but that
doesn't mean you should give up on security.

DNSFilter [4] stops malicious connections before they hit the endpoint
- blocking malware, questionable content, and productivity drains.
Learn how it works with the FREE 43-page eBook, Conversational
Content Filtering in a Hybrid Workforce [4], covering:

→ The true cost of unregulated internet access (legal, productivity,
security)

→ How to build precise, role-based policies without strangling
productivity

→ Zero-friction integration with your existing security stack

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 BARTS HEALTH NHS CONFIRMS CL0P RANSOMWARE BEHIND DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Barts Health NHS Trust confirmed that the Cl0p ransomware group
exfiltrated 241 GB of data from invoice databases after exploiting a
vulnerability in Oracle E-Business Suite. The breach occurred in
August but remained undetected until data surfaced on leak sites in
November. Stolen data included patient billing information, former
staff salary records, and supplier payment details. Clinical systems
remained unaffected. Oracle has since patched the exploited flaw. The
incident highlights the continued targeting of healthcare
organizations through enterprise software vulnerabilities. 

 CVE-2025-66516: MAXIMUM-SEVERITY VULNERABILITY IN APACHE TIKA COULD
LEAD TO XML EXTERNAL ENTITY INJECTION ATTACK (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A newly disclosed XXE vulnerability, CVE-2025-66516, affects several
Apache Tika components and allows attackers to embed malicious XFA
content in PDFs, potentially exposing sensitive server files or
enabling remote code execution. Upgrade all affected Tika modules
ASAP. 

 MALICIOUS VSCODE EXTENSIONS ON MICROSOFT'S REGISTRY DROP INFOSTEALERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers have discovered two malicious extensions for VSCode that
masquerade as a theme and an AI assistant, respectively, to drop
infostealers. The extensions run a script that uses curl to download a
malicious DLL, which executes as runtime.dll. The infostealers collect
running processes, clipboard content, WiFi credentials, system
information, screenshots, lists of installed programs, cookies from
Chrome and Edge browsers, and cryptocurrency wallet passwords and
credentials.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 OFFENSIVE SECURITY TAKES CENTER STAGE IN THE AI ERA (8 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 CISOs are increasingly adopting comprehensive offensive security
programs as AI-enabled threats create more sophisticated attack
patterns that traditional scanning cannot detect. OffSec maturity
spans from basic vulnerability management through penetration testing
to advanced threat hunting and security tool evasion testing.
Automation and AI have lowered barriers to implementation. Offensive
and defensive programs must work in concert rather than in isolation,
with OffSec providing empirical risk validation and data-driven
evidence for security investments. 

 HOW CAN RETAILERS CYBER-PREPARE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE TIME OF THE
YEAR? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Holiday shopping periods create compressed attack windows where
bot-driven credential stuffing, account takeover, and automated fraud
campaigns intensify against retail systems running at peak capacity
with reduced staff. Layered defenses should include adaptive MFA for
risky transactions, bot management with device fingerprinting,
credential-stuffing detection, and blocking passwords against known
breach datasets. Organizations should also test authentication
failover procedures and implement strict third-party access controls,
as vendor credential compromise remains a primary attack vector. 

 REACT2SHELL (CVE-2025-55182): DETECTION & MITIGATION GUIDE (5 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 React2Shell is a critical remote code execution flaw in React Server
Components and related Next.js setups that allows an attacker to send
a crafted HTTP request to a server-side function endpoint and execute
arbitrary code on the backend. Systems are especially at risk when
using React Server Functions with the use server directive or default
Next.js App Router configurations, which expose vulnerable endpoints
even in otherwise standard apps. The issue affects multiple React
server DOM packages and a wide range of Next.js 15 and 16 versions.
Fixed versions are already available. Upgrading these components is
the primary mitigation.

 ANDROID MALWARE FVNCBOT, SEEDSNATCHER, AND CLAYRAT GAIN STRONGER DATA
THEFT FEATURES (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Researchers disclosed three Android malware families with enhanced
capabilities: FvncBot targets Polish banking users with keylogging,
web-inject attacks, and hidden VNC; SeedSnatcher steals cryptocurrency
wallet seed phrases and 2FA codes via Telegram distribution; and an
upgraded ClayRat enables full device takeover through accessibility
services abuse. FvncBot uses the apk0day crypting service and
session-based installation to bypass Android 13+ restrictions, while
ClayRat spreads through 25 phishing domains impersonating YouTube and
Russian taxi apps. Organizations should monitor for accessibility
service abuse patterns and enforce sideloading restrictions to
mitigate these threats. 

 BLOCK ALL AI BROWSERS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE: GARTNER (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Gartner analysts have urged organizations to block AI-enabled
browsers, such as agentic and sidebar-based tools, because they send
sensitive browsing data to cloud backends and can autonomously act
within logged-in sessions, making them vulnerable to prompt injection,
phishing, and credential abuse. They worry staff could automate
mandatory tasks such as security training and misconfigure procurement
or travel bookings, and have recommended strict risk assessments,
tight controls, or outright bans for now. 

 GOOGLE DETAILS SECURITY MEASURES FOR CHROME'S AGENTIC FEATURES (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Chrome's upcoming AI “agentic” features will act on users' behalf
to complete tasks such as shopping or filling out forms, while also
reducing security risks. It uses separate models to check that planned
actions align with user goals and to vet URLs, limits what page data
agents can read or modify, and asks for explicit permission before
accessing sensitive sites, using passwords, or completing purchases.
