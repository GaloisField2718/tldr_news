most security reports are survey-based, Orca's findings are based on
data from billions of cloud assets scanned¬†by the Orca Cloud Security
Platform [5]. Read it to discover where the chinks in today's data
security armor really lie.

 5 STEPS FOR CREATING AN APPSEC PROGRAM (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This post lays out 5 steps to building an AppSec program. Start by
creating or updating application and infrastructure diagrams to engage
security partners and gain visibility into the attack surface.
Existing security tools should then be mapped to the diagrams. The
limitations of those tools should be explored and then repeatable
processes should be built around security. After a program reaches
this level of maturity, further projects such as secure libraries,
terraform modules, and DAST integrations can be pursued.
