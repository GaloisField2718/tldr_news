ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EXPRESSVPN USER DATA EXPOSED DUE TO BUG (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ExpressVPN disabled split tunneling on Windows clients to fix a bug
introduced in May 2022 which caused DNS requests to bypass its
servers. This bug exposed domain visits to ISPs when using split
tunneling with app-specific VPN routing. Though traffic stayed
encrypted, the DNS leak defeated privacy protections. 

 U.S. INTERNET LEAKED YEARS OF INTERNAL, CUSTOMER EMAILS (5 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 U.S. Internet‚Äôs 'Securence' email-providing division had a publicly
exposed webpage that listed every email of its 6,500 clients. The CEO
of the company stated that the exposure was caused by a mistake in an
Ansible playbook controlling the nginx config. U.S. Internet has not
commented on how long this misconfiguration was in place or why
appropriate controls were not in place to detect or prevent the
misconfiguration.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO WEAPONIZE LLMS TO AUTO-HIJACK WEBSITES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 LLMs can autonomously hack websites when paired with tools enabling
system interaction. Despite safety efforts, LLMs weaponized without
human guidance can compromise vulnerable websites through automated
browsing and planning. Weaponized LLMs can break into buggy web apps
without knowledge of vulnerabilities, showing that they can hack
without oversight.
