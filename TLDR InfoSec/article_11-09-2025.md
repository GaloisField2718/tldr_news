ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FROM MOSTERERAT TO CLICKFIX: NEW MALWARE CAMPAIGNS HIGHLIGHT RISING
AI AND PHISHING RISKS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Fortinet researchers have disclosed a sophisticated phishing campaign
delivering MostereRAT, a banking malware-turned-RAT that uses the
obscure Easy Programming Language (EPL), disables Windows security
mechanisms, and deploys remote access tools like AnyDesk and TightVNC
to maintain persistent access on compromised systems. A separate
ClickFix campaign targets users searching for AnyDesk by serving fake
Cloudflare verification pages that ultimately deliver MetaStealer
through social engineering tactics involving Windows File Explorer and
malicious LNK files disguised as PDFs. Security researchers also
revealed a novel adaptation of ClickFix using CSS-based obfuscation to
weaponize AI summarizers through "prompt overdose" attacks that
overwhelm AI context windows to produce malicious step-by-step
instructions, demonstrating how threat actors are exploiting user
trust in AI-generated content. 

 SESSIONREAPER, UNAUTHENTICATED RCE IN MAGENTO & ADOBE COMMERCE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Adobe released an emergency patch for a critical (CVSS 9.1)
vulnerability in all versions of Adobe Commerce and Magento. The
vulnerability allows for customer account takeover as well as
unauthenticated remote code execution in some circumstances. The
attack combines a malicious session with a nested deserialization bug.


 CURSOR'S AUTORUN LETS HACKERS EXECUTE ARBITRARY CODE (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Cursor's AI-powered code editor ships with Workspace Trust disabled
by default, allowing malicious repositories to automatically execute
code through crafted ".vscode/tasks.json" files the moment a developer
opens a folder, without any user prompts or warnings. Attackers can
inject these malicious task files into public repositories, enabling
them to compromise developer machines and access sensitive data,
including API keys, cloud credentials, and SaaS sessions, simply
through the act of browsing a project. Unlike VS Code, which does not
auto-run tasks in default configurations, Cursor executes these tasks
immediately after opening a project folder, creating a significant
supply chain attack vector for the platform's one million users.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHEN AI NUKES YOUR DATABASE: THE DARK SIDE OF VIBE CODING (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A startup founder's production database was accidentally wiped by an
AI coding assistant in Replit, highlighting the dangers of "vibe
coding" - the practice of letting AI tools like GitHub Copilot
generate code from plain English prompts without proper review.
Research shows 45% of AI-generated code contains OWASP Top 10
vulnerabilities, with common issues including hardcoded secrets, weak
access controls, and hallucinated dependencies that don't exist or
contain security flaws. Security experts warn that "Shadow AI"
development bypasses traditional code review processes, requiring
organizations to treat AI-generated code like junior developer output
with strict scrutiny and governance controls. 

 HOW AN ATTACKER'S BLUNDER GAVE US A RARE LOOK INSIDE THEIR DAY-TO-DAY
OPERATIONS (14 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Huntress gained unprecedented insight into a threat actor's
operations when the attacker accidentally installed their EDR agent
after finding them through a Google ad while researching Bitdefender,
revealing extensive use of AI tools like Make.com for workflow
automation, searches for Evilginx instances, and systematic
reconnaissance targeting Nigerian banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.
The actor demonstrated sophisticated OPSEC with residential proxies
(LunaProxy), anti-detection browsers (Nstbrowser), and security tools
(Malwarebytes) while working 12 to 14-hour days conducting research,
crafting phishing messages using Google Translate, and accessing over
2,400 compromised identities. Browser history revealed their evolution
from manual processes to AI-assisted workflows, including automated
Telegram bot integration and the use of stolen cookies with tools like
ROADtools for Microsoft Entra token exploitation. 

 PWN MY RIDE: EXPLORING THE CARPLAY ATTACK SURFACE (6 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 Oligo exposes Apple CarPlay's security vulnerabilities, focusing on
CVE-2025-24132, a stack buffer overflow in the AirPlay protocol that
enables remote code execution with root privileges. They detail how
wireless CarPlay exposes vehicles to attacks, mainly because most cars
rely on weak Bluetooth pairing. Attackers can exploit poor
authentication to extract WiFi credentials and launch RCE attacks.
Although Apple patched this in the AirPlay SDK, most car manufacturers
haven't implemented these fixes, leaving many vehicles exposed.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AI NOTE-TAKERS ARE CREATING SHADOW IT (SPONSOR) [12] 

 When AI meeting tools quietly train on conversations and store
sensitive data without controls, the risks to data security multiply.
This free checklist from Fellow [12] gives IT and Ops leaders a clear
framework to assess vendors on privacy, security, and governance.
Before Shadow AI spreads inside your org, get the checklist to reduce
your risk. [12] 

 MFTOOL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 MFTool is a red team-oriented NTFS parser that bypasses Windows file
APIs by directly parsing on-disk Master File Table structures to
access locked, deleted, and hidden files. The tool can retrieve
sensitive files like SAM, SYSTEM, and pagefile.sys without opening
OS-level file handles, effectively circumventing Windows file access
controls while requiring administrative privileges. It supports
regex-based searches across entire volumes and maintains an encrypted
in-memory Master File Table (MFT) cache for stealthy file system
operations during red team engagements. 

 RF-SWIFT (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 RF-Swift is a revolutionary toolbox that transforms any computer into
a powerful RF testing laboratory without requiring a dedicated
operating system. Unlike traditional approaches that force you to
sacrifice your primary OS, RF-Swift brings containerized RF tools to
your existing environment. 

 AEGIS AI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 Aegis AI provides email security through reasoning agents, each of
which is a custom-built LLM tuned to a specific threat. Once the
orchestrating agent recognizes a threat or potential threat, it calls
other agents in the network, and these agents then run the analysis,
reason with each other, and respond to the orchestrating agent with a
verdict.

 GOOGLE MISLED USERS ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY AND NOW OWES THEM $425M, SAYS
COURT (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A court ordered Google to pay $425 million in a class action lawsuit
after finding it misled 98 million users about its "Web & App
Activity" privacy setting, which was supposed to stop data collection
but didn't prevent Google from gathering information through its
Firebase analytics system. Despite users thinking their activities
were private, Google continued collecting data from apps like Uber,
Venmo, and Instagram through a separate system, with internal
communications revealing Google was "intentionally vague" about data
collection practices to avoid alarming users. This adds to Google's
history of privacy violations, including recent settlements totaling
over $2 billion for misleading location tracking and incognito mode
practices. 

 THE US GOVERNMENT HAS NO IDEA HOW MANY CYBERSECURITY PROS IT EMPLOYS
(3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The US government lacks accurate data on the number of cybersecurity
workers and contractors it employs, due to the messy, incomplete, and
unreliable data across agencies. The GAO found that most departments
lack standardized reporting and quality controls, and efforts to fix
the situation are stalled, leaving workforce planning and effective
cybersecurity policy undermined. 

 FORMER WHATSAPP SECURITY BOSS IN LAWSUIT LIKENS META'S CULTURE TO A
“CULT” (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Meta's ex-WhatsApp security chief, Attaullah Baig, has sued back,
claiming the company ignored and concealed major privacy flaws,
allowed over 1,500 engineers uncontrolled data access, and failed to
secure and track user data. He asserts Meta retaliated against him for
whistleblowing, while Meta counters that he performed poorly and
misrepresented ongoing efforts to improve security.
