 A FEW NOTES ON AWS NITRO ENCLAVES: ATTACK SURFACE (7 MINUTE READ) [8]


 This post presents an in-depth overview of the attack surface of AWS
Nitro Enclaves, a confidential computing solution for EC2. Developers
should treat Nitro enclaves as a single trust zone and implement
end-to-end security practices. They should also seek to mitigate side
channel attacks through proper CPU allocation and using constant-time
processing. Developers should verify that the enclave is using
kvm-clock for timing and nsm-hwrng for entropy. It is critical to
implement robust attestation verification practices. 

 AWS LETSENCRYPT LAMBDA OR WHY I WROTE A CUSTOM TLS PROVIDER FOR AWS
USING OPENTOFU AND GO (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This developer wrote a Lambda function that utilizes LetsEncrypt to
create and renew TLS certificates that are more portable without
relying on AWS Certificate Manager. The function takes in an event
from a manual run or Event Bridge, requests a certificate from
LetsEncrypt, creates a new TXT record in Route53 if needed for
verification, and then optionally stores it in AWS Secrets Manager.
The source code for the Lambda function and OpenTofu/Terraform module
is provided.
