ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SAP FIXED A MAXIMUM SEVERITY FLAW IN SQL ANYWHERE MONITOR (3 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 SAP patched 19 vulnerabilities in November, including CVE-2025-42890
(CVSS 10/10), a critical hardcoded credentials flaw in SQL Anywhere
Monitor (Non-GUI) that enabled arbitrary code execution with complete
system compromise. Additional critical fixes include CVE-2025-42887
(CVSS 9.9) in SAP Solution Manager, which addresses code injection via
missing input sanitization, and an update to CVE-2025-42944 that
addresses insecure deserialization in SAP NetWeaver AS Java.
Organizations should immediately discontinue SQL Anywhere Monitor
usage, delete all monitor database instances, and apply patches across
affected SAP products. No evidence of active exploitation has been
reported. 

 AMAZON DISCOVERS APT EXPLOITING CISCO AND CITRIX ZERO-DAYS (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Amazon's threat intelligence team discovered an APT exploiting
zero-day vulnerabilities CVE-2025-20337 in Cisco Identity Service
Engine (pre-authentication RCE via deserialization) and CVE-2025-5777
in Citrix systems. The attacks were detected via MadPot honeypots
before public disclosure. The threat actor deployed a custom Java web
shell named IdentityAuditAction, which features in-memory operation,
Java reflection for thread injection, DES encryption with non-standard
Base64 encoding, and HTTP header-based authentication requiring
specific knowledge to access. Organizations should immediately patch
affected Cisco ISE and Citrix NetScaler systems, implement firewall
restrictions on management portal access, deploy defense-in-depth
strategies for identity infrastructure, and monitor for anomalous
behavior patterns in authentication systems even when properly
configured. 

 SYNOLOGY FIXES BEESTATION ZERO-DAYS DEMOED AT PWN2OWN IRELAND (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Synology has fixed a critical vulnerability in its BeeStation OS,
which powers Synology NAS devices, discovered by researchers at
Pwn2Own Ireland. A buffer overflow causes the vulnerability and can
result in remote code execution.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NO LEAK, NO PROBLEM - BYPASSING ASLR WITH A ROP CHAIN TO GAIN RCE (10
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A showcase on how to exploit a modern ARM-based IoT device,
specifically a network camera, by bypassing Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution
(RCE) using a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) chain. This approach
cleverly bypasses ASLR, a memory protection mechanism designed to
block exploit attempts, allowing remote code execution without
requiring the leakage of addresses. By manipulating writable memory
and leveraging known offsets, the attacker can execute commands on the
device, illustrating how gaps in embedded device security can be
exploited even with mitigations in place. 

 ACTIVE DIRECTORY UNDER SIEGE: WHY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS
STRONGER SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Active Directory remains the authentication backbone for 90% of
Fortune 1000 companies, with attackers exploiting golden ticket
attacks, DCSync privilege escalation, Kerberoasting, and compromised
credentials (involved in 88% of breaches per Verizon DBIR) to gain
network-wide control, as demonstrated by the 2024 Change Healthcare
breach, where MFA absence enabled full AD compromise. Critical
vulnerabilities include weak passwords, service accounts with
excessive permissions and non-expiring credentials, cached admin
credentials in memory, legacy NTLM protocol exploitation, and hybrid
environment complexity, creating visibility gaps between on-premises
and cloud security teams. Implement layered defenses, including
continuous credential monitoring against breach databases (blocking
4B+ compromised passwords), privileged access management with
just-in-time elevation, zero-trust conditional access with MFA for all
privileged accounts, continuous AD change monitoring for suspicious
patterns, and aggressive patching of domain controllers within days of
security updates. 

 TWO SCENARIO THREAT MODELING (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many people feel intimidated by the number of potential scenarios and
never perform threat modeling. Instead, many of the insights of a
threat modeling exercise can be garnered by considering only a worst
case scenario and a likely but impactful scenario. Security teams
should devise detailed story-driven scenarios for these exercises and
then proceed in either an informal or formal threat modeling exercise.
