 OPEN-SOURCE ZERO TRUST NETWORKING (SPONSOR) [4] 

 There‚Äôs a ton of buzz around Zero Trust Networking [5]. Most of it
is driven by security vendors targeting large enterprises with
contracts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
But what about smaller companies without big budgets for expensive
network security solutions?

The recent release of NetBird [6] brings Zero Trust to the world of
open source network security.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MISCONFIGURED FIREBASE INSTANCES LEAKED 19 MILLION PLAINTEXT
PASSWORDS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Three cybersecurity researchers found nearly 19 million plaintext
passwords exposed on the internet due to misconfigured Firebase
instances. They scanned over five million domains and identified 916
vulnerable websites. These instances revealed more than 125 million
sensitive user records that included emails, names, passwords, phone
numbers, and bank details. 

 BYPASSING USBGUARD ON LINUX (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 USBGuard on Linux can be bypassed when not configured with specific
vendor and product IDs, allowing attackers to circumvent USB
authorization policies. Attackers can present devices as innocuous HID
or hub devices while actually being malicious by exploiting the
kernel's matching process. 

 APEX LEGENDS REGIONAL FINALISTS HACKED MID-MATCH (2 MINUTE READ) [11]


 The North American finals of the Apex Legends Global Series was
postponed after two players had their computers hacked and cheats
added to their game. Players are being advised to secure all accounts
with MFA and perform a clean reinstall of their OS due to an RCE
vulnerability being actively exploited in the game or anti-cheat
software.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GAINING KERNEL CODE EXECUTION ON AN MTE-ENABLED PIXEL 8 (22 MINUTE
READ) [12] 

 This blog post describes a logic bug in the memory management unit of
the ARM Mali GPU used in Pixel 8 phones that can be used to bypass
Memory Tagging Extension (MTE). This vulnerability, GHSL-2023-005, is
related to GPU memory handling, particularly JIT memory, and how it is
managed by the kbase_context in the Mali GPU driver. Attackers can
cause inconsistencies in GPU memory mapping by exploiting the race
window between memory growth triggers. 

 HOW TO EMULATE A RANSOMWARE ATTACK (9 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 This blog post delves into how SpecterInsight‚Äôs ransomware
emulation capability functions and provides insights into the
operational flow of a full emulated ransomware deployment kill chain.
It details the tools used, the ransomware deployment process, ethical
considerations, defense evasion techniques, obfuscation methods in
PowerShell and C#, and the user prompt element in the ransom message.
It also outlines the responsibilities of the encrypter, loader, ransom
message/decrypter, and deployment script components in orchestrating
the kill chain. 

 BEYONDCORP AND THE LONG TAIL OF ZERO TRUST (10 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This article discusses the challenges faced by Alphabet in migrating
to a BeyondCorp-style architecture, specifically the long tail of
difficult use cases where gaps in tooling, available data, management
buy-in, or specialized technical knowledge historically prevented
users from migrating to a zero-trust model. The article also describes
the processes, tools, and solutions created to handle these use cases
and provides lessons learned to help others address the long tail of
migration to a BeyondCorp-style architecture.
