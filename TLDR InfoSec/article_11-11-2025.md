ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 DATA LEAK EXPOSES CHINESE STATE-SPONSORED CYBER ARSENAL AND TARGET
DATABASE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Threat actors have stolen a massive amount of data from the Chinese
cybersecurity firm Knownsec. The breach includes specifications for
cyber weapons, source code for proprietary hacking tools, operational
details of government collaborations, and an extensive list of foreign
surveillance targets. A spreadsheet within the breach details 80
overseas targets allegedly compromised by Knownsec operatives. 

 IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION HANDLING IN THE AMAZON WORKSPACES CLIENT FOR
LINUX (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Amazon identified a vulnerability in the Amazon WorkSpaces client for
Linux. Under specialized circumstances, an attacker may be able to
extract a valid authentication token from the client's machine and
access another user's Workspace. The impacted client versions have
reached end-of-support. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to a
supported version. 

 NEARLY 30 ALLEGED VICTIMS OF ORACLE EBS HACK NAMED ON CL0P RANSOMWARE
SITE (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Nearly 30 organizations, including major firms such as Logitech, The
Washington Post, and Cox Enterprises, were allegedly impacted by a
Cl0p ransomware campaign that exploited Oracle's E-Business Suite.
Some, such as Harvard and The Washington Post, have confirmed
involvement, but most have not commented on the matter.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CISOS MUST PROVE THE BUSINESS VALUE OF CYBER — THE RIGHT METRICS
CAN HELP (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 CISOs struggle to demonstrate the value of security because they
often rely on technical metrics, such as MITRE ATT&CK and patch
statistics, rather than business-focused measures. Boards are fatigued
from unclear capital allocation and lack visibility into how
cybersecurity investments lower risk. Experts advise establishing
enterprise risk management, calculating financial exposure in dollars,
and presenting understandable metrics like industry benchmarks, risk
reduction, and ROI. CISOs should align security with business goals by
consulting departments, translating cyber risks into financial terms,
and showing measurable risk reduction, such as a 40% decrease in cyber
loss exposure. 

 ATT&CK V18: THE DETECTION OVERHAUL YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR (7 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 MITRE ATT&CK v18 introduces two new components, Detection Strategies
and Analytics, replacing brief detection notes with detailed,
behavior-based guidance that connects techniques to platform-specific
analytics, log sources, and data elements. The enterprise domain
introduces 13 new techniques, covering Kubernetes, CI/CD pipeline
tampering, cloud databases, and ransomware preparation activities,
including backup software detection and selective file exclusion, as
well as adversary monitoring of their own threat intelligence. The
framework suggests splitting the Defense Evasion tactic into Stealth
(altering defender visibility) and Impair Defenses (disrupting
security controls), while launching an ATT&CK Advisory Council for
formal community input and establishing faster CTI releases
independent of biannual framework updates. 

 IMPLEMENTING THE ETHERHIDING TECHNIQUE (7 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Etherhiding is a technique used by attackers to distribute malware
using public blockchains, specifically Ethereum. It works by hiding
critical information, such as payloads or configuration data, within
blockchain smart contracts, making them accessible while making them
difficult to take down or block. This hands-on demo shows how to build
a simple Ethereum smart contract using Solidity, deploy it to the
Sepolia test network via MetaMask, and create a web page that
retrieves and displays the hidden information from the blockchain
using Infura RPC.

 NAKIVO INTRODUCES V11.1 WITH UPGRADED DISASTER RECOVERY AND MSP
FEATURES (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 NAKIVO Backup & Replication v11.1 offers enhanced features, including
real-time VMware replication with automated failover via Site Recovery
workflows, eliminating manual setup through automatic IO Filter and
Journal Service installation. It broadens Proxmox VE support with
Flash VM Boot for instant recovery, VM replication, and direct tape
recovery, while MSP Direct Connect enables secure, encrypted
client-side connectivity supporting VMware, Hyper-V, and Proxmox VE.
Additionally, the update introduces granular backup options for
physical Windows and Linux systems, allowing selective folder and
volume protection with flexible recovery methods such as SMB/NFS
shares, all featuring encryption, immutability, and air-gapping for
ransomware defense. 

 MAD-CAT (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 MAD-CAT (Meow Attack Data Corruption Automation Tool) is a security
testing program designed to simulate data corruption attacks on six
database platforms: MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Redis, CouchDB,
and Hadoop HDFS. It allows for both single-target tests and bulk CSV
attack campaigns, with options for scenarios that include credentials
or not. This enables security teams to evaluate how well their
databases can withstand corruption threats. Security experts can
utilize MAD-CAT to examine data integrity measures and verify backup
and recovery processes across various database setups within their
systems. 

 ONLYSHELL (GITHUB REPO) [17] 

 OnlyShell is a powerful Go-based reverse shell handler that allows
you to manage multiple reverse shell connections simultaneously.

 RUSSIAN NATIONAL PLEADS GUILTY TO BREAKING INTO NETWORKS FOR
YANLUOWANG RANSOMWARE ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Aleksei Olegovich Volkov (aka "chubaka.kor") pleaded guilty to
serving as an initial access broker for Yanluowang ransomware,
attacking seven US businesses between July 2021 and November 2022,
with total ransom demands reaching $24 million. FBI blockchain
analysis traced cryptocurrency payments to accounts owned by Volkov
and a co-conspirator in Indianapolis, confirming his identity and
communications about attack coordination and profit-sharing. Volkov
faces up to 53 years in prison and must pay $9.2 million in
restitution. Victims experienced operational shutdowns, data
encryption, executive harassment calls, and DDoS attacks following
initial compromise through vulnerability exploitation. 

 WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING HACKED WITH GOVERNMENT SPYWARE (4
MINUTE READ) [19] 

 The reach of government spyware now extends far beyond its original
promise of targeting only criminals and terrorists. Increasingly,
journalists, activists, and minor political figures around the world
are being surveilled, enabled by vendors whose scalable technology and
weak oversight make widespread abuse easy. Governments, both
democratic and authoritarian, face little accountability or
limitation, although international moves and investigations may
finally be prompting some overdue scrutiny and action. 

 NEW BROWSER SECURITY REPORT REVEALS EMERGING THREATS FOR ENTERPRISES
(5 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Emerging enterprise threats increasingly concentrate in the user's
browser. Unmanaged AI tools, browser extensions, and non-corporate
logins are key risks, as traditional security solutions can't see or
manage what happens in browser sessions, enabling sensitive data
exposure. Set up session-native controls and browser-level monitoring
to close these critical security gaps and prevent breaches.

 CBP ROLLS OUT FACIAL RECOGNITION APP FOR LOCAL POLICE TO SPOT ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS (1 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 US Customs and Border Protection deployed Mobile Identify (listed as
"287 TFM" on Google Play Store), a facial recognition app enabling 555
local law enforcement agencies across 34 states participating in
Section 287(g) programs to identify immigration status by scanning
faces, returning reference numbers requiring ICE contact rather than
direct personal information, with captured photos stored for 15 years
even for US citizens. 

 FBI WANTS TO KNOW WHO RUNS ARCHIVE.PH (2 MINUTE READ) [22] 

 The FBI issued a federal subpoena to domain registrar Tucows
demanding extensive billing records, internet session logs, payment
information, and cloud computing service details to unmask the
anonymous operator behind archive.today (Archive.is and Archive.ph), a
web archiving service operational since 2012 that's commonly used to
bypass news paywalls, though the subpoena does not specify what crime
is being investigated. 

 YOU'LL NEVER GUESS THE LOUVRE'S ONETIME CCTV PASSWORD. (YOU
ABSOLUTELY WILL) (4 MINUTE READ) [23] 

 The French court criticized the Louvre for prioritizing art spending
over security, exposing long-known weaknesses, including easy-to-guess
passwords (such as "LOUVRE") and a lack of CCTV, which enabled a major
jewelry heist.
