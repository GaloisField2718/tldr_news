ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AWS CLOUDFORMATION PHISHING ATTACK: A GROWING THREAT (3 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 The AWS CloudFormation phishing attack begins with fake AWS Support
emails containing a "Launch Stack" button that redirects victims to
the AWS CloudFormation console. Clicking it deploys a template that
creates an IAM role with admin privileges and a trust policy for the
attacker's account. The IAM Role ARN is sent to the attacker's API
Gateway, resulting in complete account compromise through privilege
escalation, resource creation, and data exfiltration, avoiding
detection. 

 CHINESE HACKERS BREACH JUNIPER NETWORKS ROUTERS WITH CUSTOM BACKDOORS
AND ROOTKITS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Chinese cyber espionage group UNC3886 has targeted Juniper Networks
MX routers nearing end-of-life, using six TinyShell-based backdoors
for file transfers, shell command execution, and log disabling. They
exploit JunOS security by using legitimate credentials for privileged
access and injecting malicious payloads into the memory of legitimate
processes. Juniper Networks has addressed this vulnerability
(CVE-2025-21590) in recent OS updates and advises organizations to
upgrade their devices to the latest Juniper Malware Removal Tool
versions. 

 NEW OBSCURE#BAT MALWARE TARGETS USERS WITH FAKE CAPTCHAS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 OBSCURE#BAT malware tricks users with fake captchas and software
downloads to evade detection and steal data. It hides in systems using
rootkit technology, making it hard to detect. To stay safe, only
download from trusted sources and use threat detection tools.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI: ADVENT OF AGENTS OPENS NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR ATTACKERS (4 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Symantec demonstrates how OpenAI's Operator agent could execute a
basic cyberattack with minimal prompt engineering. The research
highlights that while most LLM attacker use cases have been passive,
AI-powered agents with web interaction capabilities present expanded
opportunities for both legitimate users and potential attackers. 

 DEEPSEEK CAN BE GENTLY PERSUADED TO SPIT OUT MALWARE CODE (3 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 DeepSeek's R1 model can create malicious code with careful prompting
despite its guardrails. Tenable researchers generated working
keyloggers and basic ransomware after claiming educational purposes,
though manual intervention was needed to fix bugs. 

 THE ROAD TO ZERO TRUST IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS (13 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Zero trust architecture requires continuous verification of users and
devices regardless of network location. A four-level maturity model
helps organizations assess progress, though complete implementation
faces challenges with SaaS, device verification, and legacy systems.
Organizations should approach zero trust as an ongoing journey
tailored to their risk profile rather than a checklist.

organizations until February 2025, leading the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC
to issue a joint advisory for network defenders. The ransomware
developers recruited access brokers via cybercriminal forums and used
techniques to evade detection, executing double extortion schemes that
demanded payment for decrypting files and preventing data leaks.
