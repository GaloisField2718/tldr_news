 TEST YOUR TEAM'S READINESS AGAINST DEEPFAKE PHISHING FOR FREE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's social engineering spans far beyond the email inbox. Bad
actors use AI to phish, and are using SMS texts, voicemails, and even
video chats to scam.

That's why Adaptive Security — the security awareness platform built
for next-generation threats — is offering a free readiness check,
giving you an interactive preview of how AI-powered phishing works
across channels.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EVEREST RANSOMWARE CLAIMS ASUS BREACH AND 1TB DATA THEFT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 The Everest ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching
ASUS and exfiltrating over 1TB of data allegedly containing
proprietary camera source code, firmware, and drivers for devices with
built-in cameras. The group issued a 21-hour deadline for ASUS to
respond via Qtox encrypted messaging, following recent claimed attacks
on Under Armour, Petrobras, and Iberia airline. ASUS has neither
confirmed nor denied the breach, which, if verified, would mark the
second significant infrastructure compromise since the 2019
ShadowHammer supply chain attack. 

 GMARKET SUFFERS UNAUTHORIZED PAYMENT INCIDENT AFFECTING 60 USERS AMID
HACKING WOES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Financial authorities have begun an emergency on-site inspection of
the Korean e-commerce platform Gmarket after reports of unauthorized
mobile payments. The attackers purchased mobile gift certificates
using credit cards registered with Gmarket's simple payment service.
Gmarket claims that the unauthorized payments resulted from account
compromise, not a data breach. 

 K7 ANTIVIRUS VULNERABILITY ALLOWS ATTACKERS TO GAIN SYSTEM-LEVEL
PRIVILEGES (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher discovered a privilege escalation vulnerability
in the K7 Ultimate Security antivirus while investigating an unrelated
DoS vulnerability. The vulnerability exploited named pipes with overly
permissive access control lists, allowing a non-admin user to execute
arbitrary code as SYSTEM during fake updates. K7 worked with the
researcher to issue three patches to provide interim fixes for the
vulnerability pending full ACL enforcement in a future release.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FROM ZERO TO SYSTEM: BUILDING PRINTSPOOFER FROM SCRATCH (11 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 A Windows privilege escalation technique exploits named pipes and the
Print Spooler's RPC interface to elevate accounts with
SeImpersonatePrivilege, such as IIS app pool identities, to SYSTEM. It
exploits its lack of SQOS protection and a path-validation bug that
can be bypassed by crafting backslash/forward-slash-separated pipe
paths to trigger SYSTEM connections to an attacker‑controlled pipe. 

 68% OF PHISHING WEBSITES ARE PROTECTED BY CLOUDFLARE (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Modern phishing operations increasingly rely on mainstream
infrastructure like Cloudflare, major cloud providers, and popular
developer-focused TLDs such as .dev and .app to appear legitimate and
resist takedown. Attackers mix disposable direct-hosted servers with
CDN-protected setups, often hiding behind services like Vercel, GitHub
Pages, and other trusted platforms that organizations cannot simply
block. Phishing-as-a-Service ecosystems now provide turnkey kits with
MFA bypass, session cookie theft, and advanced evasion, heavily
targeting brands like Meta, Amazon, and PayPal.

 CYBER STARTUP FRENETIK LAUNCHES WITH PATENTED DECEPTION TECHNOLOGY
THAT BETS AGAINST THE AI ARMS RACE (2 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Maryland-based Frenetik emerged from stealth with patented "Deception
In-Use" technology (US Patent 12,463,981) that continuously rotates
active identities and resources across Microsoft Entra, AWS, Google
Cloud, and on-premises environments to invalidate attacker
reconnaissance. The approach exploits information asymmetry by
ensuring defenders receive real-time change notifications through
out-of-band channels while attackers operate on stale intelligence,
funneling them into honeypots and decoys. A free community version is
available for organizations seeking to implement active deception
without extensive tuning or analyst oversight.

 RESEARCHERS CAPTURE LAZARUS APT'S REMOTE-WORKER SCHEME LIVE ON CAMERA
(4 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers from BCA LTD, NorthScan, and ANY.RUN captured Lazarus
Group's Famous Chollima division operating live by deploying sandbox
VMs disguised as developer workstations to trap operators targeting
Western companies in finance, crypto, healthcare, and engineering
sectors. The investigation revealed a toolkit focused on identity
takeover rather than malware. Organizations should implement enhanced
vetting for remote hires as attackers request full identity documents
and 24/7 laptop access to infiltrate companies without deploying
traditional malicious payloads. 

 SECURITY RESEARCHER FUMES AT LOW MACOS BUG BOUNTY REWARDS (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The new Apple Security Bounty payouts devalue macOS. Full
Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) bypasses are down from $30.5k
to just $5k, while other TCC categories have been reduced from $5-$10k
to just $1k. This shows an admission by Apple that it can't fix
everything and is prioritizing iPhone users over Mac users. 

 FRAUDULENT GAMBLING NETWORK MAY ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING MORE NEFARIOUS
(6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A long‑running online gambling operation targeting Indonesian users
is built on hundreds of thousands of owned and hijacked domains,
compromised WordPress/PHP sites, and malicious Android apps. Its cost,
scale, and advanced tradecraft point to an APT-style, possibly
state-aligned group that uses the gambling infrastructure as both a
revenue stream and cover for stealthy access to Western government and
industry networks.

 INDIA ORDERS MESSAGING APPS TO WORK ONLY WITH ACTIVE SIM CARDS TO
PREVENT FRAUD AND MISUSE (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 India's Department of Telecommunications directed messaging apps,
including WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal, to require account linking
to an active SIM card and implement mandatory 6-hour web session
logouts within 90 days to combat cross-border fraud, phishing, and
"digital arrest" scams that exploit anonymous or migrated accounts. 

 GOOGLE PATCHES 107 ANDROID FLAWS, INCLUDING TWO BEING ACTIVELY

framework flaws (CVE-2025-48633 and CVE-2025-48572) that enable local
code execution via improper input validation on Android 13-16. 

 HERE'S YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE: E-TAILER CAN ONLY RESUME PARTIAL SALES

 Japanese e-tailer Askul restored B2B online sales and warehouse
systems after a ransomware attack in October disrupted ordering,
shipping, and logistics for its brands and partners, forcing temporary
reliance on fax-based ordering for critical customers.
