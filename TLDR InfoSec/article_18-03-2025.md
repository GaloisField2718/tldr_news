ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 100 CAR DEALERSHIPS HIT BY SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 100 dealerships have been compromised through ClickFix code
displaying fake reCAPTCHA prompts. When clicked, these prompts copied
commands to users' clipboards and instructed them to execute these in
Windows Run, ultimately installing SectopRAT malware. 

 APACHE TOMCAT VULNERABILITY ACTIVELY EXPLOITED JUST 30 HOURS AFTER
PUBLIC DISCLOSURE (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CVE-2025-24813 in Apache Tomcat is under active exploitation 30 hours
post-disclosure. The vulnerability enables remote code execution
through malicious serialized Java uploads via PUT requests, no
authentication is required. It is critical to update to versions
9.0.99, 10.1.35, and 11.0.3 ASAP. 

 MALICIOUS ADOBE, DOCUSIGN OAUTH APPS TARGET MICROSOFT 365 ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Proofpoint researchers uncovered a malware campaign using malicious
OAuth apps posing as Adobe Drive, Adobe Drive X, Adobe Acrobat, and
DocuSign. These apps request minimal benign permissions but redirect
users to phishing pages or malware downloads.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DETECTING HOTKEY-BASED KEYLOGGERS USING AN UNDOCUMENTED KERNEL DATA
STRUCTURE (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Hotkey-based keyloggers register alphanumeric hotkeys that, on
keypress, record the keystroke, unregister the hotkey, resend the
keypress, and reregister the hotkey. These keyloggers are stealthy
since the RegisterHotKey and UnregisterHotKey APIs are not monitored
by ETW. In this post, Elastic researchers detail their detection
method for hotkey-based keyloggers using an undocumented kernel data
structure listing all registered keyloggers' hotkeys. 

 THE CAT FLAP - HOW TO REALLY PURRSIST IN AWS ACCOUNTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[11] 

 This post describes a method for obtaining backdoor persistence in
AWS by modifying the AWSControlTowerExecution role to allow an
attacker-controlled account to assume it. The attack is effective
because many tools will not flag violations against this role, which
contains AdministratorAccess by default. There are likely other AWS
service roles that this attack could utilize. 

 ANALYSIS AT SCALE WITH X64DBG AUTOMATE (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The post covers how to use x64dbg Automate to automate repetitive
x64dbg tasks like finding malware entrypoints, annotating payloads,
and bypassing anti-debug checks. A malware sample is included for
experimentation.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 📊 GET A HANDLE ON YOUR CVE FOOTPRINT WITH CHAINGUARD CVE
VISUALIZATIONS (SPONSOR) [13] 

 CVE management can be a thankless slog: engineering teams plug away
without an effective strategy or end in sight, while business leaders
lack data to make real changes. Chainguard's new CVE Visualizations
functionality [13] allows organizations to better understand and
communicate the benefits of zero CVE images versus the costs of
ongoing CVE management. Read the blog [13] 

 AICEBERG (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Aiceberg is designed to prevent unsanctioned, unsuitable, or illegal
content and automatically redacts personal and other sensitive
information. It can detect common cyberattack vectors such as prompt
injection, prompt leaking, and jailbreaking and is capable of
performing a security analysis of agentic workflows. 

 NODE VERSION AUDIT (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 Node Version Audit is a convenient tool to easily check a given
Node.js version against a regularly updated list of CVE exploits, new
releases, and end-of-life dates. 

 ANNOUNCING OSV-SCANNER V2: VULNERABILITY SCANNER AND REMEDIATION TOOL
FOR OPEN SOURCE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google's OSV-Scanner V2.0.0 is an open-source vulnerability scanner
that now integrates with OSV-SCALIBR. It offers improved dependency
extraction, layer-aware container scanning for Debian, Ubuntu, and
Alpine images, interactive HTML output, and guided remediation for
Maven pom.xml files. Future plans for the project include enhanced
integration with OSV-SCALIBR, increased ecosystem support, full
filesystem accountability, reachability analysis, and VEX support.

concerns. Experts recommend using advanced filtering and privacy
proxies to mitigate these risks. 

 UPDATE: STOPPING CYBERCRIMINALS FROM ABUSING COBALT STRIKE (3 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 Microsoft, Fortra, and Health ISAC are working together to stop
cybercriminals from misusing Cobalt Strike and compromised Microsoft
software to deploy ransomware. They have made significant progress in
reducing the availability of unauthorized copies and seizing malicious
domains. Ongoing efforts include sending takedown notices and
collaborating with law enforcement to combat illicit usage of cyber
intrusion tools.
