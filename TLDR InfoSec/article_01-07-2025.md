 EXPOSING THE INNER WORKINGS OF NORTH KOREA'S CYBER THREAT OPERATION
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 A new report by DTEX Systems [4] reveals the surprising motivations
and intricate operations behind DPRK's covert cyber workforce—which
operates more like an international crime network than a
state-sponsored group. It covers:

 	* An org chart detailing DPRK's cyber structure.
 	* Details of active DPRK cyber operatives, methods, and infiltration
tactics.
 	* Inside Research Center 227—DPRK's AI unit actively enabling
hacking operations.
 	* Why DRPK operatives are motivated by survival rather than
ideology, and the implications.
 	* Behavioral and technical markers [4] to detect embedded DPRK cyber
operatives early.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 1,200 CITRIX SERVERS UNPATCHED AGAINST CRITICAL AUTH BYPASS FLAW
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Over 1,200 Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances remain
unpatched against CVE-2025-5777 ("Citrix Bleed 2"), a critical
authentication bypass vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack
user sessions and bypass multi-factor authentication. ReliaQuest
reports with medium confidence that the flaw is already being actively
exploited, with indicators including hijacked web sessions, suspicious
IP address usage, and Active Directory reconnaissance activities.
Organizations must immediately patch their NetScaler appliances and
terminate all active ICA and PCoIP sessions to prevent session
hijacking attacks similar to those seen in previous CitrixBleed
ransomware campaigns. 

 STABLECOIN PROTOCOL RESUPPLY LOSES $9.6M TO PRICE MANIPULATION
EXPLOIT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Resupply confirmed a security
breach in its wstUSR market which resulted in $9.6M in losses. The
attacker used a price manipulation exploit to inflate the share price
which allowed them to borrow $10M reUSD with minimal collateral.
Resupply paused the contracts to prevent further damage upon
detection. 

 ZURICH NON-PROFIT HIT BY RANSOMWARE, SWISS FEDERAL DATA AT RISK (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Radix, a Zurich-based non-profit health foundation, was hit by a
ransomware attack on June 16. The Sarcoma group released 1.3TB of
stolen data after ransom demands failed. The breach affected data from
Swiss federal offices that trusted Radix, though attackers didn't
access Federal Administration systems directly. Swiss authorities are
investigating the attack and warned of potential future phishing
campaigns using the stolen data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HACKER CONVERSATIONS: RACHEL TOBAC AND THE ART OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING
(8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security, demonstrates how social
engineers exploit psychological principles, such as the principles of
urgency, authority, and scarcity, to trick targets into revealing
sensitive information or credentials. Her methods involve OSINT
research, AI-generated voice clones, background audio effects, and
caller ID spoofing to craft convincing stories that bypass human
verification. Organizations should enhance identity checks beyond
simple data, such as birthdates and addresses, as attackers can easily
obtain this information from data brokers to impersonate real
customers. 

 USING AI TO IDENTIFY CYBERCRIME MASTERMINDS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sophos researchers created an AI framework that analyzes 11,558 posts
from 4,441 individuals across 124 dark web forums, mapping discussions
to CVE exploits and MITRE CAPEC patterns. It clusters threat actors by
skill, commitment, and activity, identifying 14 "professional" actors
(3.9%) with high expertise and a focused approach. This automated
method helps threat teams prioritize investigations and reduce manual
analysis when spotting key criminals. 

 COMPARING SEMGREP PRO AND COMMUNITY WHITEPAPER (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is crucial for modern
application security. Semgrep has become popular due to its accessible
Community Edition. This research compares Semgrep's free and
commercial versions, showing that Semgrep Code identifies more
findings and achieves better true positive rates than the Community
Edition.

MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Kraken ransomware group claims to have breached Humac, the Nordic
region's largest Apple Premium Partner, stealing financial
information, customer data, and employee details. Cybernews verified
that the leaked data appears legitimate. The data includes employee
records, internal files, and database samples from the retailer, which

law enforcement. The hackers could break into phones, hack into Mexico
City's security cameras, and track where people went. The cartel used
this information to threaten and kill witnesses.
