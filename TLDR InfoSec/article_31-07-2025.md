ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW LENOVO UEFI FIRMWARE UPDATES FIX SECURE BOOT BYPASS FLAWS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Lenovo is warning users about new high-severity BIOS flaws that could
allow attackers to bypass Secure Boot on some IdeaCentre AIO and Yoga
AIO models. The vulnerabilities may enable local attackers to execute
arbitrary code in System Management Mode (SMM), a CPU mode that
operates independently from the OS and hypervisor, allowing them to
plant “undetectable” malware that bypasses OS-level defenses. 

 HACKERS ACTIVELY EXPLOIT CRITICAL RCE IN WORDPRESS ALONE THEME (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 WordPress security firm Wordfence has reported an actively exploited,
critical unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the
premium WordPress theme ‘Alone.' The vulnerability stems from the
theme's `alone_import_pack_install_plugin()` function, which lacks
nonce checks, is exposed via a `wp_ajax_nopriv_hook`, and permits
plugin installation via AJAX. Attackers exploit the flaw by sending a
POST request with a remote source URL pointing to an
attacker-controlled file with webshells or other payloads. 

 RANSOMWARE GANG SETS DEADLINE TO LEAK 3.5 TB OF INGRAM MICRO DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The SafePay ransomware group is threatening to leak 3.5TB of Ingram
Micro data on August 1, nearly a month after the attack. Although
Ingram Micro claimed containment and restored operations by July 9,
the company's appearance on SafePay's leak site suggests that no
ransom was paid.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 COST OF A DATA BREACH REPORT 2025 (20 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 IBM's 2025 breach report shows that global breach costs fell to $4.44
million while US breach costs reached a record high of $10.22 million.
AI is emerging as both an attack vector and a defense mechanism, with
13% of breaches involving AI models due to inadequate access controls.
Phishing has overtaken stolen credentials as the most common initial
attack vector. 

 DREAMWALKERS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Reflectively loading modules is a technique to hide malware payloads
injected via shellcode. Traditionally, the call stack cannot be
convincingly spoofed due to missing unwind information. This post
introduces a technique called DreamWalkers, which parses the PE
structure to register unwind information via `RtlAddFunctionTable`,
creating clean and convincing call stacks.
