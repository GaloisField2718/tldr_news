ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers leaked 86 million AT&T customer records, including full
names, addresses, and decrypted Social Security Numbers. The data may
be linked to a 2024 breach involving the Snowflake cloud platform, but
this is not confirmed. AT&T has not yet said whether this new leak is
part of a past or new breach. 

 RANSOMWARE GANG CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR KETTERING HEALTH HACK (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ransomware group Interlock claimed responsibility for hacking
Kettering Health's Ohio hospital network, stealing 940GB of data,

ransom negotiations failed. 

 FBI: PLAY RANSOMWARE BREACHED 900 VICTIMS, INCLUDING CRITICAL ORGS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In a joint effort with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre,
the FBI has stated that the Play ransomware gang has breached roughly
900 organizations as of May. The Play Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)
operation threatens organizations, saying that it will release stolen
information on its leak site to pressure victims into paying. Play is
also notable in that it negotiates with victims over email as opposed
to a Tor negotiations page and each infection uses recompiled malware
to complicate detection.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURITY ISN'T A SOLO SPORT: COMMUNITY, BURNOUT, AND IDENTITY AT
BSIDES312 (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Over 260 professionals gathered at BSides312, a cybersecurity
conference at Chicago's Irish American Heritage Center, to discuss
community, burnout, and human-centered security challenges. Key
speakers highlighted identity misconfigurations and privilege
escalation in cloud environments as major attack vectors, advocating
for active defense strategies beyond traditional firewalls and
antivirus solutions. The conference emphasized that effective security
relies on strong human connections, psychological safety, and
communication hygiene within teams, as technical vulnerabilities often
arise from human and organizational failures rather than technical
issues.
