 NEW RESEARCH: COMPANY-WIDE MANDATES DRIVE 2.4X PASSWORD MANAGER USAGE
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Bitwarden surveyed IT managers and enterprise users to find out what
actually drives password manager adoption. The biggest factor?
Leadership directives.

Organizations with company-wide mandates experience 79% regular
password manager usage, compared to just 36% without one. But mandates
alone don't solve the problem. The latest Security Impact Report [5]
breaks down what really works:

🤖 Technical enforcement (like disabling browser password storage)
rated VERY EFFECTIVE by 43%

📣 Executive announcements explaining security importance were rated
the most effective communication tactic by 38%

🔐 Phased department-by-department rollouts build momentum and
streamline onboarding

🏆 99% reported improved security posture after deploying Bitwarden
across their organization.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TREND MICRO FIXED A REMOTE CODE EXECUTION IN APEX CENTRAL (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Trend Micro patched three vulnerabilities in Apex Central on-premise,
including a critical RCE flaw in LoadLibraryEX (CVE-2025-69258, CVSS
9.8) that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute code as SYSTEM
by loading malicious DLLs. Tenable disclosed the vulnerabilities along
with PoC exploit code after discovering them in August. Organizations
running Apex Central below Build 7190 should apply the critical patch
immediately and restrict remote access to management consoles. 

 CISA ORDERS FEDS TO PATCH GOGS RCE FLAW EXPLOITED IN 0-DAY ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 CISA has ordered government agencies to secure their systems against
a high-severity vulnerability in the Gogs alternative for GitHub. The
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability is caused by a path
traversal weakness in the PutContents API that allows attackers to
bypass protections implemented for a previous RCE bug. Attackers can
exploit the vulnerability by creating symbolic links that point to
system files and then using the PutContents API to write data to those
files via the symbolic links. 

 ‘BAD ACTOR' HIJACKS APEX LEGENDS CHARACTERS IN LIVE MATCHES (2
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apex Legends players experienced disruptions during live matches over
the weekend as threat actors hijacked their characters, removed them
from matches, and changed their nicknames. Players theorized that a
threat actor obtained access to an administrative panel for the game.
Apex Legends publisher Respawn stated that it had remediated the
security incident and that the attackers were unable to access
sensitive files or execute code on victims' devices.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PWNING CLAUDE CODE IN 8 DIFFERENT WAYS (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Claude Code was found to execute arbitrary system commands without
explicit user approval through eight distinct techniques that bypassed
its command-safety mechanisms. These issues stemmed from fragile
regex-based blocklists on “safe” commands like man, sort, sed,
git, xargs, and rg, plus subtle Bash variable expansion tricks that
hid real payloads. An attacker could turn supposedly read‑only
operations into command execution paths by abusing lesser-known flags
and prompt-like variable expansion. The problems were ultimately fixed
by moving from a blocklist-first design to a stricter allowlist model
in Claude Code v1.0.93. 

 THE MAP IS NOT THE TERRITORY: THE AGENT-TOOL TRUST BOUNDARY (15
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Modern AI agents often treat model outputs as fully trusted inputs to
tools, creating a dangerous gap between text strings (the map) and
what the underlying system actually does (the territory). Attackers
exploit this by encoding malicious behavior in paths, URLs, or shell
commands that pass superficial checks but resolve to sensitive files,
internal services, or injected commands at execution time. Robust
defenses require layered, deterministic guards: semantic validation
that interprets arguments as the system will, and execution-time
checks that verify real filesystem and network behavior rather than
relying on regexes or human confirmation alone. 

 AWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION: IAM RISKS, SERVICE-BASED ATTACKS, AND NEW
AI-DRIVEN BEDROCK/AGENTCORE VECTORS (22 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 AWS privilege escalation has evolved from classic IAM
misconfigurations to service-based execution paths and now AI-driven
orchestration via Bedrock Agents and AgentCore Code Interpreters. New
attack vectors include creating code interpreters that execute Python
under privileged agent roles and hijacking Lambda functions backing
Bedrock agent tools, both of which enable multi-stage privilege chains
to sensitive resources. Testing across 16 scenarios showed that all
were exploitable in unrestricted environments but preventable with
properly configured SCP-based guardrails, highlighting that native AWS
controls often cannot granularly constrain high-risk actions that lack
ARNs or condition keys.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 VULNERABLE-MCP-SERVERS-LAB (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 This repository contains a collection of intentionally vulnerable
Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations for security
training, covering common failure modes including path traversal,
indirect prompt injection, eval-based RCE, namespace typosquatting,
and secrets exposure. Each server includes documentation on
exploitation techniques, supporting hands-on training for pentesters
learning AI agent security and MCP integration risks. Intended for
isolated lab environments only. 

 RENGINE (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework for web applications
focused on highly configurable, streamlined recon processes via
Engines, recon data correlation, and organization. It supports
continuous monitoring and is backed by a database. 

 UNKOVER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 unKover is a Windows anti-rootkit driver that can detect drivers
mapped to kernel memory.

 FINTECH FIRM BETTERMENT CONFIRMS DATA BREACH AFTER HACKERS SEND FAKE
CRYPTO SCAM NOTIFICATION TO USERS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Betterment disclosed that attackers used social engineering to access
some customer data, including names and contact details, via
third-party marketing and operations platforms, and then pushed a fake
in‑app crypto message promising to triple deposits sent to a
malicious wallet. The firm says no accounts or credentials were
compromised. It is investigating the incident with external
cybersecurity support. 

 RUSSIA'S FANCY BEAR APT DOUBLES DOWN ON GLOBAL SECRETS THEFT (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Russian Fancy Bear APT has been carrying out a low-complexity,
spear-phishing campaign targeting governments or organizations of
strategic value to Russia. The phishing emails contain a link to a
document that the target believes is relevant, which then redirects
them to a phishing page for an email or VPN provider. While Fancy Bear
is better known for more sophisticated malware campaigns, this
campaign may have been chosen as a low-cost effort to gain access to
notable organizations. 

 THINGS YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SERVICE-LINKED ROLES
(12 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 AWS Service-Linked Roles (SLRs) are a special class of IAM roles
managed by AWS and used to bootstrap services or resources within
services that depend on other services. SLRs are largely undocumented,
so the author of this post used the undocumented iamv2 API to
enumerate the trust policies and IAM policies of the SLRs used by as
many services as they could find. They discovered several “code
smells” in the IAM policies, such as a lack of confused-deputy
protection, resource policies that use wildcards, tag-based policies,
or name-based policies.

from the machine-readable zone, rendering documents non-compliant with
ICAO standards and potentially unusable at automated border gates.
