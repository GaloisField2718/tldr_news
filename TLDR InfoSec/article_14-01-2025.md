ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 A BREACH OF GRAVY ANALYTICS' HUGE TROVE OF LOCATION DATA THREATENS
THE PRIVACY OF MILLIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A major data breach at Gravy Analytics threatens millions of people's
smartphone location data, collected through app advertising networks.
The hacker leaked 30 million location points from various apps,
including sensitive locations. The breach occurred via a compromised
Amazon cloud key, prompting investigations by data protection
authorities. 

 NOMINET PROBES NETWORK INTRUSION LINKED TO IVANTI ZERO-DAY EXPLOIT (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Nominet discovered a network intrusion through Ivanti VPN software's
latest zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-0282). While domain systems
remain operational and no data theft is confirmed, this marks the
first public case of this exploit. 

 MICROSOFT: MACOS BUG LETS HACKERS INSTALL MALICIOUS KERNEL DRIVERS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple patched a macOS vulnerability that allowed hackers to bypass
System Integrity Protection and install malicious kernel drivers by
exploiting a flaw in the Storage Kit daemon. This flaw, designated as
CVE-2024-44243, could be abused by local attackers with root
privileges to compromise Mac systems without physical access,
potentially leading to the installation of persistent malware and data
theft. Microsoft emphasized the importance of SIP in protecting macOS
systems and highlighted the need for robust security solutions to
detect and prevent such threats.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FUNKSEC – ALLEGED TOP RANSOMWARE GROUP POWERED BY AI (15 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 FunkSec ransomware group emerged in late 2024, claiming 85+ victims
in December. Analysis suggests they use AI-assisted malware
development despite apparent inexperience and that many of their
leaked datasets appear to be recycled from previous hacktivist
campaigns. 

 THE SHIFTING LANDSCAPE OF OPEN SOURCE SECURITY (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post dives into the landscape of OSS, which in 2025 faces
increased supply chain attacks and regulatory demands. Key trends
include AI's dual role in cybersecurity (both helping and hindering),
the impact of the EU's Cyber Resilience Act, and the growing emphasis
on continuous monitoring. 

 AVOIDING MISTAKES WITH AWS OIDC INTEGRATION CONDITIONS (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This article discusses a critical security issue with AWS OpenID
Connect (OIDC) integrations where missing or incorrectly configured
conditions in IAM role trust policies could allow unauthorized access
to AWS accounts. The article explains that while the "sub" condition
is commonly known to be required (especially for GitHub Actions),
different vendors may require different or additional conditions, such
as Microsoft Defender requiring "sts:RoleSessionName" or some vendors
using custom conditions. The key recommendation is that AWS customers
should ensure all their OIDC integrations have both "aud" and "sub"
conditions (unless vendor documentation specifically indicates
otherwise) and investigate any exceptions carefully, as there are many
vendors that work differently and some even recommend additional
security measures like IP address restrictions.

 SECURITY AT SCALE: PLAID'S JOURNEY TO CREATING A KEY MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM (5 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Plaid launched an effort to build its own Key Management System (KMS)
to curb bespoke cryptographic processes across different teams and
services. It chose to build its own system over using a
vendor-provided solution to avoid API limitations that would hamper
scalability, lower costs, and be self-service. The migration process
proved to be the most challenging part of building the system. 

 THE MANY WAYS TO OBTAIN CREDENTIALS IN AWS (5 MINUTE READ) [14]

by listing out more specialized ways that certain services can obtain
credentials. 

 SNYK SECURITY RESEARCHER DEPLOYS MALICIOUS NPM PACKAGES TARGETING
CURSOR.COM (3 MINUTE READ) [15]
