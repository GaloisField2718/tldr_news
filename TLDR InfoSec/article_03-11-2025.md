ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW HERODOTUS ANDROID MALWARE FAKES HUMAN TYPING TO AVOID DETECTION
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat Fabric has detected a new Android malware-as-a-service (MaaS)
dubbed Herodotus that is being used in campaigns targeting Italian and
Brazilian users through smishing. The malware uses a novel randomized
delay of 0.3 to 3 seconds when typing to mimic human typing and evade
behavioral detections. Herodotus also provides clients with a control
panel to customize the SMS message, as well as the ability to overlay
pages mimicking banking and crypto pages to steal credentials, overlay
opaque pages to hide malicious behavior, an SMS stealer for MFA
interception, and screen recording. 

 “WE GOT HACKED” EMAILS THREATEN TO LEAK UNIVERSITY OF
PENNSYLVANIA DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This past Friday, students and alumni of the University of
Pennsylvania received a series of offensive emails from various
university email addresses stating that their data had been leaked.
The university reported that its incident response team is addressing
the issue, but hasn't released more specifics. The article includes a
copy of the email, which appears to be politically motivated. 

 EY EXPOSES 4TB+ SQL DATABASE TO OPEN INTERNET FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
(4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 EY accidentally left a massive, unencrypted 4TB SQL Server backup
file publicly accessible online, exposing sensitive data that included
API keys, passwords, and credentials. The database became accessible
due to a misconfigured cloud bucket. The breach's duration is unknown.
EY responded swiftly after being alerted and resolved the issue within
a week, likely preventing further damage.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 METHODOLOGY: HOW WE DISCOVERED OVER 2K HIGH-IMPACT VULNERABILITIES IN
APPS BUILT WITH VIBE CODING PLATFORMS (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Platforms that enable anyone to build applications without prior
coding experience are surging in popularity, but they also introduce
serious security concerns. Escape's research analyzed over 5,600
publicly available applications created with these “vibe coding”
tools and found more than 2,000 vulnerabilities, along with hundreds
of exposed secrets and personal data. Many issues arose from
inexperienced users misconfiguring security, particularly when
platforms automatically integrated third-party services, such as
Supabase, without strict access controls. 

 KEYS TO THE KINGDOM: A DEFENDER'S GUIDE TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNT
MONITORING (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mandiant uses a three-pillar approach to privileged account
monitoring (PAM). The prevention pillar focuses on identifying all
identities that can change system state, alter security policy, or
reach sensitive data and tiering them into a hierarchy of privileged
access. The detection pillar focuses on distinguishing PAM-related
detections from regular abuse. The response pillar focuses on ensuring
that break-glass accounts work and customizing an incident response
plan for privileged accounts. 

 CODE-IN-THE-MIDDLE: AN INTRODUCTION TO IR (23 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Traditional EDR evasion methods, such as runtime packers and
post-compilation obfuscation, are increasingly ineffective due to
high-entropy signatures and recognizable patterns, prompting a shift
toward compile-time obfuscation using the LLVM Intermediate
Representation. This approach applies transformations like control
flow flattening and API call hashing during compilation, rather than
after. IRvana is a tool that leverages LLVM IR for fileless execution
by using lli.exe to directly interpret obfuscated IR files directly.
It achieves strong static detection bypass while acknowledging that
dynamic behavioral detection remains challenging. Security teams
should focus their detection efforts on behavioral analysis and
process injection techniques, rather than relying solely on static
signatures, as IR-based evasion makes traditional binary analysis
significantly more challenging.

 HOW TO USE IP REPUTATION TO REDUCE DWELL TIME, STOP DATA
EXFILTRATION, AND MINIMIZE ALERT FATIGUE (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Used effectively, IP reputation can reduce noise, improve detection
accuracy, and support zero trust initiatives. But its real value
depends on how it's applied. Read Intrusion's guide [12] to learn how
to wield it to your advantage – within context, in real time, and as
part of a broader security strategy. Read the blog [12] 

 INTRODUCING AARDVARK: OPENAI'S AGENTIC SECURITY RESEARCHER (4 MINUTE
READ) [13] 

 Aardvark is OpenAI's new autonomous security research agent. Now in
private beta, it is designed to help developers and security teams
find and fix vulnerabilities. It continuously scans code repositories,
prioritizes risks, and proposes targeted patches using AI-powered
reasoning. 

 BUNKERWEB (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Open-source and next-generation Web Application Firewall (WAF). Being
a full-featured web server (based on NGINX under the hood), it will
protect your web services to make them secure by default.

 AUSTRALIA WARNS OF BADCANDY INFECTIONS ON UNPATCHED CISCO DEVICES (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Australia's ASD reported that over 400 Cisco IOS XE devices have been
compromised with BadCandy webshell malware since July, exploiting
CVE-2023-20198, a critical vulnerability that allows remote attackers
to create administrative accounts and deploy Lua-based webshells with
root privileges. The webshell persists until the device is rebooted,
but can be easily reintroduced on unpatched systems, allowing
attackers to detect its removal and re-exploit the same endpoints.
Organizations must immediately patch affected Cisco IOS XE devices and
follow the vendor's hardening guidelines, as state-sponsored actors,
including Salt Typhoon, continue to exploit this two-year-old
vulnerability for persistent network access. 

 ECLIPSE FOUNDATION REVOKES LEAKED OPEN VSX TOKENS FOLLOWING WIZ
DISCOVERY (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The Eclipse Foundation revoked a small number of leaked Open VSX
tokens after Wiz discovered some Visual Studio Code extensions
exposing access tokens in public repositories. The investigation
showed that the leaks were due to developer mistakes, not a
compromise. Eclipse has introduced new token formats, tightened
security, improved revocation procedures, and is scanning for
malicious patterns. 

 FIREWALLS AND VPNS ARE SO COMPLEX NOW, THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOU
LESS SECURE (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Organizations using Cisco or Citrix VPNs are nearly seven times more
likely to experience a ransomware attack. This is due to the growing
complexity of properly securing on-premises VPNs. SonicWall VPN users
were the second most likely to be breached, with a 5.8 times increased
rate of incidence.
