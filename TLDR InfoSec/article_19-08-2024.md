ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 AUTOCANADA INVESTIGATING CYBERSECURITY BREACH, AS IT ANNOUNCES LOSS
FROM PREVIOUS INCIDENT (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AutoCanada reported a cybersecurity breach on August 11, potentially
disrupting operations. This follows a separate incident involving CDK
Global's software outage in June, which contributed to AutoCanada's
$33.1 million Q2 loss. The company is investigating the extent of the
latest breach and its impact on data security. 

 460K IMPACTED BY KOOTENAI HEALTH RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Kootenai Health, an Idaho-based healthcare provider, reported a data
breach affecting over 460,000 individuals. The incident involved
network access and data exfiltration of personal and health
information. 

 GOOGLE WILL UPDATE PIXEL PHONES TO REMOVE VERIZON'S UNSAFE DEMO APP
(2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security researchers discovered a vulnerable app called Showcase.apk
that was included in numerous Pixels' firmware without any way to
remove it. Google has clarified that this app is used in Verizon demo
phones and has committed to removing it in a future update. There is
no evidence that the app has been exploited as an attacker would first
require physical access and a user's password to install the app,
which provides numerous other attack vectors.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SSRF: A COMPLETE GUIDE TO EXPLOITING ADVANCED SSRF VULNERABILITIES
(11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This is a guide on exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities. It begins by
explaining what SSRFs are and how to exploit basic SSRF
vulnerabilities before discussing how to bypass common defenses like
host and protocol allowlisting. The guide then provides an
introduction to some advanced SSRFs like SSRFs in PDF generators,
second order SSRFs, blind SSRFs, and SSRFs via DNS rebinding. 

 REUSABLE WORKFLOW IS GOOD‚Ä¶ UNTIL YOU REALIZE YOUR IDENTITY IS ALSO
REUSABLE BY ANYONE (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Keyless signing is used in conjunction with sigstore by organizations
to sign artifacts to enable artifact attestation. A novel attack
method shows that if a repository publishes a reusable workflow to
sign artifacts using sigstore, an attacker can use that workflow to
sign artifacts with a SAN of the reusable workflow's repository. The
researcher does not believe that this is a worrisome threat as they
could only find two repositories that the attack would actually work
against and even then the impact would depend on how the potential
victim verified the signature. 

 BUCKET MONOPOLY: BREACHING AWS ACCOUNTS THROUGH SHADOW RESOURCES (12
MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Researchers have discovered a novel attack technique in AWS whereby
an attacker can create S3 buckets that utilize the naming system of
AWS services to in some cases even achieve RCE. When certain features
in Cloudformation, Glue, EMR, Sagemaker, ServiceCatalog, or Codestar
are first used, AWS creates an S3 bucket with a scheme such as
cf-templates-- (for Cloudformation templates). If an attacker were to
create a bucket with a guessed hash that matches the one that AWS
would create for an account, the attacker would control the bucket and
its contents. AWS has fixed the vulnerabilities in all services other
than Codestar, which is not accepting new customers.

 INTRODUCING AUTOMATIC SSL/TLS: SECURING AND SIMPLIFYING ORIGIN
CONNECTIVITY (11 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Cloudflare offers various options to control encryption between
Cloudflare and origin servers that range from never encrypting to
following the client request's encryption mode to always using TLS. To
simplify the decision process for Cloudflare customers, Cloudflare
introduced the SSL/TLS Recommender which would scan origin pages to
suggest the best encryption settings. However, Cloudflare found that
only 30% of customers were enabling the chosen setting in the UI. To
increase adoption, Cloudflare is introducing Automatic SSL/TLS, which
will automatically enable the SSL/TLS Recommender's recommended
setting. 

 EXPLOITING HUGGING FACE'S ASSISTANTS TO EXTRACT USERS' DATA (5 MINUTE

 This article demonstrates how Hugging Face's Chat is vulnerable to
techniques like Sleepy Agent and Image Markdown Rendering, which can
be exploited to extract users' data. These vulnerabilities allow
attackers to manipulate the AI model to extract sensitive information
like email addresses without the user's knowledge. Users should be
cautious when using AI assistants and read the system prompts to avoid
falling victim to data extraction attacks.
