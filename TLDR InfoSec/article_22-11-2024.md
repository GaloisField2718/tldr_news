STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APPLYING TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT TO DETECTION ENGINEERING (12 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Test-Driven Development is a software engineering philosophy that
often uses an Arrange-Act-Assert design pattern where a state is set
up, an action is taken, and then it is determined whether the results
were what was expected. In detection engineering, the Arrange step can
be modeled by deploying detection logic and setting up a test system.
The Act step would then involve executing a test/tool/malware sample.
The Assert step would evaluate what response was taken. Depending on
the maturity and precision of the alert, the Assert step may make sure
that the logs which observe the action are collected, a detection is
fired off, or preventative action is taken. 

 INTRODUCING RESOURCE CONTROL POLICIES (RCPS) TO CENTRALLY RESTRICT
ACCOUNT ACCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Resource Control Policies is a new AWS feature that allows users to

central control over the maximum permissions of IAM users and roles by
offering central control over the maximum resources on AWS resources.
At launch, RCPs can apply to resources of the following AWS services:
S3, STS, KMS, SQS, and Secrets Manager. 

 LEVELING UP FUZZING: FINDING MORE VULNERABILITIES WITH AI (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Google's AI-powered fuzzing project, OSS-Fuzz, found 26 new
