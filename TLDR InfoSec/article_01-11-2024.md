ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

its systems were breached. 

 ITALIAN POLITICIANS EXPRESS ALARM AT LATEST DATA BREACH ALLEGEDLY
AFFECTING 800,000 CITIZENS (1 MINUTE READ) [8]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BYPASSING NOEXEC AND EXECUTING ARBITRARY BINARIES (7 MINUTE READ) [9]


 Fileless execution is the process of executing a file from memory
without it ever hitting the filesystem. Most techniques require ptrace
or mmap and thus fail in read-only or noexec filesystems. This article
presents a bash one-liner that only requires the bash, cat, cut,
base64, and dd core utils. The one-liner works by obtaining a binary
or backdoor from an external source, creating a memory-backed file
descriptor, launching a child process, then using dd to overwrite the
instruction pointer from the child process with shell code which
executes the external binary from the memory-backed file descriptor.
Perl and PHP variants are provided. 

 2024 LOOKS SET TO BE ANOTHER RECORD-BREAKING YEAR FOR RANSOMWARE ‚Äî

2024 is set to break records for ransomware profits. Four victims have
paid eight-figure ransoms, including Change Healthcare's $22M payment.
This article goes into how ransomware is evolving and the continuous
threat it poses. 

 BREAKING THE BARRIER (7 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Spectre vulnerabilities still live in recent Intel and AMD
processors, affecting speculation barriers (IBPB). The security flaw
allows attackers to bypass process isolation and leak sensitive data
across processes. In this article, researchers show the first
practical cross-process Spectre attack, which successfully leaked root
passwords.

 AWS IDENTITY CENTER SIMPLIFIES CALLS TO AWS SERVICES WITH SINGLE
IDENTITY CONTEXT (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 AWS has enabled the use of a single identity context to propagate the
identity of users requesting access to AWS services. Prior to this
release, developers that wanted to use trusted identity propagation
had to call a service with separate IAM role sessions for services
that can authorize access by user and a separate one for only logging
the identity. Now, AWS will use the sts:identify_context to authorize
user access.
