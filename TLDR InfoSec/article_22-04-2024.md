deployed with Megazord malware since August 2023. 

 FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS SHUTS DOWN SYSTEMS AFTER CYBERATTACK (4
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Frontier Communications has shut down operations after suffering a
cyberattack on April 14 that resulted in the theft of PII. Containment
efforts involved taking systems offline, leading to material
operational disruptions. Frontier disclosed the breach impacted
"portions" of its IT environment in an SEC filing but did not provide

 GITHUB COMMENTS ABUSED TO PUSH MALWARE VIA MICROSOFT REPO URLS (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat actors are exploiting a GitHub flaw to distribute malware
through URLs linked to a Microsoft repository, tricking users into
thinking the files are safe. This is accomplished by leaving a comment
with an uploaded file in a Microsoft repository in GitHub, which
uploads the file to GitHub CDN associated with Microsoft's repository,
allowing the attacker to make the URLs look more trustworthy. GitHub
and Microsoft have been contacted regarding this issue, but the
distribution of malware continues through Microsoft's GitHub
repository.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT IS SERVER-SIDE TEMPLATE INJECTION? (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This blog dives into server-side template injection, how it can
occur, how to identify attempts, and how to set one up. Server-side
template injection is when an attacker uses native template syntax to
inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed
server-side. 

 BACKDOORING DOTNET APPLICATIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog post explains how to modify and add functionality to a
dotnet application by manipulating its binary disassembly. The author
demonstrates the process of injecting custom code into the application
and reassembling it to create a backdoor. The manual approach
described involves working with the disassembled code, adding new
instructions, and reassembling the application to achieve the desired
modifications without causing errors. 

 HOW ATTACKERS CAN OWN A BUSINESS WITHOUT TOUCHING THE ENDPOINT (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Hackers are targeting cloud apps and identities without touching
