 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Phishing has evolved. Today's attackers use AI-generated voices,
videos, and interactive deepfakes of company executives. They fool 99%
of people.

Adaptive Security - backed by $55M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z -
is the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered
social engineering [4]. Adaptive trains your team with tools that stay
one step ahead:

 	* Deepfake phishing simulations featuring your real executives in
realistic attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, personalized training content tailored for each
employee
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that reveals what attackers can learn from
your public data

>> BOOK A DEMO [4] and chat with a custom interactive deepfake of
your boss

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 QUANTUM ROUTE REDIRECT PHAAS TARGETS MICROSOFT 365 USERS WORLDWIDE (4
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Quantum Route Redirect phishing-as-a-service platform leverages
~1,000 pre-configured domains with automated bot filtering to steal
Microsoft 365 credentials across 90 countries (76% US-targeted), using
specific URL patterns matching "/([\w\d-]+.){2}[\w]{,3}/quantum.php/"
and hosting on legitimate compromised domains to evade detection. The
platform redirects humans to credential-harvesting pages while sending
security scanning tools to benign sites. Security teams should
implement URL filtering that targets the identified pattern, deploy
account compromise monitoring, and recognize phishing lures that mimic
DocuSign, payment notifications, and QR codes. Quantum Route Redirect
represents an evolution in PhaaS sophistication similar to VoidProxy
and Tycoon2FA campaigns. 

 HITACHI-OWNED GLOBALLOGIC ADMITS DATA STOLEN ON 10K CURRENT AND
FORMER STAFF (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 GlobalLogic, owned by Hitachi, suffered a significant data breach
that exposed the personal and financial data of over 10,000 current
and former staff members. The attack, attributed to the Clop
ransomware group, exploited vulnerabilities in the Oracle E-Business
Suite. Clop focuses on stealing and leaking data while pressuring
victims for payment. Oracle has issued emergency patches to counter
these attacks. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT TRIOFOX ZERO-DAY TO DEPLOY MALICIOUS PAYLOADS USING
ANTI-VIRUS FEATURE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Mandiant discovered a critical zero-day in
Gladinet's Triofox file-sharing platform. The vulnerability allowed
unauthenticated attackers to login to the platform by changing the
HTTP host header to localhost. The attackers then configured the
anti-virus scanner path to a malicious batch script.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW GLASSWORM WORMED ITS WAY BACK INTO DEVELOPERS' CODE — AND WHAT
IT SAYS ABOUT OPEN SOURCE SECURITY (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The GlassWorm self-propagating worm resurfaced two weeks after
eradication, infecting three new OpenVSX VS Code extensions (with over
10,000 downloads) and GitHub repositories using invisible Unicode
characters and a blockchain-based C2 infrastructure, with victims
including global enterprises and Middle Eastern government entities.
The Russia-based attack steals GitHub credentials, pushes malicious
AI-generated commits appearing as legitimate code changes, and
exploits OpenVSX's lack of manual code review resources. Security
teams should whitelist only trusted extension publishers, disable
auto-updates, monitor for credential harvesting and abnormal outbound
connections, and treat developer toolchains with the same security
rigor as production infrastructure, as automated scanning alone cannot
reliably stop these supply chain attacks. 

 TIPS FOR RELIABLE SPLIT-SECOND DNS REBINDING IN CHROME AND SAFARI (7
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 DNS rebinding attacks occur when an attacker can trick a victim into
leaking data by having the victim first communicate with the
attacker's public server and then switching the DNS record to point to
a private server. In Safari, a private IP address will be prioritized
over a public IP address, but an attacker can circumvent this by
delaying the DNS response with the private IP address. In Chrome, IPv6
will be prioritized over IPv4, allowing an attacker to send an IPv6
response with a public IP address and then an IPv4 response with a
private IP address. In both cases, the attacker blocks the user from
their server after connection, forcing the browser to rebind to the
private IP. 

 NO PLACE LIKE LOCALHOST: UNAUTHENTICATED REMOTE ACCESS VIA TRIOFOX
VULNERABILITY CVE-2025-12480 (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Mandiant has uncovered a significant security flaw in the Triofox
file-sharing platform (tracked as CVE-2025-12480), which allows
attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the Host header to
impersonate “localhost.” This gave unauthorized access to critical
admin configuration pages, enabling the creation of privileged
accounts. Attackers can exploit this to upload and execute arbitrary
files, abusing Triofox's anti-virus feature to run malicious scripts
with high privileges. The vulnerability is now patched, but
organizations using Triofox should urgently update, check for rogue
admin accounts, audit anti-virus configuration, and monitor for
unusual administrator and SSH activity.

 EUROPEAN COMMISSION MOVES TO LOOSEN GDPR FOR AI AND COOKIE TRACKING
(5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The EU's leaked "Digital Omnibus" proposal would shift cookie
tracking from opt-in to opt-out by moving regulation from ePrivacy
Directive to GDPR, explicitly permit AI training on personal data
under "legitimate interest" without consent, and narrow sensitive data
protections to only data that directly reveals protected
characteristics. Companies would no longer need consent management for
most cookies, but must document legitimate interest justifications,
while privacy advocates warn this fundamentally weakens GDPR's core
protections. Security professionals should prepare for the November 19
formal unveiling by reviewing data processing practices, documenting
AI training justifications, and reassessing compliance frameworks for
the shift from explicit consent to legitimate interest models. 

 APT37 HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE FIND HUB IN ANDROID DATA-WIPING ATTACKS (4
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 North Korean APT37/KONNI actors are targeting South Koreans via
KakaoTalk spear-phishing with digitally-signed MSI files that deploy
AutoIT scripts which establish persistence, deliver
RemcosRAT/QuasarRAT/RftRAT, and steal Google/Naver credentials to
access Find Hub for GPS tracking and remote Android device wiping. The
attackers are exploiting stolen credentials to execute factory resets
three times, preventing recovery, use GPS data to time attacks when
victims are outside, then hijack compromised KakaoTalk PC sessions to
spread malware laterally through contacts. Organizations should
enforce MFA on Google accounts, verify messenger file senders via
direct calls before opening attachments, and maintain accessible
recovery accounts. This attack abuses legitimate Find Hub features
rather than exploiting vulnerabilities. 

 OLLAMA, NVIDIA FLAWS PUT AI INFRASTRUCTURE AT RISK (4 MINUTE READ)
[18] 

 Security researchers have uncovered critical vulnerabilities in
Ollama and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server that could allow for remote
code execution, exposing companies to significant risks in their AI
infrastructure. These flaws, now fixed, reflect a shift in AI security
research from attacking models to probing the underlying
infrastructure.
