 AZURE ADMINS? MICROSOFT'S MFA MANDATE IS HERE - BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE A HEADACHE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If you're navigating Microsoft's MFA requirement for Azure admin
access, you're not alone. But did you know that you can use Cisco Duo
to meet this requirement [4] through Entra ID External Authentication
Methods.

In this recorded webinar [4], experts from Microsoft Security and
Cisco Duo reveal how organizations are:

 	* Meeting the MFA mandate without disrupting admin workflows.
 	* Easily protecting logins to Microsoft Azure and more with Duo
 	* Using MFA as a bridge to implement advanced identity security

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 IOS AND ANDROID JUICE JACKING DEFENSES HAVE BEEN TRIVIAL TO BYPASS
FOR YEARS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Juice jacking attacks are when an attacker hides a malicious device
inside a USB charging cable that either runs malware or downloads
files upon connecting to a target. Apple and Android have attempted to
mitigate this risk by requiring users of phones to confirm that they
want to allow access to their files. A new attack first connects as a
USB input device and pairs as a Bluetooth keyboard. It then uses USB
PD Data Role swap to connect as a USB host and accesses files by using
the Bluetooth keyboard to accept prompts. 

 HITACHI VANTARA TAKES SERVERS OFFLINE AFTER AKIRA RANSOMWARE ATTACK
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hitachi Vantara, a subsidiary of Hitachi that provides data storage,
infrastructure systems, cloud management, and ransomware recovery
services, announced that it has proactively taken down some of its
servers due to detecting a ransomware attack in its network. A source
has informed that the attack was carried out by the Akira ransomware
gang, which has stolen data and dropped ransom notes on affected
systems. 

 CRITICAL COMMVAULT FLAW ALLOWS FULL SYSTEM TAKEOVER – UPDATE NOW (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical flaw in Commvault software allows hackers to remotely take
full control of systems. Enterprises are advised to patch against
CVE-2025-34028 to prevent immediate attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SHADOWPUPPET: ANALYSING UNSTRUCTURED DATA USING SEMANTIC SCATTER
PLOTS (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Semantic scatter plots help uncover patterns in large datasets by
grouping similar data points on a graph, allowing for a more precise
visualization of relationships. Shadowpuppet utilizes these plots to
analyze unstructured data, like leaked communications from cyber
extortion groups. By leveraging embedding models and dimension
reduction, Shadowpuppet offers an intuitive method for exploring and
visualizing complex data in threat intelligence analysis. 

 WARGAMING INSIGHTS: IS INVESTING IN A SOC WORTH IT? (5 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 A cybersecurity study used Markov Chain simulations to compare two
defense strategies: a prevention-only approach versus a detection and
response approach. In the prevention-only strategy, attackers had a
49% success probability with about 2 attempts. Adding a 10% detection
probability reduced success rates to 26% and increased the number of
attempts to 3.84. The simulation showed that detection capabilities
are more effective than layered defenses, as detection success rates
of 30% provide equivalent protection to three layers of 50%-effective
preventive controls, highlighting the SOC as a powerful security force
multiplier. 

 HOW POSTAL CODE DATA IMPACTS CYBERSECURITY, PRIVACY, AND FRAUD
PREVENTION (3 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Postal codes play a vital role in cybersecurity by facilitating fraud
detection through Address Verification Services and e-commerce
analysis. To safeguard postal code data, organizations should
implement strategies such as limiting internal access, encrypting
data, utilizing secure APIs, and regularly updating datasets. As
postal codes evolve into components of digital identity verification,
ensuring their security and accuracy is crucial to protect users from
cyber threats and privacy invasions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MCP-SCAN (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 MCP-Scan is a security tool for checking MCP servers for common
vulnerabilities, prompt injections, and tool poisoning. It scans
server configurations and tool descriptions to detect security issues.
Users can run MCP-Scan using simple commands such as "uvx
mcp-scan@latest" or "npx mcp-scan@latest." 

 INTRODUCING HANALYZER: AN OPEN-SOURCE TOOL TO SECURE YOUR HANA
DATABASES (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Anvil Secure's HANAlyzer is an open-source tool that automates
security checks on SAP HANA databases. It generates reports using
SAP's security checklist to identify and address vulnerabilities
efficiently. HANAlyzer is designed to be easily deployed on multiple
platforms. It simplifies the assessment and security of SAP HANA
environments. 

 KYE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Know Your Enemies (KYE) helps you check external access to your AWS
account by analyzing IAM Role trust policies and S3 bucket policies.
It identifies third-party vendors with access to your resources and
supports defining trusted AWS accounts. By running the script, you can
detect IAM roles vulnerable to the confused deputy problem and
generate a markdown report for sharing with your security team.

 THE FUTURE OF CLOUD AND SECURITY OPERATIONS: ANALYZING PANW'S CORTEX
CLOUD BET (12 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This post looks at how Palo Alto Networks has driven convergence
between SOC and cloud security. Through a series of acquisitions, PANW
developed Cortex Cloud, which unifies XDR, XSIAM, CSPM, CNAPP, SOAR,
and AppSec, to enable security analysts to triage alerts from code to
runtime while reducing response times and costs. Cortex Cloud will
still need to face challenges in onboarding automation playbooks and
resolving differing workflows between SOC teams, devs, and cloud
engineers. 

 IAM IDENTITY CENTER RELEASES NEW SDK PLUGIN TO STREAMLINE TOKEN
EXCHANGE WITH AN EXTERNAL IDENTITY PROVIDER (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Trusted Identity Propagation (TIP) streamlines the exchange of IdP
tokens for IAM Identity Center, enabling precise access controls to
AWS resources based on IdP usage and group memberships. This new SDK
plugin automates the token exchange process and creation of
identity-aware credentials. The plugin is currently available for the
Java 2.0 and JavaScript v3 SDKs. 

 BSIDES SEATTLE 2025: REBUILDING TRUST IN SYSTEMS IN THE AGE OF NHIS
(6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The BSides Seattle 2025 cybersecurity conference focused on
rebuilding trust in a landscape dominated by non-human identities
(NHIs). Key figures, including Wendy Nather, Heather Flanagan, and
Maya Kaczorowski, emphasized that most security systems fail due to
unrealistic expectations of human behavior, overlooking the fact that
non-human identities, such as APIs and service accounts, outnumber
humans and possess greater privileges. The conference advocated for a
shift to contextual identity models based on attestation, recommending
ephemeral, task-bound identities with minimal privileges that can be
cryptographically verified.
