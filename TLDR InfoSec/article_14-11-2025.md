 WEBINAR: HOW REDDIT MATURED ACCESS MANAGEMENT WITH
1PASSWORD (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Weak and compromised passwords are the #1 cause of breaches, and they
leave IT teams struggling with fragmented access management and manual
onboarding/offboarding processes. Reddit was dealing with all these
challenges and more. They needed a solution that reduced credential
risk without slowing down their employees.

In this webinar, Reddit's Sr. Manager of Enterprise Security &
Systems, Nick Fohs, shares the inside story of how his team used
1Password to manage credentials across the entire company. You'll get
a first-hand look at the problems they faced, and the impact 1Password
has had on security and efficiency. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 67,000 FAKE NPM PACKAGES FLOOD REGISTRY IN WORM-LIKE SPAM ATTACK
(5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cybersecurity researchers uncovered a massive spam campaign flooding
npm with over 67,000 fake packages dubbed "IndonesianFoods." The
worm-like attack, active since early 2024, exploits dormant JavaScript
files requiring manual execution to bypass security scanners.
Attackers likely monetize the campaign through the Tea protocol by
artificially inflating impact scores to earn cryptocurrency tokens,
while creating a self-replicating network that strains registry
infrastructure and pollutes search results. 

 CL0P RANSOMWARE LISTS NHS UK AS VICTIM, DAYS AFTER WASHINGTON POST
BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The Cl0p ransomware group claimed the NHS UK as a victim on November
11, days after breaching The Washington Post by exploiting
CVE-2025-61882, a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS
9.8) in Oracle E-Business Suite versions 12.2.3-12.2.14. The
vulnerability was exploited beginning August 2025 before Oracle's
October 4 emergency patch, with attacks accelerating after Scattered
Lapsus$ Hunters leaked proof-of-concept code on October 3, enabling
Cl0p and FIN11 to conduct synchronized data-exfiltration campaigns
against hundreds of organizations. Organizations running Oracle EBS
must immediately apply the October 2025 patch, conduct forensic
reviews dating back to August, and monitor for connections to
suspicious IP addresses 200.107.207.26 and 185.181.60.11. 

 SUSPECTED FORTINET ZERO DAY EXPLOITED IN THE WILD (2 MINUTE READ) [7]


 A suspected zero-day path traversal vulnerability in Fortinet
firewall devices is actively being exploited to create admin-level
user accounts through HTTP POST requests to
/api/v2.0/cmdb/system/admin%3F/../../../../../cgi-bin/fwbcgi.
Attackers are deploying payloads from 15 source IP addresses,
including 107.152.41.19 and 185.192.70.x ranges and 64.95.13.8, using
specific username/password pairs like "Testpoint/AFT3$tH4ck" and
"trader1/3eMIXX43". Organizations with exposed Fortinet management
interfaces should promptly investigate for unauthorized admin
accounts, monitor for connections to these IPs, and look for
suspicious POST requests to the endpoint while awaiting vendor
patches.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CREATING A “TWO-FACE” RUST BINARY ON LINUX (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A “two-face” binary is a binary that contains a malicious program
designed to run on a target host and a benign binary that executes on
any other host. To ensure that the malicious program runs only on the
target host, it is encrypted with a key derived from the target's disk
partition UUIDs. The author of this article developed a twoface Rust
binary to implement this process, which also includes defenses to
prevent detection of the decrypted binary. 

 CONFIGURING THE AWS WAF ANTI-DDOS MANAGED RULE GROUP FOR YOUR
RESOURCES AND CLIENTS (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS WAF provides an Anti-DDOS managed rule group to detect and
mitigate HTTP DDOS events. By default, the rule group uses a
JavaScript challenge for all GET requests with low or medium suspicion
and blocks all GET requests with high suspicion of contributing to
DDoS attacks. This post provides ways to customize the rule group for
scenarios where clients don't support the JavaScript challenge,
clients can't use the WAF client integration, non-challengeable
requests overwhelm resources, and when challengeable requests
overwhelm resources before they're blocked. 

 PRACTICAL LLM SECURITY ADVICE FROM THE NVIDIA AI RED TEAM (6 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The NVIDIA AI Red Team has observed three common vulnerabilities in
the implementation of AI systems. The first vulnerability involves
directly executing LLM-generated code, which could lead to remote code
execution in the case of direct or indirect prompt injection. The
second vulnerability is related to insufficient access controls in RAG
data sources, which could allow a user to read data they are not
privileged to read or write data to the data store. The third
vulnerability is related to active content rendering of LLM outputs,
which could lead to information leakage via images or other network
requests.

 Shannon is an AI pentester whose goal is to break your web app before
someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your
code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as
injection attacks and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is
actually exploitable.

 MOZILLA FIREFOX GETS NEW ANTI-FINGERPRINTING DEFENSES (2 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Mozilla has announced that, beginning in the recently released
Firefox 145, further fingerprinting blocking will be implemented,
dropping the percentage of user trackability to 20%. The specific
enhancements block requests to discover installed fonts, hardware
details, number of processor cores, multi-touch support, and
dock/taskbar dimensions. The enhancements will initially be rolled out
for users in Private Browsing who set their Enhanced Tracking
Protection to Strict. 

 NHS SUPPLIER ENDS PROBE INTO RANSOMWARE ATTACK THAT CONTRIBUTED TO
PATIENT DEATH (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Synnovis has completed an exhaustive 18-month investigation into a
crippling ransomware attack in June 2024 that affected nearly a
million NHS patients, severely disrupted London pathology services and
leading to a patient's death. The probe struggled with fragmented
data. While no ransom was paid and systems were replaced, many
patients must still wait for official notification if their data was
compromised. 

 GOOGLE SUES TO DISRUPT CHINESE SMS PHISHING TRIAD (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Google filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against
25 individuals connected to Lighthouse, a Chinese
phishing-as-a-service toolkit that has compromised over 1 million
victims across 120 countries by spoofing USPS, toll road operators,
e-commerce sites, and financial institutions via SMS. The operation
captures payment card data through fake mobile sites and then exploits
the legitimate Apple Pay and Google Pay enrollment processes by
tricking victims into providing one-time authentication codes,
enabling attackers to load stolen cards onto mobile wallets they
control. Security teams should monitor SMS gateways for brand
impersonation, educate users to verify unexpected payment requests
through official channels, and watch for unusual mobile wallet
enrollment patterns that could indicate credential theft.
