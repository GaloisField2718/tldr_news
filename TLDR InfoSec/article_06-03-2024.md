 TO COMBAT _ACTIVE CLOUD RISK_, YOU NEED TO SEE WHAT‚ÄôS HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW (SPONSOR) [5] 

 Cloud attacks are fast, and operating in the cloud securely requires
a new mindset. Sysdig has introduced the 5/5/5 Benchmark for Cloud
Detection and Response [6] as a new standard for incident response: 5
seconds to detect, 5 minutes triage, and 5 minutes to respond.
To meet this benchmark, security teams need to focus on what‚Äôs
happening right now ‚Äî deployed applications ‚Äî not only
pre-delivery scanning. Runtime Insights [5] are key to identifying
in-use [5] packages, configs, permissions, and network connections
that pose an active risk.

‚Üí Read more about why runtime insights are required in the cloud
[5], the 5/5/5 Benchmark [6], and how Apree Health gained visibility
into active vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance [7].
