ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 REDTIGER MALWARE STEALS DATA, DISCORD TOKENS, AND EVEN WEBCAM IMAGES
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 RedTiger, an open-source Python-based infostealer repurposed by
cybercriminals, targets Discord gamers (especially French-speaking
users) to steal authentication tokens, payment information, browser
credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and webcam images while modifying
Discord to maintain persistent access even after password changes. The
malware evades detection by shutting down when it detects security
tools, employs "mass file and process spamming" (creating 100 random
files and launching 400 programs to hinder forensic analysis), and
exfiltrates stolen data via GoFile with Discord webhook notifications
to attackers. Security professionals should implement multi-factor
authentication on Discord accounts, avoid downloading software from
unverified sources, and recognize that legitimate security testing
tools are increasingly weaponized for credential theft campaigns. 

 LG UPLUS IS LATEST SOUTH KOREAN TELCO TO CONFIRM CYBERSECURITY
INCIDENT (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 LG Uplus, one of South Korea's largest telecom operators, has
reported a suspected data breach to Korea's national cybersecurity
watchdog KISA, but did not say when the results of its investigation
would be available. All three major Korean telcos have faced recent
cyber incidents, raising concerns about the country's digital
defenses. 

 AD AND PR GIANT DENTSU SAYS HACKERS STOLE MERKLE DATA (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 Japanese advertising giant Dentsu has revealed that its subsidiary,
Merkle, suffered a data breach that exposed sensitive information
about clients, suppliers, and employees. The breach was detected
following abnormal activity on Merkle's network, leading to some
systems being shut down.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING TO ENHANCE ACOUSTIC EAVESDROPPING ATTACKS
(PART 1 OF 4) (1 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers demonstrated that machine learning can significantly
enhance acoustic side-channel attacks by analyzing keyboard typing
sounds to reconstruct typed text with high accuracy, exploiting
acoustic emanations from physical keystrokes captured via microphones
or smartphones. The attacks leverage ML models trained on keystroke
audio patterns to classify individual key presses, achieving
reconstruction rates that pose realistic threats to password and
sensitive data entry in shared or public spaces. Security
professionals should educate users about acoustic eavesdropping risks
in public environments, consider acoustic shielding for sensitive
areas, and promote authentication methods less vulnerable to acoustic
side-channels like biometrics or hardware tokens, rather than typed
passwords. 

 HACKING WITH AI SASTS: AN OVERVIEW OF “AI SECURITY
ENGINEERS”/“LLM SECURITY SCANNERS” FOR PENETRATION TESTERS AND
SECURITY TEAMS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 An exploration of Almanax, Corgea, and ZeroPath Security's AI SAST
capabilities. The post uses three steps in its evaluation: code
retrieval and indexing, code scanning, and false positive detection,
deduplication, and severity rating, along with some miscellaneous
items like the ease of using the UIs. The author concludes that
ZeroPath is the best out of the products tested, followed by Corgea
and Almanax. 

 LOLMIL: LIVING OFF THE LAND MODELS AND INFERENCE LIBRARIES (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 PromptLock is a proof-of-concept malware developed by NYU researchers
to operate autonomously using an LLM hosted by the researchers. The
author of this post wanted to experiment with building a
post-exploitation tool that leverages the LLM included in Microsoft's
Copilot+ PCs to create malware that's not dependent on a Command and
Control (C2) Server. By providing the malware with tools to identify,
modify, and restart vulnerable services, they were able to exploit two
services using the LLM in a test environment.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DEEPFAKE ATTACKS SURGED 50X. ARE YOUR SECURITY DEFENSES READY?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 At Persona, we've seen deepfake attacks surge 50x, yet 85% of CISOs
say they lack GenAI-ready incident response plans. Workforce security
is no longer about _if_ you'll be targeted, but whether you're
prepared.

Persona verifies employees, contractors, and vendors in seconds —
automating identity checks to eliminate manual work and stop
impersonation attacks before they spread. Integrate Persona's
Workforce IDV solution with your existing security tech stack to
verify who's actually behind every login, device, and network. Learn
more now [11].

 KEEPING THE INTERNET FAST AND SECURE: INTRODUCING MERKLE TREE
CERTIFICATES (12 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Cloudflare and Chrome are testing Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) to
improve post-quantum signature performance, which are 20 times larger
than current ECDSA signatures (ML-DSA-44 signatures are 2,420 bytes vs
64 bytes for ECDSA-P256). MTCs reduce TLS handshakes to one signature,
one public key, and one Merkle inclusion proof by batching
certificates into Merkle trees with signed tree heads sent out-of-band
to clients, compared to today's five signatures and two public keys
per handshake. The deployment will use "bootstrap certificates" from
trusted CAs to validate MTCs via certificate transparency, starting
early 2026 with some Cloudflare and Chrome users to assess performance
and ossification issues. 

 SOCKTAIL (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SockTail is a compact binary that connects a device to a Tailscale
network and provides a local SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080. It is designed
for red team operations, enabling network access to a target system
without the need for complex port forwarding, persistent daemons, or
noisy tunnels. 

 CYBERRIDGE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 CyberRidge has developed a plug-and-play photonic encryption system
that transforms transmitted data into encrypted optical noise. This
shields data from interception, quantum analysis, and “harvest now,
decrypt later” attacks, aiming for post-quantum secure data
transmission.

 SSH LLM HONEYPOT CAUGHT A REAL THREAT ACTOR (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 A Beelzebub LLM-powered SSH honeypot successfully detected a genuine
threat actor who downloaded Perl backdoor scripts from a compromised
Joomla site. The attacker attempted to establish IRC-based
command-and-control (C&C) connections using "rootbox PerlBot v2.0" on
Undernet channels #rootbox and #c0d3rs-TeaM. Their tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) included downloading malware to
/tmp, attempting to escalate privileges with sudo, and deploying
botnet agents that connected to ix1.undernet.org:6667 for C&C
operations. Security teams can utilize LLM honeypots to gather
real-time threat intelligence and disrupt botnets by analyzing malware
configurations and reporting C&C infrastructure to hosting providers. 

 9 IN 10 EXCHANGE SERVERS IN GERMANY STILL RUNNING OUT-OF-SUPPORT
SOFTWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Germany's cybersecurity agency warns that over 90% of Exchange
servers in the country are using software that no longer receives
support or updates. This leaves thousands of organizations, including
hospitals and public institutions, vulnerable to critical security
threats and ransomware. Microsoft offers extended updates for a
limited time, but officials urge urgent upgrades or migration to avoid
total network compromise. 

 HACKERS USE NFC RELAY MALWARE TO CLONE TAP-TO-PAY ANDROID
TRANSACTIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Zimperium researchers discovered over 760 malicious Android apps
exploiting NFC and Host Card Emulation features to relay payment card
data in real-time to attackers via 70+ command-and-control servers and
Telegram bots, with fake banking apps impersonating Google Pay, VTB
Bank, and Santander across Russia, Poland, Brazil and other countries
to enable fraudulent tap-to-pay transactions without physical card
access, prompting recommendations to download apps only from Google
Play Store and implement stronger NFC permission controls.
