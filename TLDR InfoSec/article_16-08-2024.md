ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MACOS STEALER POSING AS LOOM IS SPREADING VIA GOOGLE ADS (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Moonlock Labs has uncovered a new AMOS stealer variant that spreads
by masquerading as the Loom screen recorder on Google Ads. In addition
to usual infostealer malware capabilities, this new variant contains
the capability to clone and swap legitimate apps such as a crypto
wallet to wipe victims' wallets. This variant also includes files that
suggest that it is targeting gamers. 

 AT HOME IN YOUR FIRMWARE: ANALYSIS OF CVE-2024-36877 (23 MINUTE READ)
[6] 

 A vulnerability in MSI SMM driver allowed attackers to run
unauthorized code by exploiting a buffer overflow. The exploit
involved setting a variable to corrupt SMRAM, leading to potential
system compromise. Mitigation required setting DataSize to 8 for
status message writing to physical memory. 

 PALO ALTO NETWORKS PATCHES UNAUTHENTICATED COMMAND EXECUTION FLAW IN
CORTEX XSOAR (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Palo Alto Networks patched a critical command execution flaw in its
Cortex XSOAR product, allowing attackers to run commands without
authentication. The company also addressed vulnerabilities in other
products like Prisma Access Browser and PAN-OS, releasing patches to
fix the issues. While no known attacks have occurred, Palo Alto
Networks is proactive about addressing cybersecurity threats in its
products.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLOUDFRONT WAF RECOMMENDATIONS (REDDIT THREAD) [8] 

 A Reddit user experienced a $9,000 bill due to a CloudFront WAF
bypass. A comment presented a list of suggestions to improve WAF usage
such as blocking the AWSManagedRulesAmazonIPReputationList list,
setting rate limits at various levels with COUNT actions to determine
baselines to block, restricting access to the S3 bucket, and blocking
geos that customers don't reside in. The comment also suggested using
AWS Shield Advanced, which gives access to the Shield Response Team
and has a WAF allowance included in its $3,000/month cost. 

 SPLITTING THE EMAIL ATOM: EXPLOITING PARSERS TO BYPASS ACCESS
CONTROLS (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article details an exploration of how email parsers handle the
more arcane parts of the RFC. It begins with background about ways
that the RFC treats some special characters like escapes and comments.
The article then details how the author utilized encoded words to
bypass access controls to obtain access to protected environments
using encoded words before taking it a step further to achieve RCE
using puny codes. Relevant tooling for automating encoded word
discovery with Turbo Intruder and fuzzing with punycode as well as a
CTF are included. 

 INSIDE THE "3 BILLION PEOPLE" NATIONAL PUBLIC DATA BREACH (10 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 The 3 Billion people nationwide data breach has led to leaked records
including names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. Data
aggregator NPD is facing a class action lawsuit over the breach.

 THE FIRST POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY STANDARDS ARE HERE (5 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 NIST has announced the first set of standards for post-quantum
cryptography: ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA. ML-KEM uses a lattice
system to create a secure communication channel whereas the other
algorithms are for creation and verification of digital signatures.
IBM's Dario Gil urges companies to start adopting these standards now
as threat actors may be stockpiling encrypted data to crack with a
quantum computer, which Gil theorizes should be available within the
next 10 years. 

 DETECTION AS CODE: A MATURITY FRAMEWORK (7 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post breaks Detection as Code (DaC) into four components:
language, testing, integration, and monitoring. When a team starts
adopting DaC, they may use markup languages before moving on to query
languages and finally general purpose programming languages. As teams
adopt testing for their DaC, they will likely begin with unit testing
before adopting other forms of testing like integration testing and
end-to-end testing. Teams will also add more monitoring and
integrations as they mature. A maturity matrix is included at the end
of the post. 

 WE WROTE THE CODE, AND THE CODE WON (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 NIST announced new post-quantum cryptography standards, including
SLH-DSA. Trail of Bits created a Rust implementation of SLH-DSA for
secure cryptographic use. Its open-source project, which focuses on
security and usability improvements, aids the transition to
post-quantum cryptography.
