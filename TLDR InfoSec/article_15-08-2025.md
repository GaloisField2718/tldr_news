 “FRANKENSTACK” SASE WON'T FIX SECURITY OR LAND THE JOB. REAL SASE
WILL. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 SASE leads the enterprise IT security market. But some vendors are
just rebranding point products as a “platform” to stay
competitive. That's not SASE—it's complexity, gaps, risk, and a
career liability.

To stay marketable and boost career options, IT pros need _real _SASE
experience. 

Cato built the first (and only) true SASE platform—converged,
cloud-native, intelligently secure by design. Our SASE EXPERT LEVEL 1
CERTIFICATION [4] IS A REAL ACCREDITATION THAT INCLUDES:

 	* What SASE _is_—and isn't
 	* Why architecture drives security and performance
 	* How to migrate to and implement SASE

Three hours. Self-paced. Always free.

GET CERTIFIED BY THE EXPERTS THAT BUILT SASE—BEFORE IT EVEN HAD A
NAME. APPLY NOW. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 MATRIX PROTOCOL BUGS COULD LET HACKERS SEIZE CONTROL OF SENSITIVE
CHAT ROOMS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Matrix Foundation identified two high-severity vulnerabilities
(CVE-2025-49090 and CVE-2025-54315) that allow attackers to hijack
creator privileges or predict room addresses, disrupting
communications used by government and military groups. These flaws
affect federated Matrix servers (external servers - internal ones are
unaffected) and were fixed in Room Version 12. Administrators are
urged to upgrade immediately and restrict access to trusted servers.
No exploits have been observed in the wild. 

 MANPOWER DISCLOSES DATA BREACH AFFECTING NEARLY 145K INDIVIDUALS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Manpower, one of the world's largest staffing companies, is notifying
nearly 145K individuals that attackers stole their data in a December
2024 attack. The stolen data includes passports, IDs, SSNs, addresses,
contact information, corporate communications, financial statements,
HR data, and confidential contracts and NDAs. The RandomHub ransomware
group stole the data, but the data has since been removed from its
website, suggesting that the ransom may have been paid. 

 FORTINET WARNS OF FORTISIEM PRE-AUTH RCE FLAW WITH EXPLOIT IN THE
WILD (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Fortinet is warning of a new critical (CVSS 9.8/10) pre-auth remote
code execution vulnerability affecting multiple branches of FortiSIEM.
The vulnerability is an OS command injection caused by “improper
neutralization of special elements.” Fortinet has also stated that
working exploit code is publicly available and urges immediate
remediation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 KUBERNETES SECURITY FUNDAMENTALS: NETWORKING (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Kubernetes clusters use a flat network that allows all pods to
communicate, which poses security risks. To secure the network, deploy
CNI plugins like Calico or Cilium that support policies, then set
default-deny ingress/egress rules, allowing only necessary traffic
between pods and namespaces. Essential measures include restricting
host networking, shielding cloud metadata from pod egress, and testing
network policies with application manifests before production. 

 CYBERSECURITY SPENDING SLOWS & SECURITY TEAMS SHRINK (2 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Security budgets are slowing to 4% YoY growth, the lowest in five
years, driving understaffed teams and delayed initiatives. Pressure
stems from geopolitics, tariffs, and macroeconomics. Budgets are
tightest in healthcare, services, retail, and hospitality, while
finance, insurance, and tech still grew more than 5% by prioritizing
cloud, IAM, SecOps automation, and zero trust. 

 HOW WE AUTOMATED GITHUB ACTIONS RUNNER UPDATES WITH CLAUDE (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Depot had an arduous process in which developers needed to spend
hours maintaining arm64 versions of GitHub Actions runners. The team
first developed a workflow in which Claude first attempted to apply
the Depot team's patch file and then cyclically modified it until it
applied successfully without removing any existing patches. The second
workflow involved Claude tracking upstream changes, summarizing them,
and highlighting any breaking changes.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CYBERARK'S $25B ACQUISITION BY PALO ALTO NETWORKS SIGNALS THE END OF
LEGACY PAM (SPONSOR) [11] 

 The mega-deal validates identity as security's new pillar [11], but
also exposes the limits of current solutions. Legacy PAM creates
security gaps between login and action - forcing organizations to
invest in sprawling, fragmented identity tools. The solution: Identity
security transformation that moves beyond static vaults to a Zero
Trust approach securing what happens AFTER login. StrongDM: Leave your
legacy PAM behind [11] 

 VELES (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Veles is Google's new open-source secret scanner. Built as a
standalone module within the OSV-SCALIBR ecosystem, it was designed to
detect leaked credentials in source code and artifacts. It currently
supports the detection of GCP API keys, GCP service account keys, and
RubyGems API keys. Veles is actively used at Google to scan internal
repositories and powers credential detection for deps.dev's hundreds
of millions of open-source packages. The tool will be integrated into
Google Cloud services, including Artifact Registry and Security
Command Center, with a future roadmap including expanded secret
detection types, automated validation, and remediation workflows. 

 VENDETECT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Vendetect is a CLI tool for automatically detecting censored and
copy/pasted code between repositories. 

 RECONPRO (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ReconPro is a specialized web reconnaissance tool designed for
cybersecurity professionals and bug bounty hunters. It provides
instant access to carefully curated Google dorks organized by
vulnerability type and risk level, significantly accelerating the
initial reconnaissance phase of security assessments.

 CHARON RANSOMWARE TARGETS MIDDLE EAST WITH APT ATTACK METHODS (4
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Charon is a new ransomware targeting Middle East public sector and
aviation organizations using advanced persistent threat tactics,
including DLL side-loading, process injection, and EDR evasion
techniques similar to China-linked Earth Baxia operations. The
ransomware employs partial file encryption with Curve25519/ChaCha20,
network propagation capabilities, and includes a dormant Dark-Kill
driver for disabling security tools via BYOVD attacks. The targeted
nature of attacks, evidenced by victim-specific ransom notes,
highlights the concerning convergence of APT-level sophistication with
ransomware operations. 

 PASSKEY LOGIN BYPASSED VIA WEBAUTHN PROCESS MANIPULATION (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 SquareX researchers showed a passkey bypass that doesn't break
cryptography but manipulates the WebAuthn flow via JavaScript
injection. By tricking users into installing a malicious browser
extension or exploiting site XSS, attackers can hijack
registration/authentication, impersonate users, or force password
fallback—even with Face ID—by forging WebAuthn API calls in the
browser. 

 FROM INTERNS TO INTELLIGENCE: HOW AGENTIC AI WILL TRANSFORM APPSEC
AND DEVSECOPS (5 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In this conference talk, Balaji Sundara introduces the concept of
agentic AI systems as a self-prompting, self-correcting, and
self-balancing orchestration system. Sundara suggests a multi-pronged
defense model that includes proactive measures like secure design
principles, reactive measures such as rollback for flawed decisions,
and detective measures such as human-in-the-loop monitoring. He also
stresses that APIs underpin AI agents and, therefore, agentic systems
inherit existing API issues and defenses.

authentication, preventing confidential documents from being left
unattended.

Cryptographic Provider that administrators can ignore.
