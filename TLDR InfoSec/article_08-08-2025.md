TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-08-08

 CATO NAMED A LEADER IN THE 2025 GARTNER MAGIC QUADRANT FOR SASE
PLATFORMS. AGAIN. (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Cloud growth. Hybrid work. Global expansion. IT complexity keeps
rising.

When Gartner defined SASE [4] (Secure Access Service Edge) to meet the
needs of modern enterprises, many vendors scrambled to
respond—forcing together networking and security point solutions or
acquiring technologies to fit the framework.

That's not true SASE. Cato SASE Cloud [4] is:

 	* A single, converged, cloud-native platform built from the ground
up
 	* Designed to eliminate decades of complexity and sprawl—not add
to it
 	* Real agility, performance, and security at scale

ARCHITECTURE MATTERS. READ THE FULL GARTNER MAGIC QUADRANT REPORT AND
SEE WHY CATO IS A LEADER. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 TREND MICRO CONFIRMS ACTIVE EXPLOITATION OF CRITICAL APEX ONE FLAWS
IN ON-PREMISE SYSTEMS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Trend Micro confirmed active exploitation of two critical command
injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-54948 and CVE-2025-54987) in
on-premise Apex One Management Console. Rated 9.4 CVSS, the flaws
allow pre-authenticated remote attackers to upload malicious code and
execute commands on affected installations through insufficient input
validation. Mitigations are available via the fix tool, with formal
patches expected mid-August 2025, though the fix disables Remote
Install Agent functionality. 

 VIBE CODING TOOL CURSOR'S MCP IMPLEMENTATION ALLOWS PERSISTENT CODE
EXECUTION (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Check Point researchers uncovered a new remote code execution
vulnerability in Cursor. The vulnerability, dubbed MCPoison, is caused
by Cursor allowing an MCP configuration that has been previously
approved to be updated without requiring a new approval. In this
attack, an attacker could introduce a benign MCP and then, once it's
approved, modify it to perform RCE or other malicious activity. 

 CRITICAL ZERO-DAYS CRACK OPEN CYBERARK AND HASHICORP PASSWORD VAULTS
(5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A team of researchers discovered nine zero-days in HashiCorp Vault
and five in CyberArk Conjur, which they were able to chain to achieve
RCE against both platforms. The researchers discovered that they could
trick Conjur into performing authentication against their own server
instead of an AWS server and then escalate privileges by
authenticating as a policy instead of a user. Conjur's “Policy
Factory” also allows for embedding Ruby in policies, leading to RCE.
The HashiCorp Vault vulnerabilities included username enumeration,
authentication lockout bypasses, MFA and certificate authentication
bypasses, and a privilege escalation from admin to root, which could
allow for RCE.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 PROMPT INJECTION ENGINEERING FOR ATTACKERS: EXPLOITING GITHUB COPILOT
(10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post demonstrates a prompt injection attack against GitHub
Copilot, where attackers file malicious issues with hidden prompts in
HTML `picture` tags, causing Copilot to insert backdoors when assigned
to implement fixes. The attack leverages fake conversation history to
manipulate the AI agent into secretly executing a malicious bash
script disguised as a “security setup,” ultimately installing
backdoored dependencies that accept commands via HTTP headers. The
technique exploits Copilot's inability to distinguish legitimate from
injected XML tags. Maintainers rarely scrutinize package lock file
modifications during code review. 

 WHY IS PREVENTATIVE SECURITY SO DIFFICULT? (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 While tools for detecting vulnerabilities are plentiful, there are
very few tools that seek to preventively eliminate full classes of
vulnerabilities. Preventative tooling is complex because often big
tech giants are the only ones equipped with the resources to address
the root causes, but they are not incentivized to aid their
competitors, environments differ, and new standards struggle to garner
support. AI tooling may aid in allowing for more catered automations,
but it is unlikely to fully eliminate issues. 

 RESEARCHERS DESIGN “PROMPTWARE” ATTACK WITH GOOGLE CALENDAR TO
TURN GEMINI EVIL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Researchers demonstrate a “promptware” attack using malicious
Google Calendar events to manipulate Gemini AI into controlling smart
home devices. The exploit uses indirect prompt injection via calendar
descriptions, triggering real-world actions. Google has now patched
the flaw, adding protections and confirmation dialogs for sensitive
actions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 FACTION (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 FACTION automates penetration testing reports, peer reviews, change
tracking, customized DOCX templates, and enables real-time
collaboration. 

 NOVAHYPERVISOR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 NovaHypervisor is an open-source Type-1 hypervisor designed
specifically for x64 Intel systems that operates below the kernel
level to provide enhanced security protection. It creates a
virtualized environment that can monitor and defend against
sophisticated kernel-level attacks by protecting critical system
structures like Exception Frame Records (EFR) and kernel memory
layouts. This defensive hypervisor technology enables real-time
detection and prevention of rootkits, kernel exploits, and other
advanced persistent threats that traditional security solutions
running at the kernel level might miss. 

 DROPZONE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Dropzone AI's agents can collect information from third-party
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security
Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR), Endpoint Detection and
Response (EDR), and cloud security tools such as Microsoft Defender,
Splunk, CrowdStrike, and AWS Security Hub.

 HACKER EXTRADITED TO US FOR STEALING $3.3 MILLION FROM TAXPAYERS (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Nigerian national Chukwuemeka Victor Amachukwu was extradited from
France to face charges for spearphishing attacks on U.S. tax
preparation businesses between 2019 and 2021. The attacker stole
personal data to file fraudulent tax returns and SBA loan
applications, netting $2.5 million in tax refunds and $819,000 in
loans from a total $3.3 million in damages. Amachukwu faces six
federal charges, including conspiracy to commit computer intrusions,
wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft, with potential sentences up
to 20 years per count. 

 RESEARCHERS UNCOVER ECSCAPE FLAW IN AMAZON ECS ENABLING CROSS-TASK
CREDENTIAL THEFT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 “ECScape” is a flaw in Amazon ECS on EC2 that allows
low-privilege containers to steal credentials from higher-privilege
tasks on the same instance, enabling privilege escalation and lateral
movement. Amazon advises isolating tasks, using AWS Fargate for true
separation, and enforcing least-privilege policies to mitigate risks. 

 'SAMOURAI' CRYPTOMIXER FOUNDERS PLEAD GUILTY TO MONEY LAUNDERING (2

 The founders of Samourai Wallet, a cryptocurrency mixer, pleaded
guilty to laundering over $200 million through their service, which
used features like Whirlpool and Ricochet to obscure illicit
transactions. They face prison time and must forfeit more than $200
million for their actions.
