ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CHINA-LINKED HACKERS EXPLOIT VMWARE ESXI ZERO-DAYS TO ESCAPE VIRTUAL
MACHINES (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Huntress observed Chinese-speaking threat actors exploiting three
VMware ESXi zero-days (CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and
CVE-2025-22226) to escape virtual machine isolation and gain full
hypervisor control. Evidence suggests the exploit toolkit was
developed as early as February 2024, over a year before Broadcom's
March 2025 disclosure. The multi-stage attack chain used a compromised
SonicWall VPN for initial access and deployed the VSOCKpuppet
backdoor, which communicates over VSOCK to bypass traditional network
monitoring entirely. Organizations should prioritize patching these
vulnerabilities and monitor for unusual VMCI/VSOCK activity between
guest VMs and hypervisors. 

 BREACHFORUMS HACKING FORUM DATABASE LEAKED, EXPOSING 324K ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 The latest version of the infamous BreachForums suffered a data
breach that leaked a database of user accounts. The breached data
includes display names, registration dates, IP addresses, and other
internal information. Many of the breached users' IPs route to loop
back, but over 70k records contain public IPs. 

 INSTAGRAM DATA LEAK EXPOSES SENSITIVE INFO OF 17.5M ACCOUNTS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Malwarebytes raised concerns about a trove of Instagram user
information being sold on the dark web. The breached data includes
usernames, emails, phone numbers, and partial location data. Instagram
has stated that there was no data breach, but rather an issue that
allowed external parties to send unrequested password reset emails.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ORM LEAKING MORE THAN YOU JOINED FOR (15 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 ORM Leak vulnerabilities extend beyond susceptible ORMs such as
Django and Prisma to any application that implements robust filtering
capabilities. This article details practical examples, including
Harbor CVE-2025-30086 (Beego ORM) and authentication bypasses via
Prisma operator injection via type coercion, and discusses multiple
techniques for bypassing naive protections, including exploiting
Beego's broken expression parsing, where non-relational fields in
filter expressions are overwritten by subsequent fields. Semgrep
detection rules for Django, Prisma, Beego, and Entity Framework ORMs
have been published to help identify these commonly overlooked
vulnerabilities. 

 TWO CVES, ZERO EGO: A MAILPIT STORY (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Mailpit is a lightweight email testing tool used in development that
recently had two notable security issues uncovered: a server-side
request forgery (SSRF) and a cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH)
flaw. The SSRF bug allowed attackers to abuse a proxy endpoint to
access internal services such as cloud metadata, while the WebSocket
issue allowed any website to connect and stream all captured emails
without authentication. The maintainer quickly fixed both issues in
new releases and coordinated CVEs, showing how respectful
communication, GitHub Security Advisories, and low-ego collaboration
between researchers and developers lead to fast, effective
vulnerability remediation. 

 ATTACKERS LOVE YOUR GITHUB ACTIONS TOO (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 GitHub ranks as the second most used CI/CD tool, but it also exposes
a large attack surface to attackers. GitHub Actions can
unintentionally expose secrets or overprovision tokens. Actions are
vulnerable to supply chain compromise via poisoned dependencies and
injection attacks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 TAILSNITCH (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Tailsnitch is a security auditing tool for Tailscale configurations
that scans tailnets for 50+ misconfigurations, overly permissive
access controls, and security best practice violations across seven
categories, including ACLs, authentication keys, and network exposure.
The tool supports severity filtering, interactive remediation mode,
JSON export for CI/CD integration, and SOC 2 evidence generation with
Common Criteria control mappings. Checks range from critical issues
like default allow-all policies and overly broad tagOwners to
informational items covering logging and DNS settings. 

 GIXY-NEXT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Gixy-Next (Gixy) is an open-source NGINX configuration security
scanner and hardening tool that statically analyzes nginx.conf files
to detect security misconfigurations, hardening gaps, and common
performance pitfalls before they reach production. It is an actively
maintained fork of Yandex's Gixy. 

 BINYARS (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 BinYars is a Binary Ninja plugin that integrates YARA-X into Binary
Ninja.

 MUDDYWATER LAUNCHES RUSTYWATER RAT VIA SPEAR-PHISHING ACROSS MIDDLE
EAST SECTORS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Iranian threat actor MuddyWater has been attributed to spear-phishing
campaigns targeting diplomatic, maritime, financial, and telecom
entities in the Middle East using a new Rust-based implant called
RustyWater (also known as Archer RAT/RUSTRIC). The malware, delivered
via malicious Word documents with VBA macros, establishes registry
persistence and supports asynchronous C2 communication for file
operations and command execution. This marks MuddyWater's continued
evolution away from PowerShell and VBS loaders toward more structured,
modular RAT capabilities. 

 EUROPOL ARRESTS 34 BLACK AXE MEMBERS IN SPAIN OVER €5.9M FRAUD AND
ORGANIZED CRIME (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Europol and Spanish police have dismantled a major Black Axe cell in
Spain, arresting 34 suspects across Seville, Madrid, Málaga, and
Barcelona for cyber-enabled fraud and violent organized crime.
Authorities link the Nigerian-origin syndicate to scams like business
email compromise and romance fraud, with losses over €5.93 million,
and report cash and bank account seizures alongside prior global
crackdowns on the group. 

 CYBERSECURITY CHANGES I EXPECT IN 2026 (10 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 The primary cybersecurity question of 2026 will be whether an
attacker's or defender's AI is more effective. Agentic security will
encourage teams to build products rather than buy them, devalue junior
employees, and lead to workplace upheaval. AI will also improve the
efficacy of common security program weak points, such as secure code
training and asset management.

notifications
