ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HIBP ADDS ALLEGED UNDER ARMOUR DATA BREACH IMPACTING 72 MILLION
EMAILS (4 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Have I Been Pwned added an alleged Under Armour breach attributed to
the Everest ransomware group that exposed 72.7 million unique email
addresses along with names, dates of birth, physical addresses, and
purchase history from a 343GB exfiltration in November. The data was
published after Under Armour reportedly did not pay the ransom, with
the dataset now circulating on underground forums and indexed by
DeHashed. Affected users should monitor for targeted phishing
impersonating order-related communications and change reused
passwords. 

 CISCO FIXES UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS RCE ZERO-DAY EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cisco has announced a new vulnerability impacting United
Communications, Cisco Unity Connection, and Webex Calling Dedicated
Instance. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of
user-supplied input in HTTP requests that could allow an attacker to
obtain access to the underlying system via a sequence of specially
crafted HTTP requests. The patches are version-specific, so admins
should check the README before applying patches. 

 HACKERS EXPLOIT SECURITY TESTING APPS TO BREACH FORTUNE 500 FIRMS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Automated pentest company Pentera discovered nearly 2K instances of
exposed security testing apps, such as OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA,
publicly exposed in the networks of Fortune 500 companies. Many of
these web apps are used for security training and are deployed in
cloud environments with overly permissive IAM roles and default
credentials. Pentera found evidence that 20% of exposed DVWA apps had
malicious artifacts such as webshells and cryptominers deployed.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 IS THAT ALLOWED? AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION IN MODEL CONTEXT
PROTOCOL (13 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Remote MCP servers should implement the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code
grant with PKCE for client authentication, leveraging protected
resource metadata (RFC 9728) and authorization server discovery (RFC
8414) for the handshake. The 2025-11-25 MCP specification introduces
step-up authorization for scope negotiation and recommends Token
Exchange for downstream service authentication, while explicitly
prohibiting token passthrough. Organizations deploying MCP servers
should design granular scopes with clear read/write/delete separation,
ensure short-lived access tokens, and implement proper validation,
including checks for issuer, audience, and expiration. 

 VULNERABILITY PRIORITIZATION BEYOND THE CVSS NUMBER (6 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 CVSS scores alone fail to capture how vulnerabilities propagate
through interconnected systems. Log4Shell is an example in which
widespread nested dependencies, not just technical severity-driven
impact, are at play. The Unified Linkage Model (ULM) framework
evaluates vulnerabilities based on adjacency, inheritance, and trust
relationships to identify "blast radius multipliers," such as SSO
services or CI/CD pipelines. Security teams should map system
dependencies and prioritize patching vulnerabilities near identity
systems and shared services that can amplify downstream risk. 

 KEEPING SECRETS OUT OF LOGS (12 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Secrets often end up in logs from a variety of sources, such as
forgotten debugging lines, excessive error logging, and telemetry.
Some fixes include architecting to reduce logging sinks, using domain
primitives to abstract secrets, using read-once objects, using log
preprocessors, adding unit tests, and implementing taint tracking. To
prepare for a logging overhaul, teams should first lay the foundations
of the initiative, understand the data flow, protect data at choke
points, apply defense-in-depth, and plan for response and recovery in
the event of leaked secrets.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MOST ORGS ARE (STILL) GETTING CLOUD SECURITY WRONG (SPONSOR) [10] 

 59% of AWS IAM users have access keys older than one year, and common
cloud misconfigurations continue to create easy breach paths. On
January 27, Datadog is hosting a live webinar [10] to discuss the
State of Cloud Security, based on security posture data from thousands
of cloud orgs. Join the live discussion + Q&A [10] 

 MITRE LAUNCHES NEW SECURITY FRAMEWORK FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The Embedded Systems Threat Matrix (ESTM) 3.0 is an ATT&CK-inspired
framework that categorizes attack tactics and techniques specific to
hardware and firmware environments. The framework supports cyber
threat modeling and attack path analysis for industries including
energy, robotics, industrial controls, transportation, and healthcare,
and integrates with the EMB3D Threat Model. Security teams protecting
embedded systems should evaluate ESTM to identify vulnerabilities in
their embedded architectures. 

 PATHFINDING.CLOUD (WEB APP) [12] 

 Pathfinding.cloud is a web app from DataDog that collects tools and
guides to detect IAM-based privilege-escalation attacks in AWS. 

 APPCONTROL MANAGER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 AppControl Manager provides a GUI to manage App Control and Code
Integrity on your local or remote devices.

 DON'T TRIP[WIRE] YOURSELF: TESTING ERROR RECOVERY IN ZIG (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Tripwire is a Zig library for injecting failures at named points in
code to test `errdefer` error handling paths, which are typically
untested and a consistent source of resource leaks and memory
corruption. The library uses comptime to completely optimize away in
non-test builds, producing zero runtime cost in production.
Integration into Ghostty immediately uncovered approximately six
`errdefer` bugs that had never manifested in production. 

 VULNCHECK STATE OF EXPLOITATION 2026 (9 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 VulnCheck identified 884 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2025,
with 28.96% exploited on or before CVE publication, up from 23.6% in
2024, highlighting the continued prevalence of zero-day and rapid
n-day exploitation. Network edge devices such as firewalls, VPNs, and
proxies were the most targeted technologies, followed by content
management systems and open source software. Organizations should
prioritize the timely remediation of newly disclosed vulnerabilities
affecting internet-facing infrastructure while maintaining visibility
beyond CISA KEV through additional exploitation intelligence sources. 

 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF BAD CODE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 This post is the first part of a series that applies behavioral
economics to developer processes. Developers want to write secure code
but are often overwhelmed by competing priorities. Security teams
should design technical nudges, shift incentives, and push for
cultural changes to help developers write secure code.
