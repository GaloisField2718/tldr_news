 BEYOND ROI: 5 STEPS TO REPOSITION SECURITY AS A BUSINESS DRIVER
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Everybody knows data breaches can cost millions and negatively impact
your brand. That's why robust security programs and inbound security
reviews are critical to building customer trust. But when lengthy
security processes begin stalling deals and creating internal
friction, leadership starts to question security's ROI.

This guide by SafeBase [4] covers strategies and real customer success
stories for repositioning security as a strategic business enabler
rather than a necessary evil.

Inside, you'll find practical ways to bridge the gap between security
operations and business objectives [4], and how to move towards a more
value-driven approach to cybersecurity.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CYBERCRIMINALS ARRESTED FOR STEALING HUNDREDS OF CONCERT TICKETS
THROUGH STUBHUB EXPLOIT (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Two cybercriminals, Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, were arrested
for stealing hundreds of digital event tickets, including for Taylor
Swift's Eras Tour. They intercepted legitimate StubHub URLs after
purchases and resold about 900 tickets for over $600,000. The pair
face grand larceny charges and potentially 3-15 years in prison. 

 CHATGPT OPERATOR PROMPT INJECTION EXPLOIT LEAKING PRIVATE DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 ChatGPT Operator is an advanced AI agent equipped with web browsing
and reasoning capabilities that can interact with websites on behalf
of users. It is vulnerable to Prompt Injection attacks via
instructions embedded into text or web content that can cause the
model to browse sensitive pages and leak the information to
attacker-controlled websites. OpenAI has implemented defenses such as
prompting the user for confirmation, but researchers have shown that
these mitigations can be bypassed. 

 MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAN SPOOF PASSWORD MANAGERS IN NEW ATTACK
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at SquareX Labs developed a new “polymorphic” attack
allowing malicious Chrome extensions to steal sensitive data. Once a
user is tricked into installing the extension, it scans for password
managers, impersonates them, and prompts users to reauthenticate,
sending the information to attackers. SquareX Labs has urged Google to
restrict extensions' ability to alter their appearance or behavior,
but no mitigations currently exist for this attack.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ZEN AND THE ART OF MICROCODE HACKING (13 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post details the concepts and tools behind EntrySign, the AMD
Zen microcode signature validation vulnerability disclosed last month.
It delves into microcode fundamentals, AMD's anti-tampering measures,
and the specific vulnerability involving the CMAC hash function. It
also announces the release of the Zentool suite, which consists of
tools for microcode patch examination, including limited disassembly,
microcode patch authoring using a limited amount of reverse-engineered
assembly, microcode patch signing, and microcode patch loading. 

 FOUR WAYS TO GRANT CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS IN AWS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Grant access to a specific IAM role using the Principal element of
the resource-based policy, an AWS account using the Principal element,
a particular IAM role in an account using the AWS:PrincipalArn
condition, and an entire AWS organization using the AWS:PrincipalOrgId
condition. This post includes an example scenario with an S3 bucket
and discusses tradeoffs associated with each method. 

 AUTO-COLOR: AN EMERGING AND EVASIVE LINUX BACKDOOR (11 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Palo Alto's Unit 42 is monitoring a new malware known as Auto-Color.
Upon startup, if the malware is not named Auto-Color, it will try to
install a malware implant that imitates libcext.so. It also copies
itself to /var/log/cross/auto-color and adds this library to
ld.preload. Besides its command and control capabilities, the harmful
library implant uses custom encryption and strives to conceal network
communications by hooking into libc's open function.
