ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ESCAN CONFIRMS UPDATE SERVER BREACHED TO PUSH MALICIOUS UPDATE (3
MINUTE READ) [4] 

 MicroWorld Technologies confirmed unauthorized access to a regional
eScan antivirus update server resulted in malicious updates
distributed to customers during a two-hour window on January 20,
deploying a modified "Reload.exe" file signed with what appears to be
eScan's certificate. An analysis revealed the malware enabled
persistence through scheduled tasks named "CorelDefrag", modified
Windows HOSTS files to prevent legitimate updates, and connected to
multiple C2 servers to download CONSCTLX.exe backdoor as the final
payload. eScan isolated the compromised infrastructure within hours,
rotated credentials, and released a remediation update for affected
customers, though the company disputed claims about the discovery
timeline and customer notification efforts. 

 THOUSANDS MORE OREGON RESIDENTS LEARN THEIR HEALTH DATA WAS STOLEN IN
TRIZETTO BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A 2024 cyberattack on TriZetto Provider Solutions exposed protected
health information and personal data for more than 700,000 patients
across multiple US states, and the breach was not detected until
nearly a year later. Oregon clinics are now notifying thousands of
affected patients, while the owner, Cognizant, faces multiple class
action lawsuits despite claiming the threat was swiftly contained and
that no ransom was involved. 

 FAKE CLAWDBOT VS CODE EXTENSION INSTALLS SCREENCONNECT RAT (18 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Aikido Security discovered a trojanized "ClawdBot Agent" VS Code
extension impersonating the viral AI assistant Clawdbot, which deploys
weaponized ConnectWise ScreenConnect software (Code.exe) configured to
connect to attacker infrastructure. Microsoft quickly removed the
extension after disclosure. The malware features a sophisticated
multi-layered payload delivery. The attack demonstrates advanced
evasion through functional AI features to avoid suspicion, process
camouflage using legitimate VS Code executable names, DLL sideloading
with anti-analysis timing checks, and quadruple impersonation layers
that successfully weaponize trusted remote administration software.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI FOUND 12 OF 12 OPENSSL ZERO-DAYS (WHILE CURL CANCELLED ITS BUG
BOUNTY) (15 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 AISLE's AI system discovered all 12 zero-day vulnerabilities in
OpenSSL's January 2026 security release, marking the first real-world
demonstration of AI-based vulnerability discovery at industrial scale.
The findings span multiple subsystems and include vulnerabilities that
remained undetected for up to 27 years, bringing AISLE's total to 13
of 14 CVE-2025-* vulnerabilities discovered in OpenSSL plus 5 genuine
CVEs in curl. This achievement contrasts sharply with curl's
cancellation of its bug bounty program due to overwhelming
AI-generated spam, illustrating how AI simultaneously collapses median
submission quality while raising the ceiling for sophisticated
vulnerability discovery in critical infrastructure. 

 UNDERSTANDING THE RUSSIAN CYBER THREAT TO THE 2026 WINTER OLYMPICS (6
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Russia's exclusion from the 2026 Winter Olympics removes critical
geopolitical deterrents. The threat model has shifted from espionage
to disruption, with potential attacks including destructive malware
targeting operational technology, exploitation of Smart Road SS51
Alemagna's V2X infrastructure to hijack Variable Message Signs, and
AI-amplified hybrid attacks combining cyber disruptions with
high-fidelity deepfakes to transform technical outages into public
safety crises. Defenders should prioritize zero-trust visibility with
anomaly detection for IoT devices, implement micro-segmentation to
prevent lateral movement from compromised edge devices, and deploy
content provenance measures to verify legitimate communications
against AI-generated content. 

 A BRIEF DEEP DIVE INTO ATTACKING AND DEFENDING KUBERNETES (10 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Kubernetes vulnerabilities can be divided into four key categories:
pod weaknesses, identity and access mechanisms, cluster configuration
components, and control plane entry points. This post provides a deep
dive into several specific attack areas, including overly permissive
RBAC, service account token abuse, malicious admissions controllers,
writable volume mounts, unauthorized access to ETCD, and Kubernetes
golden tickets. Each section includes an explanation of the attack
vector, possible defenses, and a Falco rule to detect the attack.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 AISY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [10] 

 Aisy provides an AI-assisted vulnerability management platform that
maps infrastructure like an attacker, ingests tickets from existing
tools, and surfaces chained, high-impact vulnerabilities so security
teams can prioritize and remediate the most critical risks first. 

 SECOBSERVE (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 SecObserve is an open source vulnerability management system for
software development teams that supports a variety of open source
vulnerability scanners. It integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines. 

 SYSMONCONFIGPUSHER V2 (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SysmonConfigPusher v2 is a web-based tool for managing Sysmon
configurations across Windows endpoints using agentless or agent-based
deployment.

 UNDRESSED VICTIMS FILE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST XAI FOR GROK
DEEPFAKES (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 At least 100 victims filed a class action lawsuit against xAI,
alleging that Grok generated 4.4 million images over nine days,
including at least 1.8 million non-consensual sexualized deepfakes of
women, men, and children, posted publicly on X. The lawsuit claims
that xAI executives knowingly failed to implement industry-standard
safeguards and instead encouraged users to create "nudified" content
through features such as tagging handles to manipulate photos and a
"spicy" option for generating controversial content. The case adds to
mounting legal pressure on xAI and Musk: 35 State Attorneys General
have expressed "deep concern," and formal investigations have been
opened by the EU, UK, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, while US
federal agencies remain silent. 

 U.S. CONVICTS EX-GOOGLE ENGINEER FOR SENDING AI TECH DATA TO CHINA (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Former Google software engineer Linwei Ding was convicted on seven
counts of economic espionage and seven counts of trade secret theft
for stealing over 2,000 pages of confidential AI materials between May
2022 and April 2023, including Google's AI supercomputing
infrastructure, proprietary TPU/GPU systems, orchestration software,
and SmartNIC networking technology. Ding is secretly affiliated with
two China-based technology companies. He had a colleague scan his
badge to falsely indicate his presence while traveling to China. The
case highlights insider threat risks, as Ding stated his goal was to
help China achieve computing infrastructure capabilities on par with
international levels. Each conviction carries a maximum sentence of
10-15 years. 

 OPENCLAW AI RUNS WILD IN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 OpenClaw, a widely popular open-source AI agent, is rapidly gaining
adoption across enterprises, integrating with email, messaging, and
system tools, creating powerful non-human identities with broad
access. Experts warn that its “vibe-coded” development, supply
chain exposure, and susceptibility to prompt injection form a
“lethal trifecta” of risk.
