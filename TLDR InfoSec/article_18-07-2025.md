Convincing AI-based impersonation seemed like science fiction a few
short years ago. Now it's rampant and causing major damage to
organizations.

That's why Beyond Identity built RealityCheck—to eliminate AI
impersonation attacks. Watch this 15 minute demo [4] to see:

 	* Why detection tools fall short, and what real prevention looks
like
 	* A deepfake impersonation attempt, and how RealityCheck blocks it
in real time

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 WATCH OUT, ANOTHER MAX-SEVERITY, MAKE-ME-ROOT CISCO BUG ON THE LOOSE
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cisco patched a critical 10/10 severity bug (CVE-2025-20337) in its
Identity Services Engine. The bug allowed unauthenticated remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Due to
insufficient input validation, the vulnerability affects ISE releases
3.3 and 3.4. No workarounds exist. Immediate patching is essential, as
exploits are expected soon. 

 UAP CONFIRMS RANSOMWARE ATTACK, PERSONAL DATA AND EMAIL
CORRESPONDENCE EXPOSED (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP) posted a notice on its
website that it suffered a data breach due to a ransomware attack. The
party has stated that any individual who has interacted with the party
may have had their data exposed, but it cannot conclusively determine
which individuals were affected or what data was stolen. The stolen
data may include email addresses, phone numbers, identity records,
banking records, employment history, and any emails or attachments
sent to or received from the party. 

 NEW TELEMESSAGE SGNL FLAW IS ACTIVELY BEING EXPLOITED BY ATTACKERS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 TeleMessage SGNL, a Signal clone used by US government agencies, has
an exposed /heapdump endpoint (CVE-2025-48927) that dumps 150MB memory
snapshots containing usernames, passwords, and session data with no
authentication required. Attackers are actively exploiting this flaw -
CISA added it to the KEV catalog on July 14 and mandated federal
agencies patch or stop using the software by July 22. Over 11 IPs have
directly targeted this vulnerability, while 2,000+ IPs have scanned
Spring Boot Actuator endpoints in the past 90 days, indicating
widespread reconnaissance activity.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE LINUXSYS CRYPTOMINER (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post dives into Linuxsys, a cryptominer exploiting
CVE-2021-41773 in a long-running campaign since 2021. Attackers use
compromised legitimate websites for stealthy malware distribution and
evasion, and the vulnerability remains actively exploited with dozens
of daily attempts. 

 WHY IS PREVENTATIVE SECURITY SO DIFFICULT? (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security teams should shift from endless vulnerability scanning and
detection to preventative tools that stop issues at the source, like
using supply chain security tools instead of just identifying
vulnerabilities after deployment. Most security vendors focus on data
collection and pattern detection rather than systemic prevention,
leaving organizations to fix the identified problems manually. The
strategy requires getting engineering teams to adopt preventative
controls early in development workflows, rather than overwhelming them
with vulnerability reports and SLAs that force reactive responses. 

 AUTOMATED FUNCTION ID DATABASE GENERATION IN GHIDRA ON WINDOWS (3
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post demonstrates how to automate function identification in
stripped Windows binaries using Ghidra's Function ID databases, which
work similarly to IDA Pro's FLIRT signatures to match known library
functions against decompiled code. The approach involves extracting
object files from static libraries (.lib files), importing them into
Ghidra projects, and generating function signature databases that
automatically rename generic function labels with actual library
function names like OpenSSL functions. This technique significantly
accelerates reverse engineering by eliminating manual function
analysis, allowing security researchers to focus on vulnerability
discovery rather than spending time identifying what each function
does.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DOTENVX (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Powered up dotenv that reduces the blast radius of secrets by
splitting secrets management into two distinct components: an
encrypted secrets file and a separate decryption key. 

 ICOUNTER (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 The iCOUNTER platform can act as an early warning system that
identifies threats specific to the customer and its ecosystem, while
also providing intelligence that enables rapid containment and
recovery after an attack has taken place. 

 LINWINPWN (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 linWinPwn is a bash script that wraps a collection of Active
Directory tools for enumeration, vulnerability checks, object
modifications, and password dumping.

 GOOGLE FINDS CUSTOM BACKDOOR BEING INSTALLED ON SONICWALL NETWORK
DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Hackers (UNC6148) are compromising end-of-life SonicWall Secure
Mobile Access appliances using leaked administrator credentials. The
attackers install "Overstep" backdoor malware that deletes log
entries, hindering forensic investigation, which means the attack
method and vulnerabilities exploited remain unknown. 

 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND $1B ON OFFENSIVE HACKING OPERATIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 As part of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, $1B has been allocated for
offensive hacking operations. These funds can be used for carrying out
attacks using 0-days and installing spyware, but also for everyday
expenses such as infrastructure and intelligence gathering. Critics
note that the bill slashes funding from defensive operations such as
the CISA, potentially leaving the U.S. unable to defend itself.

 Operation Eastwood, a coordinated international law enforcement
effort led by Europol, shut down over 100 servers belonging to the
Russian pro-Putin DDoS group NoName057(16), arrested two individuals,
and issued seven international arrest warrants targeting the group's
4,000+ members who conducted politically motivated attacks against
Ukrainian and NATO-supporting websites.
