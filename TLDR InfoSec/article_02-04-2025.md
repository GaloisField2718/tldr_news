ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 1,500 POSTGRESQL SERVERS COMPROMISED IN FILELESS CRYPTOCURRENCY
MINING CAMPAIGN (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Exposed PostgreSQL instances are the target of an ongoing campaign
designed to gain unauthorized access and deploy cryptocurrency miners.
It utilizes the COPY... FROM PROGRAM SQL command to execute arbitrary
shell commands on the host and also deploys an obfuscated Golang
binary codenamed postmaster that mimics the legitimate PostgreSQL
multi-user database server. 

 CHECK POINT CONFIRMS BREACH BUT SAYS IT WAS OLD DATA (3 MINUTE READ)
[7] 

 A hacker going by the name CoreInjection claimed to have stolen a
highly sensitive dataset from Check Point containing internal network
maps and architectural diagrams, user credentials, employee connect
information, and proprietary source code. Check Point responded to
these allegations by saying that this was an old, known security event
with a limited scope that did not impact any customer data. Hudson
Rock co-founder Alon Gal expressed skepticism of both claims and
stated that the screenshots the hacker posted likely indicated a
severity between the two claims. 

 HACKERS ABUSE WORDPRESS MU-PLUGINS TO HIDE MALICIOUS CODE (2 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Must-Use Plugins (mu-plugins) are special plugins for WordPress sites
that automatically execute on every page load and do not appear in the
default view on the admin panel. Researchers at Sucuri have observed
threat actors abusing mu-plugins for persistence. Sucuri has observed
three commonly used payloads: one that redirects users to a malicious
browser update site, one that installs a webshell, and one that
replaces images with explicit content.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THREAT MODELLING AND ANALYZING IPHONE MIRRORING (13 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Aaron Schlitt found security flaws in Apple's iPhone Mirroring
feature, such as bypassing camera and microphone restrictions via
shortcuts and accessing wallet data through NFC, which he notified
Apple about. While Apple added some security measures through the
Secure Enclave, the feature created new attack vectors and exhibited
inconsistent security, especially with locked apps and Stolen Device
Protection. Apple's responses varied; some reports were initially
dismissed as "expected behavior" but later addressed in updates,
indicating an unclear threat model for iPhone Mirroring within the
company. 

 RUST FOR MALWARE DEVELOPMENT (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 A Bishop Fox researcher examines how Rust outperforms C/C++ in
malware development. The analysis reveals that Rust-based malware
results in larger binaries that resist reverse engineering, evade
signature detection, and complicate tools like Ghidra. The author
illustrates this with a dropper that enumerates processes, injects
shellcode via file mapping, and stages a C2 payload, ultimately
asserting that Rust effectively simulates modern adversarial tactics. 

 THE SECURITY RESEARCH PRODUCT FUNCTION (8 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Zack Allen discusses the place and responsibilities of a Security
Research team in security products. In security products, the security
research organization can be thought of as the CTO of a product line
in that the business needs engineering to inform product decisions,
designers to communicate complex security topics to end-users, and
work with marketing to maintain the veracity of materials. Allen also
shows how the Kano model of product development can be applied to
demonstrate the must have features, satisfied features such as updated
rules, and wow features such as being the first to discover a new
threat actor.

 DPRK IT WORKERS EXPANDING IN SCOPE AND SCALE (5 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 DPRK IT workers have expanded operations globally, especially in
Europe, by masquerading as legitimate remote workers to infiltrate
companies and generate revenue for North Korea. They employ deceptive
tactics such as fake personas, falsified credentials from institutions
like Belgrade University, and blockchain projects in the UK, using
facilitators in the US and UK to bypass identity verification. Since
October 2024, they have increased extortion attempts against former
employers, threatening to release sensitive data post-termination, and
have started targeting virtualized BYOD environments where traditional
security monitoring is harder. 

 WHOIS HAS BEEN REPLACED BY RDAP: HOW DO THE TWO SYSTEMS COMPARE? (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 ICANN officially abandoned the WHOIS service on January 28. To
replace it, ICANN released the Registration Data Access Protocol
(RDAP) to provide users with access to gTLD registration data. RDAP
has numerous advantages over WHOIS including support for access
controls on the data that a user can see, JSON support, and HTTPS
support. 

 WHY I RECOMMEND AGAINST BRAVE (12 MINUTE READ) [18]
