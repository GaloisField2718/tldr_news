 WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT 2025 CYBER THREATS FROM ANALYZING 3.6 PETABYTES
OF WEB DATA (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Flashpoint's Threat Intelligence Report looks at +3.6 petabytes of
data from the hardest-to-reach corners of the web — revealing 2.1B
stolen credentials and 5,742 ransomware attacks in 2024, with five
major RaaS groups responsible for nearly half.

 	* Current threats — from infostealers to the growing impact of
geopolitical tensions
 	* Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) [4] used by today's
most prolific threat actors, including ransomware-as-a-service groups
and malware developers.
 	* How to reduce critical patching workloads by 83% and focus on the
real threats.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CVE, GLOBAL SOURCE OF CYBERSECURITY INFO, WAS HOURS FROM BEING CUT BY
DHS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) repository, a
25-year-old program run by MITRE for DHS, serves as the global
cybersecurity standard for identifying and documenting security
vulnerabilities. Yesterday, there were rumors that MITRE's contract
would expire, but it has received an 11-month extension from CISA,
averting potential widespread disruption to vulnerability management
worldwide. 

 APPLE FIXES TWO ZERO-DAYS EXPLOITED IN TARGETED IPHONE ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has released emergency security updates to patch two new
zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in sophisticated attacks against
iPhones. The first vulnerability is a flaw in CoreAudio, which can be
exploited by processing an audio stream in a malicious file to execute
remote code. The second vulnerability is a flawed RPAC that allows
attackers with read or write access to bypass Pointer Authentication,
which is a security feature to protect against memory vulnerabilities.


 HUGE RANSOMWARE CAMPAIGN TARGETS AWS S3 STORAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Security researchers have discovered a publicly accessible server
containing 1,229 unique AWS credentials. Upon investigation, the
researchers found that the active keys were used in S3 ransomware
campaigns, where the attackers utilized SSE-C to encrypt S3 bucket
data and demanded 0.3 BTC (~$25,000) per victim. In some cases, the
highly automated attackers were willing to offer a “proof of
decryption” test file restoration.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EDV - ENDPOINT DETECTION & VIBES (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 EDV is a tool that feeds Windows Sysmon security events to
Microsoft's Copilot AI through WebSocket connections, asking it to
identify malicious activity. Testing with known attack techniques
showed Copilot could detect about 40% of malicious events not blocked
by Windows Defender, though with inconsistent results and false
positives. 

 ACCESS DENIED? NOT ALWAYS! HUNTING IDORS AND ACCESS CONTROL FLAWS (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 IDOR vulnerabilities occur when attackers manipulate direct object
references like IDs in URLs to access unauthorized data. As a common
form of Broken Access Control, these flaws are prevalent in web
applications, relatively easy to find, and highly impactful. This
guide walks through how bug bounty hunters regularly exploit it. 

 DETECTING C2-JITTERED BEACONS WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS (7 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Frequency analysis is a technique that allows for the detection of
anomalies in a set of data. This post details how Fourier Transforms
can be used to shift data to the frequency domain and then detect C2
beaconing behavior. When a C2 beacon utilizes jitter to vary its
periodicity, a sliding window must be used to properly detect the
activity.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SYMBIOTIC BRINGS AI DETECTION, REMEDIATION, AND EDUCATION DIRECTLY
INTO THE IDE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Developers are moving fast - your security should too. Symbiotic
Security v1 [11] helps you ship secure code without slowing down. With
AI-powered remediation, real-time contextual training, and an AI chat
assistant built into your IDE, security works with developers to
accelerate their flow. Teams can save an estimated $750+ per
developer, per month. Speed and security, finally aligned. Get
started. [11] 

 AURASCAPE (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Aurascape helps corporate IT departments monitor AI employee usage
across thousands of AI applications—both approved and unauthorized.
The technology tracks interactions, decodes prompt-response data, and
evaluates security risks, even for less common AI tools. 

 CONTENT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Security automation content in SCAP, Bash, Ansible, and other formats


 OLLVM-UNFLATTENER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 ollvm-unflattener is a Python tool to deobfuscate control flow
flattening applied by OLLVM.

 GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN RANSOMWARE FIENDS FIND 'INSURANCE' 'POLICY'
IN YOUR FILES (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Companies with cyber insurance face ransomware demands 2.8 times
higher than uninsured victims, as criminals specifically search for
insurance policies during attacks. Insured victims pay more often (44%
vs 24%) and pay significantly larger amounts. 

 SECURITY OPERATIONS WITH RUNREVEAL'S MCP SERVER (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 SIEM provider RunReveal released an MCP server for use with its
product. In this post, RunReveal provides insights into some ways that
its customers are using the MCP server for threat hunting with Cursor,
investigating GuardDuty alerts, and tuning and testing alerts.
RunReveal believes that enriching and standardizing data to make it
easier for LLMs to query is the future of its product. 

 THE WINDOWS REGISTRY ADVENTURE #6: KERNEL-MODE OBJECTS (66 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 This blog post focuses on kernel-mode registry objects essential for
runtime hive management. It meticulously examines key internal
structures, including _CMHIVE, _HHIVE, memory mapping mechanisms, cell
maps, and key control blocks that collectively enable registry
functionality like transaction management and synchronization. The
post provides detailed explanations of these previously undocumented
structures based on reverse engineering of Windows Server 2019, noting
these findings apply to Windows 11 as well.
