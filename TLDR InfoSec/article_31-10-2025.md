 WEBINAR: HOW REDDIT MATURED ACCESS MANAGEMENT WITH 1PASSWORD
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Poorly-managed passwords are the #1 cause of breaches, and they leave
IT teams struggling with fragmented access management and manual
onboarding/offboarding processes. Reddit was dealing with all these
challenges, plus a compromised security vendor. They needed a solution
that reduced credential risk without slowing down their employees.

In this webinar [4], Reddit's Sr. Manager of Enterprise Security &
Systems, Nick Fohs, shares the inside story of how his team used
1Password to manage credentials across the entire company. You'll get
a first-hand look at the problems they faced, and the impact 1Password
has had on security and efficiency.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW TEE.FAIL SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACK EXTRACTS SECRETS FROM INTEL AND AMD
DDR5 SECURE ENCLAVES (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 TEE.Fail is a side-channel attack that targets DDR5 memory systems
which uses a $1,000 interposition device to physically monitor memory
traffic and extract cryptographic keys from Intel TDX/SGX and AMD
SEV-SNP trusted execution environments. The attack exploits weaknesses
in AES-XTS deterministic encryption used by both vendors, enabling
attackers to record memory operations between CPU and DRAM, extract
ECDSA attestation keys, and compromise confidential virtual machines
by faking attestation processes. Both Intel and AMD have classified
this as an out-of-scope physical attack with no planned mitigations,
leaving software countermeasures as the only defense option despite
their high implementation costs. 

 MAJOR US TELECOM BACKBONE FIRM HACKED BY NATION-STATE ACTORS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Ribbon Communications has suffered a breach with attackers accessing
the IT network from December 2024. No sensitive data exfiltration has
been confirmed. Some customer files outside the main network were
accessed, but notifications have been sent. The company does not
anticipate a major operational or financial impact. 

 CONDUENT ADMITS ITS DATA BREACH MAY HAVE AFFECTED AROUND 10 MILLION
PEOPLE (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Conduent has confirmed a cyberattack exposed sensitive data of up to
10 million people. The breach, attributed to the SafePay ransomware
gang, lasted nearly three months and compromised data such as Social
Security numbers and medical information. Impacted individuals are
spread across several states.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BATTLING SHADOW AI: PROMPT INJECTION FOR THE GOOD (10 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 Researchers developed a defensive use of prompt injection to combat
Shadow AI risks by embedding hidden warnings in corporate documents
that trigger alerts when users upload sensitive files to unapproved AI
tools like ChatGPT or DeepSeek, successfully displaying disclaimers
and, in some cases, blocking processing entirely. The team built an
open-source prototype tool called "Prompt Injection for the Good" to
test effectiveness across multiple LLMs and file types, finding most
models honor carefully-phrased warnings in .docx, .pdf, and .eml
formats. It failed to detect prompts in heavily obfuscated text and
OCR-based tools. Security professionals should experiment with
embedding defensive prompt injections in corporate document templates
and sensitivity labels as a user awareness mechanism for Shadow AI.
This creative approach has limitations, including inconsistent LLM
behavior, potential conflicts with vendor anti-injection defenses, and
the dual-use risk of the technique itself. 

 ENHANCE EMAIL SECURITY USING VPC ENDPOINTS WITH AMAZON SES (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Amazon offers the ability to use VPC endpoints for isolating network
traffic and securing Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) SMTP
connections. This walkthrough from AWS details the process for
creating a secure SMTP configuration using VPC endpoints, security
groups to limit SMTP traffic to approved networks, and IAM policies to
limit SES usage to authorized accounts. 

 10 NPM TYPOSQUATTED PACKAGES DEPLOY MULTI-STAGE CREDENTIAL HARVESTER
(1 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Socket has identified a campaign using 10 typosquatted npm packages
that execute credential-stealing malware when installed. These
packages exploit the npm postinstall lifecycle to run code
automatically, showing a fake CAPTCHA and realistic installation
prompts to deceive developers. The payload employs multiple layers of
obfuscation, fingerprints victims by IP, and downloads a 24MB
cross-platform information stealer that harvests credentials from
system keyrings, browsers, and authentication services on Windows,
Linux, and macOS.

 BRIDA 0.6 RELEASED! (1 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Brida 0.6 now supports Frida 17+ after breaking changes in Frida
removed runtime bridges from GumJS, which affected many tools,
including earlier Brida versions. The update features major JavaScript
refactoring for Frida 17.3.2+ compatibility, support for frida-compile
19.0.4, new Host:Port and DeviceId modes, OkHttp hostname verifier
bypass, improved Android root detection, and Gradle configuration.
Mobile security testers should upgrade to Brida 0.6 for current Frida
support. 0.6pre remains for legacy use with older Frida versions on
incompatible devices. It's pending approval in Burp Suite's BApp Store
but available on GitHub.

 THE RISE OF COLLABORATIVE TACTICS AMONG CHINA-ALIGNED CYBER ESPIONAGE
CAMPAIGNS (13 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Trend Micro researchers identified a sophisticated "Premier
Pass-as-a-Service" model where China-aligned APT groups Earth Estries
and Earth Naga collaborate by sharing access to compromised networks,
with Earth Estries acting as an access broker that hands off
already-compromised systems to Earth Naga for continued exploitation.
The attacks targeted government agencies and telecommunications
providers across APAC, Southeast Asia, and NATO countries using
multiple deployment vectors, including CrowDoor backdoors, ShadowPad
malware, and Cobalt Strike beacons delivered through DLL side-loading
and compromised credentials. This emerging collaboration pattern
complicates attribution efforts and represents an evolution beyond
traditional initial access brokers, as threat actors share access at
later stages of the kill chain (command-and-control phase) rather than
just initial entry points, requiring defenders to move beyond process
chain analysis and monitor for suspicious file deployments and
unauthorized remote administration tools. 

 SECURITY RISKS OF LLM FRAMEWORKS WITH CASE STUDIES (13 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Critical vulnerabilities across major LLM frameworks like SSRF, path
traversal, SQL injection, RCE, server-side template injection, and DoS
attacks arise from insufficient input validation, unsafe code
execution features, and flawed integration with external resources.
They stem from common implementation mistakes, including failing to
validate URLs and paths in web crawlers, executing LLM-generated SQL
without proper sanitization, failing to enforce import restrictions in
code execution environments, and setting inadequate resource limits
for streaming operations. Developers should avoid
experimental/deprecated framework features, implement strict input
validation using allowlists for URLs and paths, separate templates
from user data, restrict LLM permissions to the minimum necessary
levels, and apply multi-layered defenses. 

 CVE-2025-62725: FROM "DOCKER COMPOSE PS" TO SYSTEM COMPROMISE (3
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A path traversal vulnerability in Docker Compose allowed attackers to
write arbitrary files on host systems by crafting malicious OCI
artifacts. The bug was triggered by seemingly harmless commands like
'docker compose ps', enabling attackers to escape the cache directory
and gain SSH access by injecting public keys into authorized_keys
files. Docker patched this high-severity flaw (CVSS 8.9) in version
v2.40.2.
