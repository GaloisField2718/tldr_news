TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2026-02-18

 YOUR BREACH STARTED IN AWS. SPREAD TO AZURE. EXFILTRATED FROM
GCP AND HEADED TO YOUR PRIVATE DATA CENTER. AND YOU'RE STILL
LOGGING INTO 3 CONSOLES (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers don't respect cloud boundaries — they pivot across
your AWS, Azure, and GCP environments in minutes. THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR SECURITY TOOLS ARE STILL SILOED BY CLOUD PROVIDERS. 

Illumio Insights [4] shows the complete attack path across all your
clouds: 

 	* One map for everything. See cross-cloud lateral movement in
real-time, not pieced together days later. 
 	* Detect when dev in AWS talks to prod in Azure over unauthorized
protocols. 
 	* Find the servers you didn't know existed (such
as acquisitions, shadow IT, forgotten test environments). 
 	* Stop multi-cloud attacks at the first hop and quarantine before
they pivot on to another cloud environment. 

Your SOC stops hunting across consoles. And your attackers stop
getting multiple chances to succeed.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HOW I "HACKED" CHATGPT ATLAS... AND WHY IT WASN'T PATCHED (6 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 A researcher discovered that ChatGPT Atlas's OWL architecture allows
local attackers to replace the headless Chromium "OWL Host" with a
malicious app, inheriting Atlas's macOS TCC privileges to silently
access the microphone, camera, or other permissions previously granted
by the user. OpenAI declined to patch the bug, citing Chrome's threat
model, which excludes local attacks—a stance inherited downstream by
Electron and Chromium forks that the researcher argues leaves macOS
users fundamentally less secure. The unpatched vulnerability
highlights a growing tension between Chrome's threat-model assumptions
and macOS's TCC permission system, in which confused deputy attacks
can bypass OS-level consent controls without user awareness. 

 INDIAN PHARMACY CHAIN GIANT EXPOSED CUSTOMER DATA AND INTERNAL
SYSTEMS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A misconfigured “super admin” interface at DavaIndia Pharmacy,
part of Zota Healthcare, allowed anyone to create high-privilege
accounts and access data on nearly 17,000 online orders across 883
stores, including names, contacts, addresses, and purchased medicines.
Attackers could have altered pricing, discounts, and prescription
requirements before the flaw, reported to CERT-In in August 2025, was
quietly fixed. 

 HOW A SINGLE TYPO LED TO RCE IN FIREFOX (11 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A single-character typo (using `&` instead of `|`) in a SpiderMonkey
Wasm GC array refactoring commit introduced a use-after-free
vulnerability in Firefox's renderer process, enabling arbitrary
read/write primitives and full code execution. The bug caused
out-of-line array forwarding pointers to be incorrectly zeroed during
garbage collection, allowing attackers to reclaim freed memory via
heap spraying, bypass ASLR through pointer leaks, and hijack control
flow. The vulnerability affected only Firefox 149 Nightly and was
patched within six days of the report. No release versions were
affected.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 INSIDE BASHE: THE INTERVIEW WITH THE RANSOMWARE GROUP KNOWN AS APT73
(8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Bashe (formerly APT73) is a RaaS group rebranded around a Chinese
mythological serpent identity. It operates with a 0.25 BTC affiliate
entry fee as both a monetization and anti-infiltration measure, and
collaborates with initial access brokers and disgruntled corporate
insiders. The group claims full-stack encryption, EDR bypass
capabilities, and centralized control over negotiation panels and data
publication timers, while excluding healthcare, schools, and CIS
countries from targeting. This pattern is consistent with norms in the
Russian-speaking ransomware ecosystem. Their deliberate vagueness on
technical specifics such as key management architecture, combined with
profit-first rhetoric and a shifting geographic focus toward countries
with higher payment rates, provides useful threat intelligence for
defenders modeling RaaS operator behavior. 

 BREAKING EBPF SECURITY: HOW KERNEL ROOTKITS BLIND OBSERVABILITY TOOLS
(16 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Research has shown that kernel rootkits can systematically blind
eBPF-based security tools by using ftrace to hook the data-delivery
plumbing, BPF iterators, ring buffers, perf events, and map
operations, rather than targeting the eBPF programs themselves. The
Singularity rootkit selectively filters hidden processes and network
connections at the kernel-to-userspace boundary, causing security
tools to operate on a fabricated view of system state while believing
they have complete visibility. The findings underscore that eBPF
observability assumes a trusted kernel, and defenders must prioritize
preventing kernel compromise through Secure Boot, signed module
enforcement, and layered out-of-host detection rather than relying
solely on kernel-level telemetry. 

 A STANDARDIZATION GUIDE TO PROMPT INJECTION (11 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Lasso proposes a structured taxonomy for prompt injection,
distinguishing between attacker intent (system prompt leakage vs.
jailbreak) and text-based techniques, including instruction override,
role-playing, and others. Each category includes concrete subtypes and
examples to help practitioners more reliably detect, reason about, and
defend against modern LLM prompt attacks.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 🧘‍♀️ PEACE OF MIND IN EVERY SPRINT (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Writing code can be stressful—but not half as stressful as a
surprise security meltdown. Inject optimism and calm into the
developer scrum with Microsoft Azure [12]. Unified security across
code and cloud environments and built-in DDoS protection mean you've
got less cause for concern—and a clear mind for innovation. Help
secure your apps with Azure > [12] 

 LAZYDLLSIDELOAD (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 LazyDLLSideload is a Rust-based tool for generating DLL proxy and
sideload projects for red team engagements, automatically parsing PE
export tables and producing ready-to-compile implants with payload
embedding, string obfuscation, and dynamic invocation via dyncvoke. It
supports two modes: sideload (pure DLL replacement with stub exports)
and proxy (forwarding calls to the renamed original DLL while
intercepting a specified function), with optional native syscall
execution via NtCreateThreadEx for improved OPSEC. 

 PWNHUB (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Hand‑curated offensive security toolkit, scripts, and writeups for
ethical hackers, pentesters, and IT pros eager to level up. 

 VULNCHECK (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [15] 

 VulnCheck provides a vulnerability intelligence platform that tracks
vulnerability lifecycles and active exploitation, monitoring exploit
code and payloads so security teams can identify, prioritize, and
patch the CVEs that pose the most immediate, real-world risk.

 SECURING DIGITAL ASSETS IN AN EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE: THE
FIREBLOCKS DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH APPROACH TO SECURITY (29 MINUTE READ) [16]


 Fireblocks published a comprehensive whitepaper detailing the
blockchain threat landscape, where over $17 billion in cryptocurrency
has been stolen since 2020, with DPRK-linked actors accounting for
approximately $6.75 billion and three-quarters of all attacks on
crypto platforms. The paper outlines a defense-in-depth architecture
combining zero-trust infrastructure, MPC-based distributed key
management, multi-device transaction approval, and real-time DeFi
threat detection to mitigate attack vectors, including spear phishing,
API compromise, blind signing, and address poisoning. Security teams
managing digital assets should evaluate their own controls against the
included readiness assessment, particularly ensuring no single
compromised component — whether an endpoint, admin account, or cloud
environment — can enable unauthorized fund movement. 

 HACKERS OFFER TO SELL MILLIONS OF EURAIL USER RECORDS (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Hackers claim to have stolen 1.3 TB of data from Eurail's AWS S3,
Zendesk, and GitLab, including source code, support tickets, and
database backups with personal data on potentially millions of Eurail
and Interrail customers. Exposed fields range from contact and
passport details to health and bank data for DiscoverEU travelers. 

 INFOSTEALER STEALS OPENCLAW AI AGENT CONFIGURATION FILES AND GATEWAY
TOKENS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 An infostealer, likely a Vidar variant, exfiltrated OpenClaw config
files containing gateway tokens, device keys, and an AI agent
“soul,” enabling remote access and identity hijacking. Meanwhile,
malicious ClawHub skills, exposed OpenClaw instances with RCE
potential, and persistent Moltbook accounts are growing attacker
interest as OpenClaw's ecosystem rapidly scales.

contesting the ruling as procedurally invalid since neither was
notified or given the opportunity to defend themselves.
