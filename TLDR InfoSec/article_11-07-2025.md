ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ATOMIC MACOS INFOSTEALER ADDS BACKDOOR FOR PERSISTENT ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Malware analysts discovered a new version of the Atomic macOS (AMOS)
infostealer, which includes a backdoor that offers attackers
persistent access to compromised systems. The new version of the
malware features an embedded backdoor, utilizes LackDaemons to survive
reboots, implements ID-based victim tracking, and introduces new C2
infrastructure. The embedded backdoor allows threat actors to execute
commands remotely, log keystrokes, introduce additional payloads, or
probe for lateral movement opportunities. 

 MILLIONS OF CARS EXPOSED TO REMOTE HACKING VIA PERFEKTBLUE ATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 PCA Cyber Security discovered critical vulnerabilities in
OpenSynergy's BlueSDK Bluetooth framework affecting millions of cars
from Mercedes-Benz, Skoda, and Volkswagen. The "PerfektBlue" attack
enables remote code execution through Bluetooth pairing, allowing
attackers to track vehicles, record audio, access phonebook data, and
potentially control steering/wipers. 

 CRITICAL MCP-REMOTE VULNERABILITY ENABLES REMOTE CODE EXECUTION,
IMPACTING 437,000+ DOWNLOADS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 CVE-2025-6514, a critical vulnerability in mcp-remote (CVSS 9.6),
allows arbitrary OS command execution when connecting to untrusted MCP
servers. The flaw affects versions 0.0.5-0.1.15 and has been patched
in 0.1.16. Other MCP vulnerabilities allowing for remote code
execution and sandbox escapes were also discovered in the Inspector
tool and Anthropic's Filesystem MCP Server.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW I DISCOVERED A LIBPNG VULNERABILITY 11 YEARS AFTER IT WAS PATCHED
(5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 While practicing secure code review, the author of this article
decided to review the libpng C library. They found that libpng
calculated memory allocations based on user-controlled values, such as
“depth.” The author was able to trigger a crash using a custom PNG
file, but then discovered that the bug was fixed 11 years ago when it
was first reported. 

 TAKING SHELLTER: A COMMERCIAL EVASION FRAMEWORK ABUSED IN- THE- WILD
(26 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Elastic Security Labs found threat actors using an illicit version of
SHELLTER, a red team evasion framework, since April to deploy
infostealers like LUMMA, RHADAMANTHYS, and ARECHCLIENT2. The malware
uses advanced evasion techniques such as polymorphic code, API hooking
bypasses, indirect syscalls, memory scan evasion, and AMSI bypass,
resulting in low detection rates. Elastic issued a dynamic unpacker
and YARA rules to help detect SHELLTER samples, which are spread via
YouTube comments and phishing campaigns targeting content creators. 

 ABUSING CHROME REMOTE DESKTOP ON RED TEAM OPERATIONS: A PRACTICAL
GUIDE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Red team operators can abuse Chrome Remote Desktop as a legitimate
remote access tool by installing the MSI package with admin privileges
and using an undocumented `--pin=111111` parameter to bypass GUI PIN
setup requirements. The technique leverages Google's infrastructure
and HTTPS/WebRTC protocols, making it more difficult to detect than
traditional remote access tools, as it appears as legitimate Google
traffic. Defenders should implement application allowlisting
solutions, such as AppLocker, and monitor for "Chrome Remote Desktop
Host" installations to prevent unauthorized remote access deployments.

 BROWSER EXTENSIONS TURN NEARLY 1M BROWSERS INTO WEBSITE-SCRAPING BOTS
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Browser extensions that use the MellowTel-js library are being used
to scrape websites using users' browsers. The library has close ties
with Olostep, a company that bills itself as “the world's most
reliable and cost-effective Web scraping API,” suggesting that
Olostep is using its installed base of extension users to fulfill
scraping requests. 245 extensions that implement this library have
been discovered across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, with a total of
nearly 1M users. 

 JACK DORSEY SAYS HIS ‘SECURE' NEW BITCHAT APP HAS NOT BEEN TESTED
FOR SECURITY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 After launching his new security-focused, Bluetooth chat app,
Bitchat, Jack Dorsey added a warning to its GitHub page that it has
not received an external security review and should not be used in
production. This disclaimer was prompted by a security researcher who
discovered a vulnerability that allowed them to impersonate someone
else by intercepting their “identity key” and “peer id pair.”
Other security researchers have reported concerns over Dorsey's claims
that Bitchat has forward secrecy, as well as reported a potential
buffer overflow bug. 

 GMX HALTS TRADING, TOKEN MINTING FOLLOWING $40M EXPLOIT (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 The GMX protocol halted trading on GMX V1, the first version of the
GMX perpetual exchange deployed on the Arbitrum network, after a
liquidity pool suffered an exploit that resulted in $40 million in
funds being stolen. The attacked pool is a liquidity provider for the
GMX protocol with underlying assets that include Bitcoin, Ether, and
stablecoins. Blockchain security company SlowMist attributed the
exploit to a design flaw that allowed hackers to manipulate the GLP
token price.

requirements, including quarterly security assessments, mandatory USIM
replacements, and organizational changes that the company expects will
cost $511 million in lost revenue. 

 FOUR ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH M&S AND CO-OP CYBER-ATTACKS (4
