 IS YOUR UNMANAGEABLE "STACK" DRIVING AWAY TECH TALENT? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 → 2 out of 5 IT pros are at high risk of burnout

→ 42% are thinking about quitting

→ 70% say leadership isn't doing enough to prevent it

Your legacy setup needs to shoulder a lot of the blame. Teams are
buried in alert storms, tool sprawl, siloed data, nonstop noise.
They've got no breathing room and their skills are underutilized.

The security stack's working against them: disconnected, reactive,
exhausting.

Learn how to kill the chaos and grunt work by moving to a converged,
cloud-native SASE platform. Free your teams to build and grow instead

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ORANGE BELGIUM DISCLOSES DATA BREACH IMPACTING 850,000 CUSTOMERS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Attackers breached Orange Belgium's IT systems in July, stealing
personal data of 850,000 customers, including names, phone numbers,
SIM card numbers, PUK codes, and tariff plans. The company detected
the breach at the end of July and confirmed that passwords, emails,
and financial information were not compromised. Orange Belgium
identified the threat group responsible, but hasn't disclosed its
identity. The company confirmed this was unrelated to China's Salt
Typhoon attacks targeting telecoms worldwide. 

 APPLE PATCHES CVE-2025-43300 ZERO-DAY IN IOS, IPADOS, AND MACOS
EXPLOITED IN TARGETED ATTACKS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Apple has patched CVE-2025-43300, a zero-day exploit in the ImageIO
framework that causes memory corruption via malicious images. It
affected iOS 18.6.2, iPadOS 18.6.2/17.7.10, and macOS Ventura 13.7.8,
Sonoma 14.7.8, and Sequoia 15.6.1. This is Apple's seventh zero-day
patch in 2025. 

 TPG TELECOM ESTIMATES 280K AFFECTED BY SUBSIDIARY BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 TPG Telecom's subsidiary iiNet suffered a data breach due to a stolen

are being notified.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RUSSIA-LINKED EUROPEAN ATTACKS RENEW CONCERNS OVER WATER
CYBERSECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Russian hackers probably sabotaged a Norwegian dam in April by
remotely opening valves for four hours. Poland also reported a
thwarted cyberattack that could have cut water to a major city. These
attacks, linked to groups like Z-Pentest Alliance, show water
facilities as vulnerable targets that could lead to bigger threats.
Water utilities should boost cybersecurity with more funding,
consulting, or free resources like the DEF CON Franklin project. 

 SPYVPN: THE GOOGLE-FEATURED VPN THAT SECRETLY CAPTURES YOUR SCREEN (7
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 FreeVPN.One, a popular VPN Chrome extension, secretly takes
screenshots of users' browsing—including sensitive info—and
uploads them to the developer's servers without consent. Despite
claiming to protect privacy, it abuses permissions, uses encryption to
evade detection, and provides misleading explanations, exposing
security flaws in Chrome extensions. 

 “SCAMLEXITY” WE PUT AGENTIC AI BROWSERS TO THE TEST - THEY
CLICKED, THEY PAID, THEY FAILED (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 As AI browsers like Comet take over online tasks, they're dangerously
vulnerable to scams and prompt injections, sometimes making purchases
or clicking harmful links without user awareness. Traditional fraud
techniques and new AI-targeted tricks can easily fool agentic AI,
making users pay the price. Security must be built into AI browsers
from the ground up, not treated as an afterthought, to protect users
in this new era of automated scamming.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CHALK (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Chalk captures metadata at build time and can add a small 'chalk
mark' (metadata) to any artifacts so that they can be identified in
production. It can also extract chalk marks and collect additional
metadata about the operating environment during this process. 

 BAMBOOZIEDR (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 BamboozIEDR is a comprehensive ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) event
generation tool for testing and research purposes. 

 RINGREAPER (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 RingReaper is a post-exploitation agent for Linux that utilizes
io_uring to minimize chances of being detected by EDR solutions.

 COPILOT BROKE YOUR AUDIT LOG, BUT MICROSOFT WON'T TELL YOU (8 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Microsoft's Copilot AI allowed users to access files in M365 without
leaving audit log records, creating potential security and compliance
risks. This was reported to Microsoft, which quietly fixed the issue
but chose not to notify customers or issue a formal security alert.
Any organization using Copilot before August 18 may have incomplete
audit logs and might be unaware of what happened. 

 HACKERS WHO EXPOSED NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT HACKER EXPLAIN WHY THEY
DID IT (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Two ethical hackers accessed a North Korean state hacker's computer
for months and uncovered evidence of cyberespionage and theft. They
leaked their findings to support cyber defense and expose
government-backed hacking activities, hoping their action would
inspire more transparency and accountability in global cybersecurity. 

 YOU DON'T NEED A VENDOR TO AUTOMATE SECURITY QUESTIONNAIRES (7 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Security questionnaires are a standard part of the security review
process that can often be tedious, time-consuming, and mechanical for
vendors' teams. Instead of buying a tool to handle this process,
vendors can either build their own RAG or use Claude/ChatGPT. To use
Claude/ChatGPT, prepare a folder with the relevant documents that
would be included in a Trust Center, as well as some previously
manually completed questionnaires.
