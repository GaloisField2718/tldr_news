 VIDEO: HOW WE BLOCKED A RANSOMWARE ATTACK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers used stolen domain admin credentials to infiltrate a
hospital network - aiming to deploy remote access tools, steal
sensitive data, and unleash ransomware.

Watch this short video [4] to learn how this attack crippled other
hospitals, and how ThreatLocker stopped it in its tracks [4]:

 	* Application Allowlisting blocked unauthorized software from
running.
 	* Storage Control prevented data from being accessed or moved.
 	* The attackers couldn't deploy tools.
 	* They couldn't spread.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SPARKKITTY SWIPES PICS FROM IOS, ANDROID DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 SparkKitty is a new mobile malware that harvests photos from users'
devices. The malware is delivered via fake or trojanized applications
on the App Store and a trojanized version of the TikTok app that users
are prompted to install via an Enterprise profile. Once installed, the
apps prompt users to grant the app access to their galleries and then
exfiltrate images to extract crypto seed phrases. 

 NEW FILEFIX ATTACK WEAPONIZES WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER FOR STEALTHY
COMMANDS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 FileFix, a variant of ClickFix attacks, is a new social engineering
attack vector on Windows devices. In ClickFix attacks, a user is
prompted by a website to execute a copied command in PowerShell to fix
a bogus error. However, in the FileFix attacks, the user just needs to
paste the command in the Windows File Explorer address bar, which is a
much more familiar environment. The FileFix ruse informs users that a
file was shared with them and prompts them to click a button that will
launch File Explorer and copy a PowerShell command that contains a
file path in a PowerShell comment to the clipboard. When the command
is pasted into the File Explorer address bar, only the path will be
displayed. 

 THREAT HUNTING INTRODUCTION: COBALT STRIKE (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cobalt Strike servers can be found online by scanning for their
distinctive HTTP response signatures - specifically 404 Not Found
responses with zero content length and text/plain content type.
Researchers can download executable payloads from these servers using
checksum-based URLs (like /tdN6 for x86 or /ZrJG for x64) and extract
encrypted configuration metadata that reveals how red teams and
malicious actors configure their command-and-control infrastructure.
This post provides a Rust tool called SigStrike to automate this
discovery and analysis process at scale across millions of potential
servers.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NO AGENT, NO PROBLEM: DISCOVERING REMOTE EDR (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The Performance Logs and Alerts DLL holds various DCOM interfaces
that allow someone to interact remotely with Event Tracing for Windows
(ETW) providers, trace sessions, configurations, etc. This post
demonstrates how these capabilities can be used to detect various
attacks without an agent and suggests ways that an attacker can use
them to maintain stealthy persistence. 

 AUTOMATICALLY PRIORITIZE SECURITY ISSUES FROM DIFFERENT TOOLS WITH AN
LLM (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Security issue prioritization is a complex and time-consuming process
that takes away time from resolving issues. This blog post proposes
three scoring strategies that an LLM can use to rank security issues
to combat this. The first strategy is to have the LLM assign a score
based on provided criteria to each issue and sort the issues based on
that score. The second strategy is to have the LLM use bubble sort and
compare each issue pair-wise, which is more thorough than the first
strategy but slower. The third strategy is to use an Elo system where
a random sampling of issues is compared. 

 UNEXPECTED SECURITY FOOTGUNS IN GO'S PARSERS (15 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Go's parsers for JSON, XML, and YAML have risky default behaviors
such as case-insensitive fields, duplicate key acceptance, and lenient
garbage data handling, which attackers can exploit to bypass security.
These differences lead to conflicting interpretations across services
processing the same input, causing vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-16250
in HashiCorp Vault. The new JSON v2 spec aims to fix these with secure
defaults, but current measures rely on custom validation and static
analysis.

 SECURITY QUESTIONNAIRES TAKING 3+ HOURS? THIS AI CUTS IT TO 15
MINUTES (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Tired of spending hours answering the same security questions while
deals languish in the pipeline? SafeBase [11] attacks this from both
ends: Trust Centers let prospects self-serve your security docs
upfront; if they still have questions, AI Questionnaire Assistance
generates accurate responses from your existing documentation. See a

 CYBERSECURITY AI (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 CAI is an open-source framework for building AI tools for
cybersecurity bug hunting and vulnerability testing. It uses agents
and tools to automate tasks, but lets humans guide and control the
process. 

 TNOK – NEXT GENERATION PORT SECURITY (10 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Tnok is a port security tool that employs time-based one-time
passwords (TOTP) as dynamic port knock sequences. It encodes 6-digit
2FA codes into network packets sent to the target port: for UDP, the
code is included in packet data, and for TCP, codes are encoded in TCP
options (like MD5 and Mood) or distributed across multiple SYN packets
via MSS values to avoid requiring root privileges. The system keeps
protected ports closed until a valid TOTP code is received, after
which it temporarily grants access without additional firewall
configuration. 

 KALI LINUX 2025.1C FIXES KEY ISSUE, ADDS NEW TOOLS AND INTERFACE
UPDATES (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Kali Linux lost its software signing key in April, causing update
errors for users with systems installed before that date and
potentially exposing them to security risks. Version 2025.1c fixes
this issue by including a new repository key. Older installations will
require manually downloading and installing the new key via a wget
command. The update also introduces a redesigned menu following the
MITRE ATT&CK framework and adds over a dozen new security tools,
including Azurehound, binwalk3, and bopscrk.

 WINDOWS 11'S CRUCIAL RESTORE POINTS NOW SELF-DESTRUCT AFTER 60 DAYS
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft announced that as of the June update, Windows 11 24H2,
restore points will only be stored for 60 days. Restore points are
used to restore a system to a known good state in the event of system
corruption. Before this update, restore points were stored for 90
days. 

 POLICE WARN OF SMS ‘BLASTER' SCAMS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Police warned about SMS "blaster" devices after Chinese student
Ruichen Xiong was jailed for over a year for using one to send
fraudulent messages while driving in London in March. These radio
devices lure phones from legitimate networks with stronger signals,
enabling criminals to send texts without phone numbers and bypass
anti-spam measures to conduct "smishing" attacks that steal personal
info. Experts suggest Android users disable 2G and iPhone users filter
unknown messages. Report suspicious texts to 7726. 

 CRYPTOMINERS' ANATOMY: SHUTTING DOWN MINING BOTNETS (5 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Akamai developed two techniques to shut down cryptomining botnets by
exploiting mining pool topologies and policies - submitting "bad
shares" (invalid hash calculations) that trigger automatic bans from
mining pools. The first technique targets mining proxies by connecting
as a fake miner and submitting consecutive bad shares, causing the
proxy to get banned and shutting down the entire botnet operation
(they reduced one campaign's hashrate from 3.3 million to zero). The
second technique floods public pools with thousands of fake login
attempts to temporarily disrupt direct pool connections, though this
method is less permanent than targeting proxies.

CONCERNS (3 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 The U.S. House has prohibited the use of WhatsApp on official devices

approved alternatives such as Microsoft Teams and Signal.
