 YOUR GUIDE TO TAMING SAAS CHAOS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 IT teams face an uphill battle to secure their company's SaaS apps.
There's dealing with on/offboarding, going through access reviews, and
manually managing permissions for every app that's not behind SSO. And
that's just for the apps you _know about_. So how can you manage the
chaos and finally get full visibility [4] over your SaaS ecosystem?

That's where SaaS management solutions come in. 1Password's latest
guide [4] explores proven strategies and tools to manage every app --
yes, even shadow IT.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OVER 73,000 WATCHGUARD FIREBOX DEVICES IMPACTED BY RECENT CRITICAL
FLAW (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A critical vulnerability in WatchGuard Firebox devices running
certain Fireware OS versions puts over 73,000 network firewalls at
risk of unauthenticated remote code execution. Despite patches being
released in September, tens of thousands of devices remain unpatched,
with the largest concentrations in the US and Europe. 

 MUJI'S MINIMALIST CALM SHATTERED AS RANSOMWARE TAKES DOWN LOGISTICS
PARTNER (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A ransomware attack on logistics partner Askul forced Japanese
retailer Muji to suspend online orders, affecting customers and
disrupting services. With Askul's systems nearly paralyzed, many
functions, including shipments and customer support, are down. No
ransomware group has claimed responsibility. 

 VULNERABILITY IN DOLBY DECODER CAN ALLOW ZERO-CLICK ATTACKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Google's Project Zero discovered a vulnerability in
Dolby's Unified Decoder that could lead to remote code execution.
Dolby Decoder is used by Android to locally decode all audio messages
and attachments. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ANALYSING CLICKFIX: 3 REASONS WHY COPY/PASTE ATTACKS ARE DRIVING
SECURITY BREACHES (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 ClickFix attacks trick users into copying and pasting malicious
commands from fake CAPTCHA prompts in web browsers, which are then
executed locally on their devices, with attacks spreading primarily
through SEO poisoning and malvertising rather than email. These
attacks exploit three key weaknesses: users lack awareness training
for copy-paste threats, detection evasion techniques bypass email
scanners and web proxies by using non-email delivery vectors and
heavily obfuscated code, and EDR becomes the sole defense layer since
malicious clipboard actions occur within the browser sandbox,
invisible to traditional security tools. Security professionals should
implement browser-based detection for malicious copy-paste operations,
enhance user training to recognize fake CAPTCHA prompts, and deploy
comprehensive endpoint monitoring since EDR remains the only reliable
detection point after users execute the commands. 

 LINUX CAPABILITIES REVISITED (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Linux capabilities enable fine-grained privilege management by
dividing root powers into independent units, but attackers can abuse
this by setting capabilities like cap_setuid on binaries (e.g.,
Python) to create stealthy backdoors without traditional SUID bits.
Security teams should expand privilege escalation hunting beyond
SUID/SGID files to include capability-enabled binaries using getcap -r
/ and monitor for setcap usage, as capabilities are stored in file
inodes under security.capability attributes invisible to standard ls
commands. Tools like LinPEAS and Elastic's detection rule for setcap
utility usage help identify suspicious capability assignments, while
getfattr can reveal hidden extended attributes that getcap decodes
into human-readable capability flags. 

 MICROSOFT 365 COPILOT – ARBITRARY DATA EXFILTRATION VIA MERMAID
DIAGRAMS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Microsoft 365 Copilot was vulnerable to a security flaw that allowed
sensitive business data, like recent emails, to be exfiltrated using
specially crafted documents. Attackers could embed hidden instructions
and a fake login button, which used Mermaid diagrams to send encoded
company data to servers under their control if a user clicked the
button. Microsoft fixed the vulnerability by disabling interactions
with dynamic Mermaid diagram content, effectively closing this
exfiltration route.

 NETWORK SECURITY DEVICES ENDANGER ORGS WITH '90S ERA FLAWS (3 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 Network edge devices like firewalls, VPNs, and email gateways have
become major security liabilities, with nearly one in three of the 75
zero-day vulnerabilities tracked by Google in 2024 targeting these
appliances. The exploited vulnerabilities consist primarily of basic
1990s-era flaws such as buffer overflows, command injections, and SQL
injections—vulnerability classes that have well-established
prevention and detection controls, yet persist in security vendors'
mission-critical codebases. Security professionals should prioritize
patching network appliances immediately when vulnerabilities are
disclosed, implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for edge
devices, and pressure vendors to adopt modern secure development
practices, including memory-safe languages and rigorous code auditing.


 HUNDREDS OF MASKED ICE AGENTS DOXXED BY HACKERS, AS PERSONAL DETAILS
POSTED ON TELEGRAM (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The Com hacking collective leaked personal information of hundreds of
US government employees, including 680 DHS officials, over 170 FBI
email addresses, and 190+ Department of Justice officials on private
Telegram channels, with unclear data origins. The doxxing coincides
with DHS warnings about Mexican cartels allegedly targeting ICE and
CBP agents with bounties, and hackers claimed interest in
million-dollar rewards while threatening to target IRS officials next.
Security professionals should implement enhanced operational security
for government personnel, monitor dark web channels for leaked PII,
and review data handling procedures to identify potential breach
sources, particularly given The Com's history of high-profile attacks
against MGM Resorts, Coinbase, and others. 

 APPLE ALERTS EXPLOIT DEVELOPER THAT HIS IPHONE WAS TARGETED WITH
GOVERNMENT SPYWARE (4 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 A former Trenchant (L3Harris subsidiary) iOS exploit developer
received an Apple threat notification in March indicating his personal
iPhone was targeted with mercenary spyware, potentially marking the
first documented case of spyware developers being targeted by their
own tools. The developer, pseudonymously called Jay Gibson, was fired
from Trenchant weeks earlier after being accused of leaking Chrome
zero-days despite working exclusively on iOS exploits, which he and
former colleagues deny. Security professionals should note that
Apple's threat notification system detects sophisticated targeting
even when forensic analysis finds no infection traces, suggesting
either failed attack attempts or increasingly stealthy spyware that
leaves minimal forensic evidence.

3.5 million merchants that could have enabled attackers to drain
hundreds of millions of dollars from merchant accounts.
