ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 EXPERTS FOUND AN UNSECURED 16TB DATABASE CONTAINING 4.3B PROFESSIONAL
RECORDS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 An unsecured 16TB MongoDB database was discovered on November 23. The
database contained 4.3 billion professional records, including
LinkedIn-like data such as names, emails, phone numbers, job roles,
employers, work histories, and social media accounts. It was secured
two days after discovery, but prior access remains unknown. This
exposed data could facilitate large-scale AI-powered social
engineering, phishing attacks, CEO fraud, and credential stuffing by
enabling automated personalized messaging and profile enrichment when
combined with other breach data. Security teams should urgently
monitor threat intelligence, improve email security to prevent
AI-driven phishing, and train users to recognize advanced social
engineering that exploits professional profiles. 

 FAKE OSINT AND GPT UTILITY GITHUB REPOS SPREAD PYSTORERAT MALWARE
PAYLOADS (5 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A campaign attributed to likely Eastern European threat actors is
distributing PyStoreRAT malware through GitHub repositories disguised
as OSINT tools, GPT wrappers, and DeFi bots, using artificially
inflated star counts and social media promotion to build credibility.
The modular JavaScript-based RAT executes via mshta.exe, scans for
cryptocurrency wallets, evades detection by CrowdStrike and
Cybereason, and delivers the Rhadamanthys infostealer as a secondary
payload. Security teams should audit dependencies from trending GitHub
repositories, monitor for scheduled tasks masquerading as NVIDIA
updates, and deploy endpoint detection and response solutions capable
of identifying mshta.exe activity and JavaScript-based payloads to
strengthen defenses against PyStoreRAT. 

 FEATURED CHROME BROWSER EXTENSION CAUGHT INTERCEPTING MILLIONS OF
USERS' AI CHATS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A widely trusted Chrome and Edge extension, Urban VPN Proxy, was
updated in 2025 to inject JavaScript that hooks network APIs, silently
captures all AI chatbot prompts and responses, plus metadata, and then
sends them to Urban VPN's analytics servers. The data is shared with
parent company BIScience for commercial insights, despite “AI
protection” marketing and a privacy policy that downplays risks.
Security teams should review browser extension permissions, monitor
network traffic for unusual API calls, and enforce policies
restricting the installation of unverified extensions to prevent data
exfiltration by malicious extensions such as Urban VPN Proxy.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 NEW ADVANCED PHISHING KITS USE AI AND MFA BYPASS TACTICS TO STEAL
CREDENTIALS AT SCALE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Four new phishing-as-a-service kits have emerged: BlackForce
($200-300, MFA bypass via Man-in-the-Browser attacks), GhostFrame
(iframe-based evasion with 1M+ attacks), InboxPrime AI ($1,000
perpetual license with AI-generated emails mimicking Gmail behavior),
and Spiderman (targeting European banks via Signal with OTP/PhotoTAN
interception). These kits feature anti-analysis techniques, real-time
credential exfiltration to Telegram, and spintax-based email variation
to bypass signature detection. Organizations should implement
phishing-resistant MFA, such as FIDO2, and monitor for the emerging
Salty-Tycoon hybrid, which combines multiple kit techniques to evade
detection rules. 

 OPERATION MONEYMOUNT-ISO — DEPLOYING PHANTOM STEALER VIA
ISO-MOUNTED EXECUTABLES (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A new group is running a phishing campaign that impersonates payment
confirmations to trick finance-related staff into opening a ZIP file
containing a malicious ISO image. Once mounted and executed, the ISO
drops a multi-stage payload chain that ultimately runs Phantom
Stealer, which uses DLL injection, anti-analysis checks, and
steganography to load and hide its code. The stealer targets browser
credentials, cookies, credit cards, crypto wallets, Discord tokens,
clipboard data, keystrokes, and selected files, then exfiltrates
everything via Telegram bots, Discord webhooks, or FTP. 

 STILLEPOST- OR HOW TO PROXY YOUR C2'S HTTP TRAFFIC THROUGH CHROMIUM
(7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) allows tools to inspect, debug,
instrument, and profile Chrome and other Chromium browsers. CDP
provides a tempting target for C2 communication because the traffic
can blend in with existing traffic and because browsers are usually
already configured with appropriate proxy and firewall information.
This post demonstrates a C2 implant that uses CDP to run in a headless
browser and communicate with the C2 server via XHR requests driven by
CDP JavaScript.

 VOLKLOCKER RANSOMWARE EXPOSED BY HARD-CODED MASTER KEY ALLOWING FREE
DECRYPTION (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Pro-Russian hacktivist group CyberVolk's new VolkLocker
ransomware-as-a-service contains a critical implementation flaw that
hard-codes AES-256 master keys in binaries and writes them to a
plaintext file in the %TEMP% folder, enabling free decryption without
paying the ransom. The Golang-based malware targets Windows and Linux
systems, featuring privilege escalation, VM detection, shadow copy
deletion, and a 48-hour enforcement timer that wipes user folders if
payment isn't made. Victims should check for the system_backup.key
file in their Temp directory before considering a ransom payment, as
this oversight renders the $800-$2,200 RaaS offering ineffective for
attackers. 

 JLR: PAYROLL DATA STOLEN IN CYBERCRIME THAT SHOOK UK ECONOMY (3
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Jaguar Land Rover confirms that a cyberattack in August not only
halted factory production, it also exposed payroll data for current
and former staff, including bank details and tax information. The
incident has driven reported sales losses of £1.5 billion, plus £196
million in related losses, and is estimated to have cost the broader
UK economy up to £2.1 billion, with the Scattered Lapsus Hunters
group blamed. 

 THIRD DRAFTKINGS HACKER PLEADS GUILTY (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Nathan Austad, a 21-year-old from Minnesota known as “Snoopy,”
admitted to helping run a credential stuffing scheme that compromised
over 60,000 betting-site accounts, drained roughly $600,000 from about
1,600 victims, and sold access via online shops. He now faces up to
five years in prison and is the third defendant tied to the
DraftKings-related hacks.
