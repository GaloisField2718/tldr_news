ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 WHATSAPP ISSUES EMERGENCY UPDATE FOR ZERO-CLICK EXPLOIT TARGETING IOS
AND MACOS DEVICES (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 WhatsApp has released an emergency security update to patch a
critical zero-click exploit that allows attackers to remotely
compromise iOS and macOS devices without any user interaction. The
vulnerability affects WhatsApp's voice calling feature, allowing
attackers to execute malicious code by simply initiating a call, even
if the target doesn't answer. Users are strongly urged to update their
WhatsApp applications immediately to protect against potential attacks
exploiting this serious security flaw. 

 ATTACKERS ABUSE VELOCIRAPTOR FORENSIC TOOL TO DEPLOY VISUAL STUDIO
CODE FOR C2 TUNNELING (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat actors are using the Velociraptor forensic tool to deploy
Visual Studio Code for command and control tunneling. The attackers
are exploiting Velociraptor's endpoint monitoring to download and run
Visual Studio Code, likely to establish persistent backdoor access.
This follows the trend of cybercriminals exploiting trusted tools to
evade detection and maintain covert channels. 

 BROKEWELL ANDROID MALWARE DELIVERED THROUGH FAKE TRADINGVIEW ADS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 There is a malware campaign that uses Meta ads offering a free
version of the TradingView Premium app to spread the Brokewell malware
for Android. The malicious ads direct users to a webpage that mimics
TradingView's site and prompts users to download an APK file, which
installs the Brokewell malware. The malware scans for crypto wallets
and bank accounts, steals 2FA codes, steals accounts by overlaying
fake login screens, records screens and keystrokes, steals cookies,
activates the camera and microphone, tracks the device location,
hijacks the default SMS apps, and provides remote control capability.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TAMPEREDCHEF INFOSTEALER DELIVERED THROUGH FRAUDULENT PDF EDITOR (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The TamperedChef infostealer malware is being distributed through
fake PDF editing applications promoted via Google ads across multiple
malicious websites. The fraudulent PDF editor appears legitimate but
secretly installs the TamperedChef malware designed to steal sensitive
information from infected systems. This campaign demonstrates how
cybercriminals continue to exploit trusted advertising platforms and
standard software to deliver malware to unsuspecting users. 

 MACOS SECURITY AND TYPICAL ATTACKS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post analyzes how attackers bypass macOS' built-in security
mechanisms, including Keychain, SIP, TCC, File Quarantine, and
Gatekeeper, through techniques such as TCC Clickjacking, quarantine
attribute removal, and social engineering attacks that require context
menu execution. The analysis provides detection rules in Sigma format
to identify malicious activities, such as keychain dumping, SIP status
discovery, quarantine removal, and Gatekeeper disabling, through
command-line utilities. Organizations should implement third-party EDR
solutions in conjunction with native macOS protections, as attackers
continue to adapt and circumvent Apple's security frameworks through
techniques such as privilege escalation and user manipulation. 

 HUNTING MALICIOUS SHORTCUT (.LNK) FILES USING THE VIRUSTOTAL API (9
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers frequently utilize shortcut files as an initial access
vector, as they can obscure malicious commands from a user. In this
post, the author compiled a corpus of 614 malicious LNK files using
the VirusTotal API and employed frequency analysis to extract common
command-line arguments from malicious shortcuts that execute
PowerShell or CMD. The author then utilized KQL to construct threat
hunting queries that search for malicious LNK files using this corpus
of data.

 INFOGRAPHIC: THE IMPACT OF COMPLIANCE AUTOMATION ON RISK (SPONSOR)
[11] 

 Almost anything worth doing creates some level of risk. But without
mapping or monitoring, your company security posture is constantly
under pressure. Grab this OneTrust infographic [11] for a quick
overview of the gap between regulations and resourcing, and how you
can mitigate risk with compliance automation. Download → [11] 

 FOUNDING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Founding is a tool that processes shellcode in .bin, .exe, or .dll
formats, applying advanced obfuscation or encryption techniques to
generate stealthy binaries with sophisticated execution methods. 

 JAMFHOUND (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 JamfHound is a Python 3 project designed to collect and identify
attack paths in Jamf Pro and import them as JSON object files into
BloodHound.

 LAB DOOKHTEGAN HACKING GROUP DISRUPTS COMMUNICATIONS ON DOZENS OF
IRANIAN SHIPS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Lab Dookhtegan hacking group allegedly disrupted communications
systems on 60 Iranian ships, including 39 tankers and 25 cargo vessels
operated by sanctioned companies National Iranian Oil Tanker Company
(NITC) and Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL). The cyberattack targeted the
maritime communication infrastructure of these state-linked shipping
firms, potentially impacting their ability to coordinate operations
and maintain contact with shore-based facilities. This incident
demonstrates the growing trend of hacktivists targeting critical
maritime infrastructure as part of geopolitical cyber operations. 

 APPLICATION SECURITY ENGINEER ARCHETYPES (8 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The author of this post reflects on his time as an AppSec engineer in
various organizations and divides AppSec roles into three buckets:
AppSec Engineer in a Centralized Organization, Dedicated AppSec
Engineer, and Security Partner Engineer. The author also classifies
AppSec Engineers as either orchestrators, builders, specialists, or
rapid responders. The post concludes with a mapping of the roles each
archetype excels in and the prime traits essential for each archetype
to succeed. 

 WHY RELYING ON LLMS FOR CODE CAN BE A SECURITY NIGHTMARE (3 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A security researcher demonstrates how LLM-generated code can contain
serious security flaws, such as exposing an email API with hardcoded
parameters in client-side JavaScript. This allows attackers to spam
recipients with simple curl commands. LLMs learn from insecure
internet examples and replicate these patterns, often prioritizing
functionality over security. Organizations require human oversight for
security reviews and threat modeling when utilizing AI-generated code,
as LLMs lack an understanding of security risks and potential for
abuse.
