TLDR INFORMATION SECURITY 2025-08-26

 TEST SECURITY RULES LIKE CODE WITH THE FASTLY WAF SIMULATOR (SPONSOR)
[4] 

 For developers, treating is sacrosanct. In security, it's too often
an afterthought - WAF rules are only validated during pentesting... or
in an actual attack.

Fastly's new WAF Simulator [4] lets you validate WAF rules with
integrated, continuous, automated security testing that doesn't
interrupt the development flow:

 	* Request/response simulation to test expected rule behavior
 	* Visibility into rule-based signals: bot analysis, business logic
enforcement, and block status codes
 	* Custom rule validation with CVE tagging or complex logic

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH IMPACTS OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A data breach at Farmers Insurance, disclosed via a third-party
vendor, exposed personal information of over one million people,
including names and Social Security numbers. The insurer was not
directly hacked; the sensitive data was stolen from a compromised
external database. Authorities and affected individuals have been
notified. 

 DOCKER FIXES CVE-2025-9074, CRITICAL CONTAINER ESCAPE VULNERABILITY
WITH CVSS SCORE 9.3 (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Docker patched a critical container escape flaw (CVSS 9.3) affecting
Windows and macOS. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-9074) allowed attackers
to access host files from within containers, posing major risks to
containerized environments. 

 AUCHAN RETAILER DATA BREACH IMPACTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
CUSTOMERS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 French retailer Auchan is notifying “several hundred thousand”
customers that sensitive data linked to their loyalty accounts was
exposed in a cyberattack. The breached data includes names, titles,
client status, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, and loyalty
card numbers. The company says that no financial details or passwords
were impacted.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USING TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC ANALYSIS TO TRACK THREAT ACTOR TARGETING
(9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog explores how intelligence analysts can distinguish
objective victimology from subjective threat actor motivations when
reporting on “targeted” sectors. Analysts can ensure consistent,
data-driven threat assessments by leveraging standardized industry
classifications (ISIC, NACE, and NAICS) and linking tactical evidence
to strategic assertions in Synapse. Storm queries help validate that
strategic conclusions about targeting are backed by concrete,
observable evidence. 

 RAISING SECURITY WITH ORGANIZATION-WIDE YUBIKEY (FIDO2) IN ENTRA ID
(17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Hunt & Hackett details its end-to-end YubiKey FIDO2 rollout for
Microsoft Entra ID, using phased conditional access enforcement to
mandate phishing-resistant hardware authentication for specific users
and actions. Its approach includes automated Temporary Access Pass
(TAP) provisioning for onboarding and fallback, access packages for
exceptions, and robust monitoring of breakglass accounts. Key lessons
include session token control and cross-platform testing prior to full
enforcement. 

 SAFEGUARDING VS CODE AGAINST PROMPT INJECTIONS (9 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Prompt injection attacks in VS Code's Copilot Chat could allow
malicious actors to leak data or execute code by embedding crafted
prompts in GitHub issues. GitHub responded with security improvements
like enhanced confirmation flows, tool execution restrictions, and
sandboxed environments. The post also recommends Workspace Trust and
containerization as defenses, emphasizing the need for ongoing
protection as LLM threats evolve.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 SOME APIS KEEP SECRETS. YOURS MIGHT NOT. (SPONSOR) [12] 

 Three years after the Optus breach exposed millions of customer
records, Intruder's [13] research team went hunting for the same
broken API authorization flaws. They found:

 	* Microsoft credentials sitting in an unauthenticated config
endpoint.
 	* 60,000+ Salesforce records with PII completely exposed.
 	* SQL injection on a multinational company's training API.

…all discoverable because these companies documented their APIs
publicly. (See the actual examples here [12])

These are basic weaknesses that even an unskilled attacker could
exploit, but are equally easy to miss. Intruder's AUTOSWAGGER is a
free tool that helps you avoid these simple-but-catastrophic mistakes.

 AZURE APPHUNTER (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 Azure AppHunter is an open-source PowerShell tool designed for
security researchers, red teamers, and defenders. It identifies
excessive or risky permissions granted to Azure Service Principals,
helping teams uncover misconfigurations and enforce least privilege. 

 ENTRAROLEREAPER (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 EntraRoleReaper audits Entra ID users' role assignments by comparing
them to actual operations performed over a selected time period. The
tool supports least privilege reviews and helps reduce unnecessary
role sprawl in Microsoft Entra ID environments. 

 ANTIDEBUG (GITHUB REPO) [16] 

 AntiDebug is a terminal-based tool for testing x86_64 Windows
anti-debugging techniques. It provides a hands-on environment for
analyzing and understanding various methods malware may use to detect
or evade debuggers.

MISCELLANEOUS

 PHISHING EMAILS ARE NOW AIMED AT USERS AND AI DEFENSES (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Phishing campaigns are now embedding AI prompt injection commands
within emails to manipulate automated analysis tools while
simultaneously targeting users with credential harvesting tactics.
These hidden prompts instruct AI models to enter reasoning loops
rather than flag malicious content, increasing the risk of delayed
detection or false negatives in SOC workflows. This dual-track
approach highlights attackers' growing awareness of AI-based defenses
and their efforts to bypass both human and machine detection systems. 

 DOCKER EXPLAINED: FINALLY UNDERSTAND CONTAINERS WITHOUT LOSING YOUR
MIND (7 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 This guide breaks down Docker in plain terms: containers package code
with dependencies to avoid the “works on my machine” problem. It
covers key concepts like `Dockerfile` “recipes,” `docker build`
commands for creating layered images, registries for storing images,
and `docker run` for execution. Containers offer faster, more
consistent, isolated, and efficient environments for running
applications across systems. 

 INTENT OVER TACTICS: A CISO'S GUIDE TO PROTECTING YOUR CROWN JEWELS
(10 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 This article outlines a strategic approach to security by identifying
and protecting your organization's “crown jewels,” the most
critical assets, systems, or people. These may include intellectual
property, CI/CD pipelines, backup infrastructure, or key personnel.
Instead of reacting to specific attacker tactics, the approach
emphasizes understanding attacker intent and designing layered
defenses around the assets most likely to be targeted. The process is
recursive, expanding protections outward from the crown jewel.
