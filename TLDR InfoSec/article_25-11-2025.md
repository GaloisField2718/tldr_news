ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 SHADOWPAD MALWARE ACTIVELY EXPLOITS WSUS VULNERABILITY FOR FULL
SYSTEM ACCESS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Threat actors are actively exploiting CVE-2025-59287, a critical
deserialization RCE flaw in Microsoft WSUS (patched last month), to
deploy ShadowPad malware with SYSTEM privileges. The attack chain uses
PowerCat for initial shell access, then certutil/curl to download
ShadowPad, which persists via DLL side-loading through a legitimate
ELAN binary (ETDCtrlHelper.exe). Exploitation accelerated after public
PoC release. Patch immediately and audit WSUS exposure. 

 CRITICAL 7 ZIP VULNERABILITY WITH PUBLIC EXPLOIT REQUIRES MANUAL
UPDATE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CVE-2025-11001 is a directory traversal RCE flaw (CVSS 7.0) in
7-Zip's symbolic link handling that allows arbitrary code execution
when users extract malicious ZIP files. A public PoC exploit is
available, and Microsoft is tracking active weaponization. It was
fixed in version 25.00, but 7-Zip lacks auto-update capability,
leaving widespread unpatched installations. Inventory all Windows
systems with 7-Zip versions below 25.01 and immediately push updates
via Intune or deployment scripts. 

 COX ENTERPRISES DISCLOSES ORACLE E-BUSINESS SUITE DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Hackers exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in Oracle
E-Business Suite to breach Cox Enterprises' network, exposing personal
information of nearly 9,500 people. The attack, linked to the Cl0p
ransomware group, went unnoticed for weeks and resulted in data being
published on the dark web. Cox is offering free identity monitoring,
but did not specify which personal data was exposed. It will continue
its investigation.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A REVERSE ENGINEER'S ANATOMY OF THE MACOS BOOT CHAIN & SECURITY
ARCHITECTURE (30 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The macOS boot process on Apple Silicon is anchored in hardware-level
security. It begins with an immutable Boot ROM that uses cryptographic
hardware keys fused into silicon to validate and decrypt critical boot
components. A layered chain of trust is established, where each boot
stage verifies the next using strict signature checks and hardware
root keys, preventing execution of unauthorized code. Apple's custom
extensions to the Arm architecture provide pointer authentication,
branch target enforcement, and a secure execution environment with
isolated privilege levels. The Secure Enclave acts as an independent
computer managing cryptographic keys, enforcing anti-replay
protections, and mediating sensitive data access via a mailbox
interface. These mechanisms robustly defend against rollback, replay,
and tampering attacks throughout the boot chain. 

 ALL PATHS LEAD TO YOUR CLOUD: A MAPPING OF INITIAL ACCESS VECTORS TO
YOUR AWS ENVIRONMENT (20 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS initial access vectors can be categorized into two classes:
service exposure (Lambda, EC2, ECR, and DataSync misconfigurations
that enable public access) and access by design (Cognito, IAM, and IoT
misconfigurations in services intended for access control). 97% of
organizations still use IAM users despite best practices recommending
roles. 84% use Cognito with potential self-registration risks. ECR
repositories are enumerable by any AWS account holder. Security teams
should audit resource-based policies for wildcard principals, enforce
ExternalId for cross-account role assumptions, disable Cognito
self-registration where unnecessary, and validate OIDC trust policy
conditions include proper sub/aud claims. 

 PRACTICAL RESOURCES FOR DETECTION ENGINEERS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Detection engineering is a proactive threat-hunting specialization
that applies software engineering processes to detect attackers.
Prospective detection engineers should choose a domain to focus on,
such as cloud workload security, cloud application security, cloud
misconfigurations, endpoint security, network security, IAM, or
insider threat. This blog post includes a list of blog posts, videos,
and books that both starters and pros could benefit from.

 SHAI-HULUD RETURNS: OVER 300 NPM PACKAGES INFECTED VIA FAKE BUN
RUNTIME WITHIN HOURS (9 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Over 300 NPM packages were poisoned via compromised maintainer
accounts that injected a fake Bun runtime preinstall script that
deploys a 10MB obfuscated JavaScript payload to steal credentials. The
malware uses TruffleHog for local secret scanning. It exfiltrates NPM
tokens and cloud credentials (AWS/GCP/Azure) via rogue GitHub Action
runners named SHA1HULUD, and achieves worm-like propagation by
republishing infected packages using stolen tokens. High-impact
packages affected include @zapier/zapier-sdk (2.6M weekly downloads),
posthog-node, and @asyncapi/specs. Teams should audit dependencies for
setup_bun.js/bun_environment.js files, rotate any potentially exposed
credentials, and pin package versions to known-good releases. 

 GOOGLE ENABLES PIXEL-TO-IPHONE FILE SHARING VIA QUICK SHARE, AIRDROP
(3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Google has enabled Quick Share interoperability with Apple AirDrop on
Pixel 10 devices. The feature was implemented in Rust to eliminate
memory-safety vulnerabilities. NetSPI penetration testing confirmed no
data leakages. The system uses direct device-to-device connections via
AirDrop's “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode without server
intermediaries. However, users must manually verify recipient devices
to avoid accidental sharing with nearby strangers. Security teams
should note that this expands the cross-platform attack surface for
social-engineering file transfers. 

 NEW RADZARAT SPYWARE POSES AS FILE MANAGER TO HIJACK ANDROID DEVICES
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 RadzaRat is an Android RAT masquerading as a file manager with
complete AV evasion (0/66 on VirusTotal) and keylogging capabilities.
The malware uses free infrastructure (Render.com and a Telegram bot)
and persistence mechanisms that prevent termination and survive
reboots. The APK has been openly distributed and actively sold on
underground forums by developer 'Heron44' since November 8. Security
teams should implement behavioral detection and app vetting policies,
as signature-based defenses are currently ineffective against this
threat targeting credentials and financial data.
