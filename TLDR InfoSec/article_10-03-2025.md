[4] 

 TOMORROW: Join ThreatLocker Co-Founder & CEO Danny Jenkins and a
Forrester expert to reveal key insights from the new Total Economic
Impact™ of ThreatLocker [4] study by Forrester. On the agenda:

 	* The ROI and savings organizations achieved with ThreatLocker's
Zero Trust Endpoint Protection Platform.
 	* How companies reduced addressable security incidents by 99% [4]
and improved labor efficiency by 50%.
 	* Practical strategies to enhance security, streamline compliance,
and minimize risk.

As a bonus, all registrants will get exclusive early access to the
full study [4] after the webinar. Register for free here [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NTT COMMUNICATIONS SUFFERS DATA BREACH IMPACTING 18,000 COMPANIES (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 NTT Communications has disclosed a data breach affecting nearly
18,000 companies after detecting unauthorized access to its Order
Information Distribution System on February 5. The breach exposed
customer contract details, corporate contact information, and service
usage data. 

 ETHEREUM PRIVATE KEY STEALER ON PYPI DOWNLOADED OVER 1K TIMES (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The PyPI package "set-utils" targets Ethereum developers using the
eth-account library. The package hooks the from_key and
from_mnewmonic() functions in the ethereum package to intercept
private keys, encrypt them, and upload them to the Polygon blockchain.
Polygon transactions have very low processing fees, no rate limits,
and free public RPC endpoints, enabling attackers to retrieve the keys
at any point without requiring their own infrastructure. 

 UNDOCUMENTED COMMANDS FOUND IN BLUETOOTH CHIP USED BY A BILLION
DEVICES (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Tarlogic Security discovered 29 undocumented
commands in the firmware of the ESP32 Bluetooth device. The commands
could allow for memory manipulation, MAC address spoofing, and
LMP/LLCP packet injection. While the commands could open the door for
supply chain attacks, a more realistic threat would be a physical
attacker establishing persistence and performing further attacks
through the ESP32's memory.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 REVERSING SAMSUNG'S H-ARX HYPERVISOR FRAMEWORK (17 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Mobile devices lead security with defense-in-depth strategies, moving
sensitive data from untrusted kernels to higher trust levels like
hypervisors and secure enclaves. Samsung's Real-time Kernel Protection
(RKP), part of Knox on Exynos devices, uses H-Arx Hypervisor to
protect the kernel. The post discusses how to reverse the hypervisor
framework, which includes a common core (harx.bin) and loadable
plug-ins in a proprietary uH format. 

 ABUSING VBS ENCLAVES TO CREATE EVASIVE MALWARE (9 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 VBS enclaves allow a Windows user to run code in an isolated memory
region that even the “standard” kernel cannot access. This
presents an appealing attack surface for malware, as VBS malware would
be invisible to EDR running in the standard kernel, but the VBS
enclave code must be signed by Microsoft. This post explores bypassing
the Microsoft checks by abusing debuggable enclave modules or
exploiting vulnerable enclaves. 

 NOT LOST IN TRANSLATION: ROSETTA 2 ARTIFACTS IN MACOS INTRUSIONS (8
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Rosetta 2 technology creates AOT files on Apple Silicon Macs,
essential for analyzing macOS intrusions, even if malware is erased.
Mandiant found that sophisticated actors target cryptocurrency firms
with x86-64 malware due to its wider compatibility and lenient
execution policies compared to ARM64. These AOT files, stored in
protected cache directories, can uncover critical intrusion evidence
through timestamps, execution patterns, and binary features, even
after deleting malicious files.

 SAAS SECURITY THREAT REPORT: TRADITIONAL DEFENSES ARE FAILING AGAINST
NEW ATTACK PATTERNS (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Drawing from the industry's largest SaaS breach data repository and
direct involvement in over 150 incident responses alongside firms like
GuidePoint, Wipro, and Kroll, this report by Obsidian Security [11]
covers:

 	* The 300% surge in SaaS breaches in 2024, and what's causing it
 	* The biggest threats seen in the data, and who's most at risk
 	* Why traditional defenses are failing against new SaaS attack
patterns and why identities are the new frontline
 	* What to watch for this year and beyond

 ATT&CK EVALUATIONS LIBRARY (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The ATT&CK Emulation Library hosts adversary emulation plans from
published ATT&CK Evaluations. These plans emulate specific
adversaries, like Turla, covering initial access to exfiltration.
Organized by evaluation and threat actors, they simulate real
breaches.

that crashed servers and a kill switch that locked thousands of
employees out when he was fired in September 2019. Lu now faces up to
ten years imprisonment.

passwords in a "Nearby" tab. This feature could be useful for linking
travel documents to airports or healthcare documents to doctors'
offices. 1Password ensures that location data is not stored, shared,
or tracked, with all nearby checks conducted on the device.
