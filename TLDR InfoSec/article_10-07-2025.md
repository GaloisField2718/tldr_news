 🆕 SNEAK PEEK: STOP MANUALLY FIXING COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS WITH
CIMTRAK'S NEW ONE-CLICK REMEDIATION (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional compliance tools just tell you what's broken—they don't
fix it. You're left manually reconfiguring systems while sitting
helplessly out of compliance.

CimTrak's new Compliance & Configuration Remediation (CCR) module [4]
shows you exactly HOW YOUR SYSTEMS ALIGN WITH CIS BENCHMARKS AND DISA
STIGS, then lets you AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURE THEM TO COMPLIANCE WITH
ONE CLICK while maintaining COMPLETE AUDIT TRAILS.

No more manual remediation. No more compliance gaps. No more grueling
audit prep. Just instant visibility and one-click fixes (that you can
safely revert if needed).

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PERSONAL INFORMATION BELONGING TO CUSTOMERS OF PADDY POWER AND
BETFAIR COMPROMISED IN DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Personal information of customers at bookmakers Paddy Power and
Betfair has been compromised in a data breach. The parent company,
Flutter, notified customers via email that usernames, emails, contact
details, first lines of addresses, and cities or towns might have been
accessed, but no passwords, ID documents, or payment data were
affected. 

 VIRGINIA COUNTY SAYS APRIL RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSED EMPLOYEE SSNS (1
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The county of Gloucester in Virginia notified over 3,500 employees
that their personal information was stolen in an April breach. The
stolen data includes names, driver's license numbers, bank account
information, health insurance numbers, medical information, and SSNs.
The BlackSuit ransomware gang took credit for the breach but the
county did not confirm this. 

 NEW SERVICENOW FLAW LETS ATTACKERS ENUMERATE RESTRICTED DATA (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A new flaw in ServiceNow, named Count(er) Strike, allows users to
view restricted data by counting records without full access. It was
identified by Varonis Threat Labs in February under CVE-2025-3648. The
vulnerability is particularly relevant for configurations with
misconfigured or overly permissive ACLs. While ServiceNow introduced
new access control frameworks in the latest versions, administrators
are advised to review their tables to ensure data security.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ENFORCING LEAST PRIVILEGE IN AWS IAM WITH ACCESS ANALYZER AND LAST
ACCESS DATA (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post demonstrates how to utilize AWS IAM Access Analyzer to
audit external access, followed by further fine-tuning with Last
Access Data to identify unused permissions. Policies can then be
refined by using CloudTrail to view the actual API calls made by a
role and feeding those into the IAM Policy Simulator to determine the
minimum required permissions. Least privilege reviews can be automated
using Lambda, and real-time detection can be enabled using CloudTrail
with EventBridge. 

 HEY ARNOLD: A GUIDE TO ALL THE AMAZON RESOURCE IDENTIFIER FORMATS IN
AWS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Fog Security conducted a comprehensive investigation to identify all
the various AWS ARN formats and discovered nearly 2,000 different ARNs
supported by AWS IAM. While most ARNs follow a standard format of
`arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id`, some omit the
account-id, some require a namespace, and there are other
inconsistencies and duplication. Fog released a searchable listing of
all ARNs as well as JSONs of all ARN formats and all service prefixes.


 BURIED IN THE LOG. EXPLOITING A 20 YEARS OLD NTFS VULNERABILITY (27
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This research reveals a 20-year-old NTFS vulnerability
(CVE-2025-49689) that can be exploited via crafted Virtual Hard Disk
(VHD) files, causing an integer overflow during mounting. Malicious
VHDs bypass Log File Service (LFS) validation, enabling out-of-bounds
memory reads and kernel-level code execution through pointer hijacking
and IO_RING primitives. It shows how legacy filesystem code remains a
target, especially with modern file formats used in phishing
campaigns.

 PLANTING A TRADECRAFT GARDEN (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 The Tradecraft Garden is a collection of projects centered around the
development of position-independent DLL loaders. 

 INTRODUCING KINGFISHER: REAL-TIME SECRET DETECTION AND VALIDATION (21
MINUTE READ) [13] 

 MongoDB's Kingfisher is an open-source secret scanning tool built in
Rust that actively validates discovered secrets against external APIs
and cloud services in real-time to eliminate false positives. Unlike
other scanners that simply flag potential secrets, Kingfisher uses
advanced pattern matching with Hyperscan, multi-language parsing with
Tree-sitter, and dynamic validation to confirm whether detected
credentials are active and pose security risks. The tool runs
on-premises to keep data local, supports 700+ detection rules across
cloud platforms, and outperforms tools like TruffleHog and GitLeaks in
MongoDB's benchmarks.

 PUBLIC EXPLOITS RELEASED FOR CITRIX BLEED 2 NETSCALER FLAW, PATCH NOW
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Researchers have released proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for the
critical CitrixBleed2 vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler that can be
used to steal user session tokens. The vulnerability is caused by the
use of the sprints function along with a format string containing the
“%.*s” format string. Citrix denies active exploitation, but
security researcher Kevin Beaumont and ReliaQuest argue that they have
seen evidence of exploitation. 

 HUNTRESS AND MICROSOFT COLLABORATE TO STRENGTHEN CYBERSECURITY FOR
BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Huntress has announced a collaboration with Microsoft to help

integration with Huntress' EDR, ITDR, SIEM, and security awareness
training capabilities. The partnership addresses the gap where over
300 million organizations use Microsoft's ecosystem but struggle to
fully utilize available security features due to limited resources and
expertise. Huntress provides 24/7 SOC services to maximize the value
of existing Microsoft security investments, particularly targeting
businesses that lack in-house cybersecurity expertise.
