 CHINA-LINKED ESPIONAGE TOOLS USED IN RANSOMWARE ATTACKS (4 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 A China-linked threat actor, previously known for espionage
activities using the PlugX backdoor, conducted a ransomware attack
against a South Asian software company in late 2024, demanding up to
$2 million in ransom. The attack utilized the same toolset seen in
earlier espionage campaigns, including a malicious DLL sideloaded
through a legitimate Toshiba executable, which was linked to the
Fireant (aka Mustang Panda) espionage group. While several theories
were proposed for this unusual combination of espionage and ransomware
activity, Symantec notes that the most likely explanation is that an
individual actor was attempting to profit personally using their
employer's toolkit.
