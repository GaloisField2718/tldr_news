ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 3 MILLION IOS AND MACOS APPS WERE EXPOSED TO POTENT SUPPLY-CHAIN
ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 A group of researchers discovered 3 vulnerabilities in the CocoaPods
trunk server. The first vulnerability allows attackers to social
engineer pod developers by spoofing the XFH header when sending
developers an email for authentication to generate a link to an
attacker-controlled server. The second vulnerability allows attackers
to take over abandoned pods without proof of ownership. The third
vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code on trunk servers
with malicious MX records. 

 LATEST INTEL CPUS IMPACTED BY NEW INDIRECTOR SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACK (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers have discovered a new Branch Target Injection
vulnerability in Intel CPUs that could be used to steal sensitive
information. The attack has three components: the iBranch Locator uses
eviction-based techniques to identify the indices and tags of victim
branches and determine the Indirect Branch Predictor entries for them,
targeted injections are then performed against the prediction
structures to perform speculative code execution, and then an ASLR
bypass makes the prediction and manipulation of control flow of
protected processes easier. The researchers reported their findings to
Intel and recommended more aggressive use of the Indirect Branch
Protection Barrier and bolstering the Branch Prediction Unit design. 

 TWILIO CONFIRMS DATA BREACH AFTER HACKERS LEAK 33M AUTHY USER PHONE
NUMBERS (1 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The ShinyHunters hackers announced that they will leak 33M random
phone numbers associated with Authy. Twilio has confirmed the breach.
It reported that the vulnerability was due to an unauthenticated
endpoint and that no systems were compromised. Twilio has secured the
endpoint and is encouraging users to be vigilant for phishing and
smishing attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AMAZON DOCUMENTDB ANNOUNCES IAM DATABASE AUTHENTICATION (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Amazon DocumentDB has added support for authentication using IAM
users and role ARNs. Users and applications that connect to DocumentDB
clusters can now use an IAM identity to authenticate, allowing for a
passwordless experience. Clusters can also choose to allow both IAM
and password authentication if desired. 

 VULNERABILITIES IN COCOAPODS OPEN THE DOOR TO SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS
AGAINST THOUSANDS OF IOS AND MACOS APPLICATIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Evasec have found vulnerabilities in CocoaPods that
could let attackers insert malicious code into popular iOS and macOS
apps by claiming ownership of unclaimed pods. Developers using
CocoaPods should check their open source dependencies for security
risks, as these vulnerabilities could lead to supply chain attacks
affecting thousands of Apple device apps. CocoaPods has addressed the
vulnerabilities, but organizations should follow security steps to
protect their code from potential exploits. 

 THE RUNTIME SECRETS' SECURITY GAP (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post discusses a new solution that introduces encrypted
secret delivery directly into application memory to prevent exposure.
Secrets can be securely stored, delivered, and accessed without
compromising security using tools like tang, clevis, and latchy.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DECLARE YOUR AINDEPENDENCE: BLOCK AI BOTS, SCRAPERS, AND CRAWLERS
WITH A SINGLE CLICK (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Cloudflare has launched the ability for all accounts (including free
accounts) to block all AI bots, crawlers, and scrapers with a single
toggle under the Security -> Bots section. Cloudflare uses its global
bot detection ML model to categorize traffic as potentially bot
related. Under the new heuristic, traffic classified with a bot score
under 30 will be blocked automatically. 

 DNSTWIST (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DNSTwist lets you find lookalike domains that adversaries can use to
attack your domain. This can let you detect typosquatters, phishing
attacks, fraud, and brand impersonation. It can be useful as an
additional source of targeted threat intelligence. 

 FILELESS-ELF-EXEC (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 fileless-elf-exec is a Python script that generates interpreted code
which creates the supplied ELF as a file in memory and executes it.
This makes it possible to execute binaries without leaving traces on
the disk.

 INTRODUCING DOCS IN PROTON DRIVE (3 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Proton is introducing end-to-end encrypted document editing and
sharing to Proton Drive. The company states that all files, media,
metadata, and keystrokes are completely encrypted and cannot be
accessed by Proton or government surveillance (as it operates under
Swiss privacy laws). Proton has begun rolling the feature out and it
will be available to all users within the next few days. 

 NEW GOLANG-BASED ZERGECA BOTNET CAPABLE OF POWERFUL DDOS ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A new botnet named Zergeca can launch powerful DDoS attacks and has
advanced capabilities like proxying and reverse shell. It is written
in Golang and uses DNS-over-HTTPS for communication with its
command-and-control servers. The botnet has been actively targeting
countries like Canada, Germany, and the U.S. with various attack
methods. 

 MALLOX RANSOMWARE: LINUX VARIANT DECRYPTOR FOUND (10 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Mallox ransomware, which has been active since 2021, has evolved to
target Linux systems using custom Python scripts for payload delivery
and data exfiltration. The new variant employs AES-256 CBC encryption,
appends .lmallox to encrypted files, and utilizes a Flask-based web
panel for creating customized ransomware builds. Researchers have
discovered decryptors for several build IDs and provided methods for
detecting and hunting Mallox infrastructure using security tools like
Uptycs XDR and search engines such as FOFA and Censys.
