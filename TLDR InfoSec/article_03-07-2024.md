 MITIGATING SKELETON KEY, A NEW TYPE OF GENERATIVE AI JAILBREAK
TECHNIQUE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at Microsoft found a new generative AI jailbreak
technique to avoid guardrails in models. The Skeleton Key attack
involves asking the model to augment its behavior as opposed to
modifying it by having the model provide a warning before the blocked
content instead of refusing to produce it. This blog provides examples
of Skeleton Key prompts and some suggestions, such as output
filtering, to mitigate this attack.
