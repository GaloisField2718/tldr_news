 HOW PENTESTING MIRRORS THE EVOLUTION OF QUALITY ASSURANCE (6 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 A post in which Ross Haleliuk, best-selling author of the recently

observes that both QA and pentesting followed a similar trajectory,
going from companies not doing them at all before outsourcing the
functions, and then finally bringing them back in-house. He predicts
that just as software development and testing have become linked,
securing and testing software security will become the standard.
