ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CYBERCRIMS CLAIM RAID ON 28,000 RED HAT REPOS, SAY THEY HAVE
SENSITIVE CUSTOMER FILES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hackers from the Crimson Collective claim to have breached Red Hat's
private GitHub repositories, stealing 570GB of data, including
customer documents, security tokens, and certain details about major
organizations' IT environments. Red Hat hasn't confirmed the breach or
responded to extortion demands yet, but sample files are circulating
already. 

 766,000 IMPACTED BY DATA BREACH AT DEALERSHIP SOFTWARE PROVIDER
MOTILITY (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Motility Software Solutions suffered a ransomware attack that
impacted over 766,000 individuals and exposed sensitive data,
including Social Security and driver's license numbers. The company
detected the breach in August and notified authorities, offering one
year of identity protection to victims. Attackers claimed to have
stolen 4.3 terabytes of information, but there's no evidence of misuse
so far. 

 COMPANY THAT SELLS SPYWARE FOR MONITORING SEX OFFENDERS HACKED (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 RemoteCOM, a company that sells monitoring software for individuals
on parole and probation, was hacked. The attacker stole personal data
from ~7,000 parole officers and ~14,000 individuals whom the software
had monitored. The hacker indicated that the software was one of the
easiest they had hacked.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USING AWS CERTIFICATE MANAGER AS A COVERT EXFILTRATION MECHANISM (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) does not offer VPC endpoints, so any
cloud resources that want to utilize it must have access to the
service. An attacker can also connect an instance to ACM in the
attacker's account and use the nsComments field to exfiltrate
free-form data. The post concludes with an exploration of other AWS
services that can be used in this way, such as SAML provider metadata
and Lambda functions. 

 AWS CDK AND SAAS PROVIDER TAKEOVER (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AWS CDK requires users to bootstrap each environment, either manually
or via the 'cdk bootstrap' command, which creates the necessary roles.
These roles are configured by default to trust the current account's
root principal. This can lead to a vulnerability when a SaaS provider
requests an ARN from the user, which it provides to its proxy role to
load data from the user's account. If the user provides the SaaS
provider with an ARN from their own account, it will be implicitly
trusted, exposing the SaaS provider's environment to the user. 

 THAT INNOCENT PDF IS NOW A TROJAN HORSE FOR GMAIL ATTACKS (3 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The MatrixPDF toolkit exploits users' trust in PDF files by embedding
JavaScript and fake prompts to bypass Gmail's security filters and
automatically fetch malicious payloads from external sites. The attack
works through two methods: exploiting Gmail's preview function with
blurred content prompting users to "Open Secure Document," or using
PDF-embedded JavaScript that automatically connects to payload URLs
when opened in desktop readers. Security professionals should
implement robust attachment sandboxing, restrict personal email access
on corporate devices, deploy endpoint detection for suspicious file
behavior, and enhance security awareness training that emphasizes zero
trust for all file types, including PDFs.

 DATABRICKS ENTERS THE CYBERSECURITY ARENA WITH AN AI-DRIVEN PLATFORM
(4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Databricks launched "Data Intelligence for Cybersecurity," an
AI-driven platform that addresses the critical issue of security data
sprawl by unifying fragmented telemetry from multiple security tools
into a single governed foundation. The platform leverages Databricks'
Lakehouse architecture with "Agent Bricks" for building AI-powered
threat analysis agents, offering conversational dashboards and natural
language queries that early adopters, such as Arctic Wolf and Palo
Alto Networks, report have improved detection rates while reducing
costs. Security professionals should evaluate this platform as a
potential complement to existing SIEM tools, particularly for
organizations struggling with data fragmentation across multiple
security vendors. 

 ZANIA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [16] 

 Zania is an AI-powered GRC platform that uses autonomous,
domain-specific AI agents to automate security governance, risk, and
compliance tasks. Its agents continuously collect evidence, test
controls, assess vendors, evaluate internal risks, and accurately
answer vendor questionnaires, delivering end-to-end compliance
management.

 THAT ANNOYING SMS PHISH YOU JUST GOT MAY HAVE COME FROM A BOX LIKE
THIS (4 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Criminals have been utilizing vulnerable industrial cellular routers
to mass-send SMS phishing attacks ("smishing") since 2023. Security
researchers found over 18,000 of these devices, easily accessible due
to outdated firmware. These routers, mainly used for industrial
purposes, help spread phishing links across countries by exploiting
weak security or misconfigurations, making detection and shutdown
difficult. 

 HERE IS THE EMAIL CLOP ATTACKERS SENT TO ORACLE CUSTOMERS (3 MINUTE
READ) [19] 

 The Clop ransomware group sent extortion emails to Oracle E-Business
Suite customers claiming to have breached their systems and stolen
data, framing the attack as a business transaction while threatening
to publish stolen information if ransom demands aren't met. Oracle
confirmed awareness of the extortion emails and identified potential
exploitation of vulnerabilities addressed in their July 2025 critical
patch update, though researchers have not yet verified if actual
breaches occurred. Organizations should immediately apply Oracle's
July 2025 security patches, verify their patch status, monitor for
signs of compromise, and establish incident response procedures while
being cautious of emails sent from hundreds of compromised third-party
accounts used to bypass spam filters. 

 $20 YOLINK IOT GATEWAY VULNERABILITIES PUT HOME SECURITY AT RISK (2
MINUTE READ) [20] 

 Bishop Fox researchers discovered four critical zero-day
vulnerabilities in the $20 YoLink Smart Hub v0382 that allow remote
attackers to bypass authentication, intercept unencrypted credentials
and Wi-Fi passwords via MQTT, and remotely control other users'
devices, including smart locks, through predictable device IDs. The
vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-59449, CVE-2025-59448, CVE-2025-59451, and
CVE-2025-59452) affect the ESP32-based hub, which serves as a central
gateway for home security devices, potentially enabling physical
access to users' homes, as no patches are currently available from the
manufacturer, YoSmart. Security professionals should immediately
disconnect affected hubs from critical networks, avoid using them for
physical access control, implement network segmentation to isolate IoT
devices, and consider replacing them with vendors that provide regular
security updates until patches become available.
