 5 CRITICAL GOOGLE WORKSPACE SECURITY SETTINGS YOU MIGHT BE MISSING
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Set it and forget it? Not when it comes to securing Google Workspace.
Configuration drift, admin sprawl, and risky integrations creep in
over time, opening up security gaps that attackers love to exploit.
This checklist from Nudge Security [5] will help you catch common
mistakes and keep your security tight. 

For each security setting, we cover: 
- Common misconfigurations to look out for 
- Best practices for effective risk reduction

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HACKERS LEAK 5.1 MILLION PANERA BREAD RECORDS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Extortion group ShinyHunters stole roughly 14 million records from
Panera Bread by compromising a Microsoft Entra SSO code, then leaked a
760GB archive after failed ransom demands. The dump includes 5.1
million unique customer email addresses, along with names, addresses,
and phone numbers, creating significant downstream risk of phishing,
credential stuffing, and identity-based attacks that can extend far
beyond Panera's ecosystem. 

 NEW GLASSWORM ATTACK TARGETS MACOS VIA COMPROMISED OPENVSX EXTENSIONS
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at Socket Security identified a new set of compromised
packages on the OpenVSX marketplace that appear to be infected with
the GlassWorm malware. The malware targets macOS users and harvests
data from browsers, wallet extensions and wallet apps, macOS
keychains, Apple Notes databases, Safari cookies, developer secrets,
and documents from the local filesystem. The researchers note that the
extensions operated legitimately for two years prior to infection, so
it is possible that the developer was compromised. 

 RESEARCHER REVEALS EVIDENCE OF PRIVATE INSTAGRAM PROFILES LEAKING
PHOTOS (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A security researcher discovered a vulnerability in Instagram that
exposed links to private photos and captions in the HTML source code
of some private profiles. The researcher found that, in their testing,
28% of the accounts they created or had access to exhibited this
issue. Meta responded to the researcher, stating that the issue was
caused by a CDN caching problem and has been fixed, but the researcher
contends that it's a backend authorization issue.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW TO GET YOUR FIRST JOB IN CYBERSECURITY (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Job seekers looking to transition to cybersecurity should begin by
identifying the role that is right for them, finding a career mentor
to guide them, joining learning communities, and developing the
required skills. They should then build their online presence and
experience by volunteering with the security team at their current
job, telling their network about their career transition, building an
online portfolio, and polishing their LinkedIn profile. Finally, it's
time to apply for the job and prepare for interviews. 

 THE RISE OF MOLTBOOK SUGGESTS VIRAL AI PROMPTS MAY BE THE NEXT BIG
SECURITY THREAT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Self-replicating “prompt worms” are emerging as a serious
security risk as OpenClaw's autonomous AI agents interact on Moltbook,
install unvetted skills, and access private data. Researchers have
already found hidden prompt-injection attacks, leaked API keys, and
misconfigured databases that could allow attackers to silently execute
malicious instructions. With more capable local models coming, today's
OpenClaw ecosystem looks like a high-stakes dry run for much larger,
harder-to-stop AI agent outbreaks. 

 AUDITING OUTLINE: LESSONS FROM MANUAL VS AI SECURITY TESTING (10
MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This post shares results from a 60-day audit of Outline's open-source
wiki, uncovering seven vulnerabilities ranging from SSRF and CSRF to
insecure design and an IDOR in event logging. The authors highlight
strong baseline security in Outline's API design, but also note that
subtle framework behaviors and outdated dependencies led to real-world
issues, including a potential admin account takeover. One finding was
uniquely caught by an AI security platform, yet most AI-reported
issues were persuasive false positives that consumed 40 hours of
validation. The conclusion emphasizes that AI tools are promising
assistants, but human expertise remains essential for high‑quality
security reviews.

 GHOSTKATZ (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 GhostKatz extracts LSASS credentials directly from physical memory by
abusing signed vulnerable kernel drivers with `MmMapIoSpace` read
primitives, bypassing traditional user-mode detection mechanisms like
EDR hooks on LSASS. Designed as a modular Cobalt Strike BOF, it
currently ships with exploits for Toshiba TPwSav and TechPowerUp
ThrottleStop drivers and supports extensibility for custom driver
research via `utils.c`. Tested across Windows 10, Server 2012 R2
through 2022, the tool supports both logonpasswords and wdigest
credential dumping modes, though operators should note the inherent
BSOD risk when leveraging vulnerable kernel drivers in production
environments. 

 RAPIDFORT (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 RapidFort provides an automated software supply chain security
platform that analyzes and hardens containers, eliminates unused and
vulnerable components, and delivers curated, near-zero-CVE base images
to reduce attack surface before production deployment. 

 OPENMALLEABLEC2 (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 OpenMalleableC2 is a framework-agnostic library that implements
Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2 profile for HTTP transformations.

 WHATSAPP ENCRYPTION, A LAWSUIT, AND A LOT OF NOISE (14 MINUTE READ)
[15] 

 Cryptographer Matthew Green analyzes a class action lawsuit alleging
Meta can secretly read all WhatsApp messages, concluding the claims
lack solid evidence and that mass-scale decryption backdoors would be
detectable through reverse engineering of the closed-source client
app. While acknowledging legitimate privacy concerns around WhatsApp's
metadata collection, backup encryption complexity, and new AI-powered
"Private Processing" features, Green argues these known limitations
are far removed from the deliberate universal plaintext access alleged
in the complaint. Security professionals who remain uncomfortable
trusting WhatsApp's closed-source implementation are advised to use
Signal, which offers open-source code and reproducible builds for
independent verification. 

 DOCKER FIXES CRITICAL ASK GORDON AI FLAW ALLOWING CODE EXECUTION VIA
IMAGE METADATA (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Docker patched a critical “DockerDash” vulnerability in its Ask
Gordon AI assistant that allowed attackers to hide malicious
instructions in Docker image metadata labels, leading to remote code
execution and data theft via MCP tools. The flaw exploited
meta-context injection and breached trust boundaries among the AI, MCP
gateway, and local tools, and is fixed in Docker Desktop 4.50.0. 

 COUNTY PAYS $600K TO WRONGFULLY JAILED PEN TESTERS (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 In 2019, two Coalfire consultants, legally hired to test an Iowa
courthouse's security, were arrested for burglary after a county
sheriff overrode officers who had verified their contract. Their
prosecution dragged on for months, damaging careers and client
relationships, until Dallas County agreed to a $600,000 settlement
seven years later.
