ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 LOUIS VUITTON SUFFERS TWO HACKS IN A WEEK AS CUSTOMER DATA IS
ACCESSED IN UK AND KOREA (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Louis Vuitton suffered a cyberattack on July 2 that compromised the
personal data of UK customers, including names, contact details, and
purchase histories. Its Korean division was also targeted. This marks
the third LVMH breach in three months, following attacks on Christian
Dior Couture. No financial data was stolen, but experts warn the
luxury brand's high-net-worth clientele faces heightened risks. 

 VULNERABILITY IN END-OF-TRAIN AND HEAD-OF-TRAIN REMOTE LINKING
PROTOCOL (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CISA revealed a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-1727) in railroad
End-of-Train and Head-of-Train protocols that allows attackers to send
unauthorized brake commands via software-defined radio. Affecting all
U.S. rail industry versions, the vulnerability stems from weak BCH
checksum authentication that can disrupt operations or cause sudden
stops. The American Railroads are developing new systems, while
manufacturers like Hitachi Rail, Wabtec, and Siemens should adopt
network isolation and secure remote access controls. 

 PATCH IMMEDIATELY: CVE-2025-25257 POC ENABLES REMOTE CODE EXECUTION
ON FORTINET FORTIWEB (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A serious SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-25257) has been
identified in Fortinet FortiWeb. The flaw allows unauthenticated
attackers to execute remote code by writing malicious files to the
server's filesystem, potentially leading to full remote code
execution. Fortinet has issued patches for versions 7.6.4, 7.4.8,
7.2.11, and 7.0.11. Immediate application of these updates is strongly
recommended due to publicly available exploits.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FOOLING THE SANDBOX: A CHROME-ATIC ESCAPE (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The security researcher in this blog analyzes CVE-2024-30088, a
Windows kernel vulnerability that allows privilege escalation. They
successfully chained it to escape Chrome's renderer sandbox by
bypassing integrity level checks and job object restrictions. The
exploit overwrites security descriptors to gain system privileges,
then spawns a privileged shell with full control. 

 SCANNING FOR POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHIC SUPPORT (7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Anvil Secure's PQCscan is a free scanner that identifies SSH and TLS
servers supporting Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. The
tool scans for standardized PQC algorithms, such as X25519MLKEM768,
and generates HTML reports to help organizations prepare for mandatory
PQC compliance deadlines between 2030 and 2035. Available on GitHub
under a BSD license, it currently performs capability detection
without full handshake testing. 

 CYBERSECURITY (ANTI)PATTERNS: FRICTIONWARE (17 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Frictionware is security tooling that forces security teams to spend
more time onboarding the tool than focusing on generating results.
Some anti-patterns that lead to frictionware are: complex onboarding,
weak value proposition, and a lack of integration with existing tools.
Frictionware can be avoided by avoiding onboarding altogether,
focusing on build-in instead of opt-in, using forcing functions to
compel onboarding when required, and working within existing centers
of data and attention.

 LIBRARIES ARE UNDER-USED, LLMS MAKE THIS PROBLEM WORSE (2 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Libraries are underutilized in favor of custom code. This is due to
engineers preferring to write code rather than read documentation,
underestimating the problem, and organizations that reward complex
internal projects over using libraries. LLMs can further this issue by
rapidly generating code that is not as well-tested or understood as
the more well-known libraries.
