MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Landmark Admin, which provides back-office services to insurance
companies, disclosed a breach of over 800K people's data. Landmark
reported that it detected a suspicious attack on May 13 and
immediately took action to cut off access. The breached data includes
first and last names, Social Security numbers, tax identification
numbers, driver's license numbers, part numbers, financial account

 NEW WINDOWS DRIVER SIGNATURE BYPASS ALLOWS KERNEL ROOTKIT INSTALLS (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Attackers can bypass Windows security features and install rootkits
by downgrading kernel components. Outdated software components can be
introduced on fully patched systems by exploiting the Windows Update
process, making them susceptible to past vulnerabilities. Microsoft
has dismissed the issue and the vulnerability remains unfixed,
allowing for downgrade attacks and potential rootkit deployment.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HOW AWS USES ACTIVE DEFENSE TO HELP PROTECT CUSTOMERS FROM SECURITY
THREATS (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS' active defense tool, Sonaris, works in conjunction with MadPot
honeypot sensors to uncover new techniques that attackers are using to
attack customer accounts (such as enumerating S3 buckets or vulnerable
EC2 services) and attempts to proactively respond to them using other
AWS services such as WAF, VPC, and AWS Shield. Its use led to an 83%
reduction in abuse in MadPot tests. It was able to prevent more than
16k scanning attempts per hour during a Dota3 campaign in Q3 2024. 

 PASSWORD MANAGERS FOR SMALL & MIDSIZE BUSINESSES: ZATIK'S SAFETY BAR
RATING (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Zatik created a Safety Bar Rating to evaluate 5 password managers on
features such as MFA, SSO, RBAC, audit logs, force logout, password
complexity policies, encryption in transit, and support for data
destruction requests. Zatik found that BitWarden had all of the
features that it was testing for other than force logout and that
LastPass and 1Password supported all 9 features. Zatik recommends
distinct password managers over those in browsers or mobile devices
and they can be centrally managed. Zatik concludes by addressing the
LastPass hack by showcasing some of the efforts that LastPass has
taken to improve security since then.
