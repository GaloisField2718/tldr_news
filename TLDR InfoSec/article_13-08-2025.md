ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NETHERLANDS: CITRIX NETSCALER FLAW CVE-2025-6543 EXPLOITED TO BREACH
ORGS (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warns that a
critical Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (CVE-2025-6543) has been
actively exploited to breach critical organizations in the country.
The flaw allows attackers to compromise NetScaler appliances and gain
unauthorized access to organizational networks. Organizations using
Citrix NetScaler are urged to apply patches immediately to prevent
exploitation. 

 NORTH KOREAN KIMSUKY HACKERS EXPOSED IN ALLEGED DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Two hackers have breached the North Korean state-sponsored hacking
group Kimsuky and leaked 8.9GB of data. The data includes phishing
logs, data stolen from South Korea, phishing toolkits, unknown binary
archives and executables, Chrome history and configs, and Bash history
files. The hackers allegedly hacked Kimsuky for ideological reasons. 

 MANPOWER FRANCHISE DISCLOSES DATA THEFT AFTER RANSOMHUB POSTS ALLEGED
STOLEN DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Manpower is notifying 144,189 people of a data breach after attackers
accessed its network between December 29, 2024, and January 12, 2025.
RansomHub claims 500GB of data was stolen, including client and
corporate data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 I BUILT AN AI HACKER. IT FAILED SPECTACULARLY (8 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 In this post, the author talks about how they built an autonomous AI
pentester chaining tools like Nmap and Burp. It underperformed—few
real vulnerabilities, many false results, high costs, and slow runs.
Key lessons: LLMs plan well but evaluate poorly, autonomy drifts, and
human validation and hybrid AI-assisted workflows outperform pure
agentic hacking. 

 MAKING FILE ENCRYPTION FAST AND SECURE FOR TEAMS WITH ADVANCED KEY
MANAGEMENT (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Dropbox describes how it solved for Hardware Security Module
(HSM)-backed, team-based file encryption, where files are encrypted at
rest and access can be removed instantly while also prioritizing
usability at scale. End-to-end encryption would make it impossible for
Dropbox to offer file content search, and traditional team-based key
management, where a top-level key is used to derive unique keys for
each file, would be prohibitively slow due to Dropbox's file storage
architecture. To solve this problem, Dropbox introduced namespace
encryption keys, which are derived from an HSM-backed top-level key
and are used to derive team encryption keys. When sharing files,
Dropbox can temporarily share the namespace encryption key while it
reencrypts the blocks with team encryption keys. 

 PERSISTENT RISK: XZ UTILS BACKDOOR STILL LURKING IN DOCKER IMAGES (9
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Binarly warns that the XZ Utils backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) still lurks
in Debian-based Docker Hub images from March 11, 2024, propagating
into derivative images. It found 35+ affected tags, and the risk
persists via inherited bases and CI pipelines. Recommendations: avoid
those tags, rebuild from patched bases, and scan for the issue in your
images.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 BUILD A SMARTER SECURITY WORKFORCE (SPONSOR) [10] 

 High-performing teams start with high-impact training. See how
SANS-trained staff detect threats 4.2x faster and save millions
annually. Download the IDC white paper [10], sponsored by SANS, then
explore more SANS training and resources. [11] 

 GO GET 'EM: UPDATES TO VOLEXITY GOLANG TOOLING (4 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Volexity's GoStringExtractor is a plugin utility for IDA Pro and
Ghidra that helps analyze string data in Go binaries for reverse
engineering and detection purposes. The tool addresses challenges in
analyzing Go binaries where strings are stored in contiguous tables
without individual termination, and includes data from all linked
packages. This enhancement aids security researchers in better
understanding malware behavior and developing detection signatures for
Go-based threats. 

 CYATA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Cyata continuously scans desktop and SaaS environments for AI
identities and their permissions, and creates detailed audit trails of
their activity, including by requiring them to justify their reasoning
in real time.

 Verified Entity Identity Lock exposes hidden trust paths in your AWS
IAM setup before they become security risks.

 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES COORDINATED DISRUPTION ACTIONS AGAINST
BLACKSUIT (ROYAL) RANSOMWARE OPERATIONS (2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The Justice Department conducted coordinated disruption actions
against the BlackSuit (Royal) ransomware group on July 24, seizing
four servers and nine domains. Law enforcement also recovered
approximately $1 million in laundered proceeds from the ransomware
operations. This represents a significant enforcement action against
one of the active ransomware groups targeting organizations worldwide.


 HOW TOOL CALLING WORKS IN LLMS (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 LLMs use tools, external functions, or APIs when a user makes a
request that the model cannot fulfill given its internal knowledge
base. During inference, an LLM is provided with a series of tool
definitions as part of its input prompt or context window, much like
providing a human with a series of external functions and their
documentation. When the LLM detects that a tool must be called, it
ranks potential tools based on their relevance to the task and then
calls the appropriate tool to address the user's query. 

 MUDDYWATER'S DARKBIT RANSOMWARE CRACKED (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Cybersecurity firm Profero has cracked the Iranian-backed
MuddyWater's DarkBit ransomware, allowing clients to recover their
data without paying a ransom. Profero found that the key generation
method that DarkBit uses is weak and can be brute-forced. It also
discovered that VMDK files on ESXi servers are sparse, and much of the
content that its clients needed could be recovered without needing to
brute-force the decryption. Profero is not publicly releasing its
decryptor but urges victims to contact them.
