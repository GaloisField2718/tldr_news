STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 ACCESS AWS SERVICES PROGRAMMATICALLY USING TRUSTED IDENTITY
PROPAGATION (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS introduced trusted identity propagation to allow applications to
propagate a user's IdP identity to applications running in AWS to
access a subset of AWS services with SSO. Users can use the AWS CLI to
obtain an auth token from their IdP which then gets used by IAM
Identity Center to create an identity-enhanced IAM role session. This
blog post includes a tutorial on building and using the CLI
application to access data on S3 Access Grants, query Athena, and
programmatically interact with other AWS services. 

 GRAFANA LOKI AND UNINTENDED AWS DATA WRITE ATTEMPTS TO AMAZON S3
BUCKETS (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Grafana has announced that the ‚Äúunnamed open source project‚Äù
cited in the ‚ÄúHow an empty S3 bucket can make your AWS bill
explode‚Äù medium post was Grafana Loki. The author of the post used
the same name as the default bucket in the Loki Helm chart when he was
setting up the S3 bucket for his Loki installation, leading to other
Loki clusters deployed using the default configuration to attempt
writes to his bucket. Helm charts have been updated to not include
default names unless using local storage. AWS also announced changes
to S3 billing due to this bug. 

 APP-LEVEL EBPF APPLICATIONS - USER VS. KERNEL PROBES (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Leveraging eBPF technology allows for the detailed monitoring of
application performance and behavior in real-time without heavy
instrumentation. This post describes two main methods, user and kernel
probes, that offer different levels of visibility with varying impacts
on application performance. Kernel probes provide efficient insights
into applications without the performance overhead typically
associated with user probes.
