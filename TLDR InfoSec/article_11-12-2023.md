 NEW BLUETOOTH FLAWS LETS ATTACKERS TAKE OVER ANDROID, IOS, MACOS, AND
LINUX DEVICES (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Researchers have discovered a new flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-45866,
that allows for remote code execution on Android, iOS, macOS, and
Linux Devices. The attack deceives the target into thinking that
it‚Äôs connected to a Bluetooth keyboard by taking advantage of an
unauthenticated pairing mechanism that‚Äôs defined in the Bluetooth
specification. No specialized hardware is needed for the attack, which
allows attackers in Bluetooth proximity to inject keystrokes into a
vulnerable device. 

 STEALTHY LINUX ROOTKIT FOUND IN THE WILD AFTER GOING UNDETECTED FOR 2
YEARS (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Krasue is a Linux Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has been active
since 2020, primarily targeting organizations in Thailand. The malware
utilizes multiple embedded rootkits drawn from open-source code to
support different Linux kernel versions, a common technique for Linux
rootkits. Krasue leverages its rootkit capabilities to hook functions
like kill() system calls, network operations, and file listing to hide
malicious activity and evade detection.
