 HAS FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING HIT A DEAD END? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Traditional File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) often becomes shelfware.
Daily polling scans generate endless notifications without context —
and as an added bonus, they're so resource-intensive that you can't
actually run them in real time.

Is there a better way?

Cimcor's Definitive Guide to FIM [4] shows DevOps and SecOps teams how
to move beyond basic change detection to real-time System Integrity
Assurance. You'll learn:

 	* Why traditional FIM fails in modern environments
 	* How to monitor without creating noise [4]
 	* Real-time detection vs polling methodologies
 	* Change management and reconciliation workflows

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEW WORDPRESS MALWARE HIDES ON CHECKOUT PAGES AND IMITATES CLOUDFLARE
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The May 2025 WordPress Core malware campaign, discovered by
Wordfence, has three versions: one steals credit card data from
checkout pages while mimicking Cloudflare security screens, another
hijacks Google Ads and steals login credentials, and the third spreads
more malware by replacing website links. Since September 2023, all
have been disguised as legitimate plugins and employ advanced
anti-detection methods, including hosting management systems on
infected sites. 

 MAINLINE HEALTH, SELECT MEDICAL EACH DISCLOSE DATA BREACHES IMPACTING
100,000 PEOPLE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Two major healthcare data breaches have been disclosed. Mainline
Health Systems (Arkansas) suffered a ransomware attack by the Inc.
Ransom group in April 2024, affecting over 101,000 individuals with
stolen sensitive files. Select Medical Holdings (Pennsylvania) was
impacted by a vendor breach at Nationwide Recovery Services that
exposed nearly 120,000 people's data. 

 MILLIONS OF BROTHER PRINTERS HIT BY CRITICAL, UNPATCHABLE BUG (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Rapid7 discovered eight vulnerabilities that affect 748 printer
models from five vendors, with Brother accounting for 689 affected
devices. The critical flaw CVE-2024-51978 (CVSS 9.8), which allows
attackers to generate default admin passwords using device serial
numbers, cannot be firmware-patched. 

🧠 

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 FREQUENT REAUTH DOESN'T MAKE YOU MORE SECURE (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Low session expiration times frustrate users and don't effectively
improve security. Frequent reauthentication aims to prevent credential
theft, but if attackers have physical access, a screen lock suffices,
and if remote, expiration times are often too long to prevent
breaches. Instead, systems should reauthenticate only before sensitive
actions and use continuous verification like device checks and SCIM
controls. 

 LEAKING SECRETS IN THE AGE OF AI (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Researchers found that AI-related secrets dominate public code
repository leaks, comprising 4 of the top 5 vulnerable secret types.
The three main sources are Python notebook files, AI agent config
files, and new AI vendor secret types that scanners overlook. Valid
secrets from more than 30 companies, including Fortune 100 firms, were
found, highlighting poor AI development security practices. 

 VULNERABLE VS. EXPLOITABLE: WHY UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS
TO YOUR SECURITY POSTURE (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Horizon3.ai suggests security teams should prioritize
"exploitability" over "vulnerability," as many weaknesses can't be
exploited in real-world scenarios. Their NodeZero platform conducted
over 50,000 pentests in 2024, uncovering 765,000 critical exploitable
paths and showing attackers can gain domain admin access in 60 seconds
by chaining vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. They recommend
continuous autonomous testing rather than annual assessments, with 82%
of their customers now testing monthly compared to 26% of
organizations testing more than once yearly.

 Microsoft has announced a new method for consumers to enroll their
