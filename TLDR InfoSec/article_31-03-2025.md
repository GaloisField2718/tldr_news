 SECURE YOUR CLOUD WORKSPACE BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER A BREACH
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Your Google Workspace [5] or Microsoft 365 platform is where your
company works, communicates, and collaborates — it's your business's
critical infrastructure. Protecting it with a patchwork of native
security and point solutions leaves gaps – the biggest being
visibility _after_ an attacker has made it inside.

Material Security is purpose-built to protect the entire cloud
workspace – email, data, and accounts. With deep integration and
powerful automations, Material prevents and detects a wider range of
threats, responds to active attacks faster, and secures data and
accounts even after a breach. All within a platform that fits
seamlessly into existing workflows–making your security team's jobs
easier, and protecting your users without slowing them down.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 X HIT BY DATA LEAK OF 2.8 BILLION USERS; ALLEGEDLY AN INSIDER JOB (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A data leak on X, possibly due to a disgruntled employee, exposed
information from 2.87 billion users. The leaked data includes a wealth
of profile details but does not contain email addresses. Despite the
massive breach, X has not acknowledged the incident publicly. 

 SECURITY FIRM HACKS RANSOMWARE GANG, CRIPPLES OPERATIONS (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 After discovering a vulnerability on BlackLock's data leak site,
Resecurity researchers have been covertly acquiring information since
late 2024. The researchers exploited a Local File Inclusion
vulnerability to retrieve server-side configuration details and
credentials along with plain text server logs, SSH credentials, and
command-line histories. Resecurity researchers utilized their position
to warn law enforcement and potential victims before leaks occurred. 

 NEW UBUNTU LINUX SECURITY BYPASSES REQUIRE MANUAL MITIGATIONS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers at Qualys have discovered three new vulnerabilities in
Ubuntu 23.10 and 24.04 that could allow a local attacker to create
user namespaces with full administrative privileges. The bypass
mechanisms utilize aa-exec, busybox, or LD_PRELOAD. Canonical has
shared that they will be treating these vulnerabilities as limitations
of a defense-in-depth mechanism and shared recommended hardening steps
to address them.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TCCING IS BELIEVING (14 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Apple has added a new feature called Endpoint Security events for TCC
modifications in MacOS 15.4. Exposed with
ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_TCC_MODIFY flag, this feature allows security
tools to detect and possibly override user decisions on granting
access to protected resources. The events will provide information on
when a TCC permission is granted or revoked, helping users monitor and
control access to their system. 

 COMPROMISING THREAT ACTOR COMMUNICATIONS (12 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Many threat actors utilize Telegram bots as a method of establishing
C2 communication. In this technique, a threat actor creates a new
Telegram bot, embeds a token for the bot in their malware and deploys
it, then malware then periodically polls Telegram's servers to check
for new commands sent to the bot and executes any commands that are
sent while relaying the results back to the Telegram server. This post
deep dives into a case study in which a malware that was discovered on
VirusTotal was hijacked by the author, who discovered data from the
malware developer's system which they used for testing.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 LANDRUN (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 Use Linux Landlock to run any Linux process in a secure, unprivileged
sandbox. This tool is like firejail, but lightweight, user-friendly,
and baked into the kernel. 

 BRUTESPRAY (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Brutespray serves as a utility for executing password spraying
attacks by utilizing outputs from scanners like nmap or Nexpose. 

 GOLAPS (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 goLAPS is a tool to retrieve LAPS passwords from an Active Directory
domain.

MISCELLANEOUS

 BROWSER-NATIVE RANSOMWARE MAY BE THE NEXT BILLION-DOLLAR THREAT (3
MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Browser-native ransomware could target data stored in browsers,
bypassing traditional security measures. This type of ransomware is
hard to detect and can lead to severe consequences, such as
compromising email services and stealing sensitive company files. 

 PROTECTING ANDROID, WINDOWS, AND LINUX DEVICES AGAINST BEING TRACKED
VIA THE FIND MY NETWORK (5 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Malicious actors can track Android, Windows, or Linux devices through
an Apple Find My network vulnerability using malware that mimics
AirTag signals. They can monitor movements remotely, affecting
smartphones, computers, smart TVs, etc. Apple has issued patches, and
users should disable Bluetooth when not in use and keep devices
updated. 

 ZHOU SHUAI: A HACKER'S ROAD TO APT27 (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Zhou Shuai is a Chinese hacker that first started hacking in his
senior year of high school in 1996. Shuai's early motivations as a
founding member of Green Army were idealistic as he sought to be a
hacktivist vigilante. Shuai eventually ended up becoming more
commercial and less idealistic and is now designated as APT27 and
sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
