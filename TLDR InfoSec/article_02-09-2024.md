ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NGATE ANDROID MALWARE RELAYS NFC TRAFFIC TO STEAL CASH (19 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 A threat actor operating in Czechia evolved from utilizing PWAs and
WebAPKs to utilizing the NGate malware to attack Android users of
major Czech banks. The NGate malware is delivered via smishing, where
attackers alert users to either an issue in their banking app or a way
to get tax returns faster. The malware then utilizes NFCGate to relay
any NFC payments from the device, which allows the attackers to
duplicate the cards and withdraw money from an ATM. This attack does
not require the victim's device to be rooted. 

 RANSOMHUB HITS 210 VICTIMS IN JUST 6 MONTHS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 US agencies have issued a warning about RansomHub, a rapidly growing
ransomware group formed in February with at least 210 victims across
various sectors, including critical infrastructure. RansomHub exploits
vulnerabilities with common hacking tools. 

 CRITICAL FLAWS IN PROGRESS SOFTWARE WHATSUP GOLD EXPOSE SYSTEMS TO
FULL COMPROMISE (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Critical vulnerabilities in Progress Software's WhatsUp Gold, an
enterprise network monitoring solution, could allow full system
compromise. Over 1,200 internet-accessible instances may be affected
by CVE-2024-4885, a critical flaw allowing remote code execution. A
proof-of-concept is available.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EXPOSING SECURITY OBSERVABILITY GAPS IN AWS NATIVE SECURITY TOOLING
(9 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 SecurityRunners' Jonathan Walker provides an analysis of the coverage
of IAM Access Analyzer for detecting public or cross-account access to
resources. Walker puts coverage at about 65% and lists a few notable
gaps. AWS Glue and SES are fundamental services that Walker believes
should have coverage. Secrets Manager currently only alerts if a KMS
key and secret are public but Walker believes that it should alert on
just a public secret in case a method of accessing it becomes
apparent. Walker also notes that Elemental MediaStore certainly should
have coverage but is fairly obscure so may be a backlog item. He also
highly encourages deploying IAM Access Analyzer as it is simple to
manage and cost-effective. 

 UNPROTECTED CONTAINER REGISTRIES (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Unprotected container registries are easily detectable on the web
through tools like Shodan or scanning for common endpoints. This post
demonstrates the ease with which an attacker can locate an unprotected
container registry and upload or replace an existing image. The author
located over 10k unprotected registries across the full IP space and
was able to push a benign, PoC image to over 4,500 of them. They only
uploaded a dummy image under an easily detectable name due to ethical
considerations, but a motivated attacker could upload a malicious
image just as easily. 

 SET-TOP BOX RE: 6-PART SERIES (1 OF 6) (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog series examines the security of six set-top boxes to
determine if they're compromised or part of botnets. The research
involves hardware triage, filesystem extraction, and malware analysis.
It also explores how easily these devices could be exploited.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DALEC (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 Dalec provides a declarative format for building system packages and
containers from those packages. It is designed for building containers
for Azure and supports Azure Linux 2 and 3 and Windows containers. 

 UNIQKEY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [11] 

 Uniqkey's password and access management solution allows employees to
use mobile applications when logging into enterprise systems while
keeping passwords encrypted. 

 NETTACKER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information
gathering, vulnerability scanning, and eventually generating a report
for networks. It includes information on services, bugs,
vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other topics.

 ADVANCING THREAT INTELLIGENCE: JA4 FINGERPRINTS AND INTER-REQUEST
SIGNALS (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 JA3 Fingerprints were first introduced in 2017 as a method to
fingerprint browsers by taking a hash of the TLS ClientHello message,
but they have lost efficacy due to differences in how tools handle
various extensions and modern browsers scrambling TLS extensions. To
combat this, FoxIO introduced JA4, which introduces other protocol
elements into the fingerprint and is resilient to randomization of TLS
extensions by first sorting them before hashing. To make JA4
fingerprints more useful to customers, Cloudflare aggregates data
across its network on JA4 fingerprints into signals that can be used
in Workers and rules. This post includes a breakdown of the different
fields in a JA4 fingerprint, the statistics available via JA4 signals
for a fingerprint, and a script demonstrating how to utilize signals
in a Worker. 

 DON'T FORCE YOURSELF TO BECOME A BUG BOUNTY HUNTER (5 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Sam Curry, a hacker and bug bounty hunter, reflects on a common
mentality of setting up extensive goals and plans for getting into bug
bounty hunting. Curry compares this with his experience and failure
doing the same with his studies in high school. Ultimately, Curry
suggests that the fundamental issue in many hackers that set out these
goals and fail is that they aren't actually interested in bug bounty
hunting and should instead not force themselves to do it. 

 CITY OF COLUMBUS SUES MAN AFTER HE DISCLOSES SEVERITY OF RANSOMWARE
ATTACK (4 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 An Ohio judge has issued a restraining order against a security
researcher who contradicted Columbus officials' claims about a recent
ransomware attack. The researcher presented evidence that sensitive
data stolen in the attack was intact and accessible, contrary to the
mayor's statement. The city sued the researcher, claiming his actions
made dark web data publicly available.
