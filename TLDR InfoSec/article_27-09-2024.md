ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ONE-THIRD OF THE U.S. POPULATION'S BACKGROUND INFO IS NOW PUBLIC (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Cybernews has uncovered an Internet-accessible, passwordless database
belonging to MC2 Data, a background check firm. The 2.2TB database
contains information on over 100M US citizens as well as the data of
the 2.3M users who subscribed to MC2 Data. The exposed data includes
extensive personal information. 

 KASPERSKY DELETES ITSELF, INSTALLS ULTRAAV ANTIVIRUS WITHOUT WARNING
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Many Kaspersky users were shocked to discover that the antivirus
software was abruptly removed from their systems and replaced with
UltraAV and/or UltraVPN based on their plan. Kaspersky announced that
it would be shuttering its business in the U.S. due to a sales and
distribution ban. It informed customers via email on September 5 that
Pango Group, which owns UltraAV, would provide customers with
continued protection, but did not mention the forced installations. 

 FAKE WALLETCONNECT APP ON GOOGLE PLAY STEALS ANDROID USERS' CRYPTO (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A fake app called WallConnect mimicked the legitimate WalletConnect
project on Google Play, tricking over 10,000 users into downloading
it. Once installed, the app led users to a malicious website where
they were tricked into authorizing transactions, resulting in the
theft of sensitive wallet information and digital assets totaling over
$70,000 from 150 victims.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 CLOUDIMPOSER: EXECUTING CODE ON MILLIONS OF GOOGLE SERVERS WITH A
SINGLE MALICIOUS PACKAGE (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Tenable discovered a vulnerability affecting GCP Cloud Composer that
could allow for RCE via a dependency confusion attack. GCP suggests in
its documentation that customers utilize the --extra-index-url
argument when using PyPI packages from a private repository and
follows this guidance internally as well. Tenable researchers
discovered that when a package with the same name exists in a public
and private repository, pip will prioritize the higher versioned
package, whether private or public, and will prioritize the public
repository if the package is pinned. This allowed Tenable to identify
a package used by Cloud Composer that did not exist in the public PyPI
repository and create it themselves, which could have led to RCE if
used maliciously. Google has remediated the issue by switching to
using the --index-url argument. 

 GET TO KNOW AMAZON GUARDDUTY RUNTIME MONITORING FOR AMAZON EC2 (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Amazon has expanded GuardDuty's capabilities by adding a security
agent that can collect runtime metrics for EC2 instances. GuardDuty
uses the agent to monitor system commands and arguments and uses event
correlation to surface findings in 5 new finding types. AWS recommends
using these findings in an event-driven architecture to be able to
rapidly respond to findings and potential compromise. This blog post
walks through sample scenarios and details deployment strategies. 

 THE FIPS COMPLIANCE OF HKDF (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 HKDF is a key-derivation function used for cryptographic purposes
specified in RFC 5869. It can be FIPS-compliant for key-agreement and
general purposes with specific guidelines outlined in various NIST
standards. HKDF-Extract combines keys and data, while HKDF-Expand
serves as a general-purpose key-derivation function.
