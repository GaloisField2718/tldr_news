 80% OF ATTACKS TARGET THE END USER'S BROWSER - BUT IT'S THE LEAST
PROTECTED ATTACK SURFACE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The web browser is the most widely used enterprise application, but
one of the least protected ones. The rise of Highly Evasive Adaptive
Threats (HEAT), combined with AI usage, puts browsers in danger of
being breached at any moment.

With Menlo's browser security suite [4], you can let employees do
their jobs, with minimal disruption to their technology and workflows.

👉 Configure policies for local and secure cloud browsers

👉 Protect the user's local browser from zero-hour phishing,
infected files and browser exploits

👉 Secure access to enterprise web applications and sensitive data
