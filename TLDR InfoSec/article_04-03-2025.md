ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 INDIAN STOCK BROKER ANGEL ONE DISCLOSES DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Indian Stock Broker Angel One reported a data breach in its AWS
account, which was discovered through a dark web alert on February 27.
It changed passwords, launched an investigation, and assured clients
their funds and securities weren't affected. 

 SPYZIE STALKERWARE IS SPYING ON THOUSANDS OF ANDROID AND IPHONE USERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A phone surveillance operation called Spyzie has compromised more
than 500,000 Android devices and thousands of iPhones and iPads.
Spyzie suffered a breach due to a vulnerability that impacted the
Cocospy and Spyic stalkerware apps. The leaked data includes the
emails of Spyzie customers as well as data that was exfiltrated by the
apps. 

 ZAPIER SAYS SOMEONE BROKE INTO ITS CODE REPOSITORIES AND MAY HAVE
ACCESSED CUSTOMER DATA (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Zapier has informed customers that an unauthorized individual
accessed specific Zapier code repositories but that there was no
production infrastructure or data breach. Notably, the repositories
contained some customer data that was inadvertently copied for
debugging. Zapier stated that the attacker accessed the repositories
because of a 2FA misconfiguration on an employee's account.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 EARTH PRETA MIXES LEGITIMATE AND MALICIOUS COMPONENTS TO SIDESTEP
DETECTION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Trend Micro's Threat Hunting team analyzed a new technique from the
Earth Preta APT group, Earth Preta, and found that its attack chain
begins with the IRSetup.exe dropper, which drops a collection of
legitimate decoy files and malicious components and opens a decoy PDF.
In the background, the malware launches a legitimate EA Origin
application to sideload a modified variant of the TONESHELL backdoor
that injects shell code via Microsoft Application Virtualization
Injector (MAVInject.exe) if ESET anti-malware is detected or directly
into the processes if it is not. 

 THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME: EXPLOITING STATISTICAL WEAKNESSES IN HUMAN
INTERACTION ANTI-EVASIONS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Sandboxing is a common malware analysis technique that shifts the
burden of detection onto attackers who must detect that their malware
is executing in a sandbox and then evade malware detection.
Researchers from Check Point Research devised a sandbox evasion
technique in which their malware emulates a random mouse walk to
simulate a human and evade sandbox detection. Check Point Research has
provided an in-depth implementation of a counter-evasion algorithm to
detect this evasion. 

 OPEN SOURCE RESEARCH NOTEBOOKS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Research notebooks such as Jupyter enable open-source investigations
by simplifying code experimentation and data analysis. Platforms like
Google Colab, which hosts Jupyter Notebooks, offer easy accessibility,
security, and replicability for running notebooks online. Notebooks
provide a user-friendly way to interact with code, making them
valuable research tools.

 GOVERNMENTS CAN'T SEEM TO STOP ASKING FOR SECRET BACKDOORS (4 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 End-to-end encryption cannot be weakened for authorities without
compromising user security. UK and Sweden's anti-encryption
initiatives are misguided as criminals will use uncompromised options
such as Signal, and the answer lies in transparent, free open source
software, leaving fewer places for criminals to hide. 

 AS SKYPE SHUTS DOWN, ITS LEGACY IS END-TO-END ENCRYPTION FOR THE
MASSES (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Skype pioneered end-to-end encryption in communication apps,
promising unprecedented privacy. Despite governments worldwide finding
ways to circumvent this security—through hacking tools such as
FinFisher, China's surveillance enhancements, and later NSA
access—Skype's revolutionary approach to secure communications laid
the groundwork for today's encrypted messaging apps like Signal and
WhatsApp. 

 MODERN APPROACH TO ATTRIBUTING HACKTIVIST GROUPS (18 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Checkpoint Research has introduced a novel method for attributing
hacktivist groups by employing language-based machine learning models
and linguistic analysis to examine thousands of public messages. Its
technique integrates topic modeling to reveal key subjects discussed
by these groups and stylometric analysis to identify connections
between groups based on their writing styles. This strategy shows that
many state-sponsored entities disguise themselves as hacktivists, with
the analysis effectively linking various hacktivist personas to
individual operators and tracking how their focus shifts in response
to geopolitical events.
