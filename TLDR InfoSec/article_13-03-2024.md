 THE AWS S3 DENIAL OF WALLET AMPLIFICATION ATTACK (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 A novel attack method on AWS allows attackers to create a large
amount of RANGE requests for parts of large (>1GB) files before
quickly canceling the request. This bills owners for the full request,
which can result in a 50x cost amplification. This post discusses
defenses against this attack and why current remedies fail. 

 HOW BOTTLEROCKET OPTIMIZES EKS WORKLOADS (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A comparison of the available EKS optimized base OSes for security
and scalability. Amazon Linux 2023 provides consistent improvements
over Amazon Linux 2, but Bottlerocket, which was designed specifically
for container orchestration, trumps both. Bottlerocket provides strong
security defaults while providing a minimal host OS as it strips out
traditional tools like shells and interpreters that are not necessary
for container orchestration.
