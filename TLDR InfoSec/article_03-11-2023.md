TAKEOVER (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Researchers at VMware Carbon Black have discovered that 34 Windows
Driver Model (WDM) and Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) drivers are
vulnerable to exploitation by non-privileged actors who could gain
full control of the devices and execute arbitrary code. The technique
has been employed by various adversaries, including the North
Korea-linked Lazarus Group.

on package install. The attack chain is triggered by package
installation via an install hook in the package.json.

 POPPING BLISTERS FOR RESEARCH: AN OVERVIEW OF PAST PAYLOADS AND
EXPLORING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (13 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article provides an overview of Blister, a malware loader that
loads a payload embedded within it. The authors analyze past payloads
dropped by Blister loaders based on 137 unpacked samples from the past
year and a half and explore recent developments. The analysis shows
that Blister is mostly used in a targeted manner with Mythic agents as
its payload of choice. The article provides YARA rules and scripts to
help analyze the Mythic agent and the packer observed with it.

 .US HARBORS PROLIFIC MALICIOUS LINK SHORTENING SERVICE (5 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 Researchers at Infoblox have been tracking a three year old link
shortening service that caters to threat actors. Prior to May 2023,
the shortening service primarily used .info domains, but it has now
migrated to primarily using .US domains. The .US top-level domain
(TLD) is meant to be managed and verified by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, but researchers
have speculated that this management has been outsourced, leading to
the TLD hosting many phishing websites. 

 NORTH KOREAN HACKERS TARGETING CRYPTO EXPERTS WITH KANDYKORN MACOS
MALWARE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 North Korean state-sponsored hackers have targeted blockchain
engineers of an unnamed crypto exchange platform via Discord using
macOS malware named KANDYKORN. Security researchers have linked the
activity, which began in April 2023, to the Lazarus Group. The
attackers lured victims by impersonating blockchain engineers on a
public Discord server. The malware is a full-featured memory resident
RAT with built-in capabilities to enumerate files, run additional
malware, exfiltrate data, terminate processes, and run arbitrary
commands. 

 THIS TINY DEVICE (FLIPPER ZERO) IS SENDING UPDATED IPHONES INTO A
NEVER-ENDING DOS LOOP (4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A security researcher experienced a series of pop-up windows that
made it nearly impossible to use his iPhone while traveling by train
in the Netherlands. The culprit, it turned out, was using a Flipper
Zero device to send Bluetooth pairing requests to all iPhones within
radio range. This slim, lightweight device has been available since
2020, but in recent months, it has become much more visible.
