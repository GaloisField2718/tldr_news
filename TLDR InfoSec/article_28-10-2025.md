 SECURITY LOST THE BATTLE AGAINST VIBE CODING. WHAT COMES NEXT?
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 AI code editors now generate weeks of code in hours. Traditional
security crawls behind, creating backlogs that will never close.

But not all is lost...

Join CISOs and AI leaders from Nvidia, Salesforce, Glean, Augment, and
others at VibeSecCon [4]. This virtual summit will explore the death
of "Shift Left," the 10 critical anti-patterns in AI-generated code,
and the future of AI and security.

You'll also get a chance to experience VibeSec by OX [4] - a new
approach to prevent insecure code from ever being created by embedding
real-time, organization-specific context directly into AI coding
agents, at the moment of code creation.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 HOW WE BUILT AN EXPLOIT FOR SESSIONREAPER, CVE-2025-54236 IN MAGENTO
2 & ADOBE COMMERCE (20 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Pentest-Tools researchers developed a working exploit for
CVE-2025-54236 "SessionReaper," an unauthenticated vulnerability in
Magento 2's ServiceInputProcessor that allows customer account
takeover through session manipulation. The exploit leverages a
Magento\Customer\Model\Session\Proxy object's setCustomerId function
to inject arbitrary customer IDs into PHP sessions, enabling attackers
to impersonate any customer by crafting malicious session cookies.
Organizations should patch immediately and monitor for unauthorized
attempts to manipulate sessions targeting Magento installations. 

 DOMEWATCH LEAK EXPOSED PERSONAL DATA OF CAPITOL HILL APPLICANTS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A security researcher reported an unencrypted and
non-password-protected database containing PII of over 7,000
applicants to the research firm Safety Detectives. The data includes
names, phone numbers, email addresses, and security clearance status
or level. 469 records listed individuals with “top secret” federal
security clearance, which could expose those individuals to phishing
risks. 

 QNAP WARNS OF CRITICAL ASP.NET FLAW IN ITS WINDOWS BACKUP SOFTWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 QNAP issued a warning to customers to patch a critical ASP.NET Core
vulnerability that affects the company's NetBak PC Agent software for
backing up data to a QNAP NAS (Network Attached Storage). This
vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to gain
unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify server files, or perform
a denial-of-service on the device. QNAP recommends that users either
reinstall the NetBak PC Agent or manually update the ASP.NET Core
install on their PCs.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE LINUX BOOT PROCESS: FROM POWER BUTTON TO KERNEL (5 MINUTE READ)
[8] 

 This deep dive explains the Linux boot sequence from CPU reset
through various modes, including firmware handoffs, bootloader
operations, kernel decompression, and memory setup with paging. It
covers mode transitions, interrupt handling, GDT and IDT
configuration, and kASLR, which randomizes kernel memory locations to
prevent exploits. kASLR enhances security by randomizing kernel
addresses, but can be disabled with nokaslr for debugging. 

 SCAMMERS TRY TO TRICK LASTPASS USERS INTO GIVING UP CREDENTIALS BY
TELLING THEM THEY'RE DEAD (6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 CryptoChameleon cybercriminal group targets LastPass users with
phishing emails claiming "Legacy Request Opened (URGENT IF YOU ARE NOT
DECEASED)" that trick victims into entering master passwords on fake
sites by exploiting legacy access scenarios when family members
request deceased users' accounts. The campaign uses domain spoofing,
fabricated support case details, and phone calls to direct victims to
attacker-controlled URLs designed to harvest credentials for
cryptocurrency theft. Organizations should implement
phishing-resistant MFA for password managers, educate employees about
this specific "Legacy Request" subject line, and establish policies
requiring additional authentication factors beyond master passwords
for account access. 

 VIBECODING AND THE ILLUSION OF SECURITY (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 AI-powered coding, often called "vibecoding," claims to enable fast
and seemingly secure development of features like two-factor
authentication (2FA). However, this method often only creates the
illusion of security, missing essential protections such as rate
limiting and strong account lockout mechanisms. Attackers can easily
bypass superficial safeguards, especially if limits depend on factors
like IP addresses. Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate code
that appears convincing, but without clear guidance, critical security
measures are frequently overlooked or implemented incorrectly.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DOES YOUR IAM SYSTEM BREAK EVERY TIME SOMEONE CHANGES ROLES?
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Traditional IAM tools depend on static data and fall apart if an
employee switches departments or devices. Rippling's new IAM [11]
grounds identity in real-time employee data instead - enabling
automatic updates without manual provisioning or custom scripts. See
how it works in tomorrow's webinar [11]. Stay until the end for a
chance to win a $500 gift card! 

 PDF_OBJECT_HASHING (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 PDF Object Hash is a method for identifying similarities between PDFs
based on their structure rather than content, akin to imphash or ja3
hashes. It involves extracting object types and hashing them to
cluster similar documents and detect overlaps. Recent updates to the
parsing scripts improve accuracy, especially for irregular or
corrupted PDFs. 

 SPIDERFOOT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. It
integrates with just about every data source available and utilises a
range of methods for data analysis, making that data easy to navigate.


 IRREGULAR (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Irregular builds AI security labs to test the cybersecurity of
advanced models like ChatGPT and Claude. It develops tools, testing
methods, and scoring frameworks, collaborating with top AI companies
to ensure the secure and responsible deployment of AI.

 MEM3NT0 MORI – THE HACKING TEAM IS BACK! (15 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Kaspersky uncovered Operation ForumTroll, a sophisticated espionage
campaign using personalized phishing emails that exploit
CVE-2025-2783, a Chrome sandbox escape vulnerability affecting Windows
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) pseudo handles. The operation
deployed "Dante" spyware by Memento Labs, targeting Russian entities
through zero-day exploits and evasion techniques such as WebGPU
validation and COM hijacking. Security teams should monitor for Base64
folders in %LocalAppData%, enhance email filtering for personalized
phishing, and update Chrome to version 134.0.6998.177/178 or later to
mitigate the sandbox vulnerability. 

 FULL STUDENT DATABASE OF MOIS-AFFILIATED RAVIN ACADEMY LEAKED (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A comprehensive student database from Ravin Academy, a US
Treasury-designated MOIS front organization used to recruit cyber
operatives, has been leaked just days before its annual Tech Olympics
event in Tehran. The exposed records contain complete personal
information of trainees enrolled in what appears to be legitimate
cybersecurity education, but serves as a talent pipeline for Iranian
state-sponsored cyber operations against foreign governments and
domestic dissidents. Organizations should monitor for individuals with
Ravin Academy connections and note that the operational security
failure demonstrates vulnerabilities in Iranian intelligence
recruitment infrastructure. 

 YOU HAVE ONE WEEK TO OPT OUT OR BECOME FODDER FOR LINKEDIN AI
TRAINING (3 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 LinkedIn will soon collect public profile data from users in the EU,
UK, Canada, Switzerland, the EEA, and Hong Kong to train AI models and
share it with Microsoft affiliates for ad targeting. Users in these
regions have until October 27 to opt out, or their details—including
posts and activity—will be included, except for private messages.

 USB DRIVES ARE STILL A PROBLEM - BUT THEY'RE NOT YOUR ONLY DATA
EXFILTRATION RISK (SPONSOR) [18] 

 While most organizations focus on blocking USB devices, attackers and
insiders can just as easily steal data through network shares, cloud
storage, or even local folder access. You need visibility and control
over ALL storage access points.

ThreatLocker Storage Control [18] provides granular policies across
every storage type [18] - from USB drives to network shares to local
folders. Set policies as simple as "block all USBs" or as detailed as
"only allow backup apps to access the backup share."

⚡ Unified audit logs every file access with device serial numbers

⚡ 60-second approval workflow for storage access requests

⚡ Granular policies by user, time, application, and device type
