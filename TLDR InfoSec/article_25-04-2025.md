STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DESIGNING FOR SECURITY AND USABILITY: FIGMA'S MODERN ENDPOINT
STRATEGY (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Figma's security team developed an endpoint security strategy that
emphasizes device quarantine, allowlisting, and access controls for
improved usability and security. They implemented the Endpoint
Security Baseline (ESB) using OSQuery to identify security risks,
placing devices in quarantine if threats are detected until they can
be resolved. Figma also deployed Santa for application allowlisting
and Opal for just-in-time access to SaaS applications. 

 AUTOMATING AWS PRIVATE CA AUDIT REPORTS AND CERTIFICATE EXPIRATION
ALERTS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS Private CA is a service that allows an organization to issue
certificates via ACM without the need for a public certificate, which
may disclose sensitive services. However, certificates generated via
the console default to a 13-month validity period. In contrast,
certificates generated using the SDK or CLI are more flexible, but
they do not include certificate expiration notices. The solution in
this post leverages Lambda functions to periodically generate a report
of certificates and notify via email and Security Hub of any
certificates that are expiring within 30 days. 

 EVERYTHING TO KNOW ABOUT RUNTIME REACHABILITY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Runtime reachability enables security teams to prioritize
vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. It includes network
reachability, package-loaded reachability, and function execution
reachability. Package-loaded reachability may prioritize false
positives, while network reachability might de-prioritize
vulnerabilities in non-internet-accessible systems. Function execution
reachability is the most robust but requires a (C)ADR.

vector for breaches, surged over the past year, primarily due to
attackers exploiting zero-day exploits in edge devices and VPNs.
