 MFA MANDATES ALONE WON'T SOLVE IDENTITY SECURITY (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Earlier this year, Microsoft made MFA mandatory on all Azure logins -
but in an age of increasingly sophisticated attacks against
identities, this might not be enough.

Continuous Identity Security [4] looks beyond the scope of
authentication alone to incorporate both identity and device context.

Watch this recorded webinar by Cisco Duo [4] to learn how to:

 	* Easily protect Azure logins with strong forms of MFA.
 	* Keep access management streamlines so that the MFA mandate doesn't
frustrate end users and admins alike.
 	* Go beyond traditional MFA and build a robust identity security
program that includes Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) and
Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR).

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FAKE MICROSOFT OFFICE ADD-IN TOOLS PUSH MALWARE VIA SOURCEFORGE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Kaspersky researchers discovered a threat actor that is using a
SourceForge project page to host malware masquerading as the Microsoft
Office-Addin-Scripts project. The page prompts users to download a
password-protected zip file that contains an MSI file, which drops two
RAR archives and downloads a batch script from GitHub. The batch
script scans for antivirus and analysis tools, unpacks the archives,
and runs another batch script, which sets up persistence, C2, and runs
a cryptocurrency infostealer and crypto miner. 

 CENTRESTACK RCE EXPLOITED AS ZERO-DAY TO BREACH FILE SHARING SERVERS
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Gladinet has warned of a vulnerability in its CentreStack
file-sharing software that has been under active exploitation since
March. The vulnerability is a deserialization vulnerability stemming
from using a hardcoded machineKey. Galdinet has recommended that
customers apply patches immediately or rotate the machine keys if
immediate patching is not possible. 

 INCOMPLETE NVIDIA PATCH TO CVE-2024-0132 EXPOSES AI INFRASTRUCTURE
AND DATA TO CRITICAL RISKS (5 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 NVIDIA's patch for CVE-2024-0132 was incomplete, leaving AI
infrastructure vulnerable to attacks. Exploiting the vulnerabilities
could lead to data breaches and operational disruptions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 LINUX KERNEL RUST MODULE FOR ROOTKIT DETECTION (10 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Linux rootkits commonly share a set of capabilities such as hiding
itself, hiding data, offering a reverse root shell, and establishing
boot persistence. The author of this blog post discusses how to use
kprobe to detect LKM rootkit registration and inline hooking. They
also reflect on the process of writing an LKM in Rust during their
internship, noting the lack of abstractions but also appreciating the
safety guarantees of Rust as well as the typing and linting systems. 

 HACKING AWS LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - S3 FILE UPLOAD INJECTION (6 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 This post showcases the damage that a coding vulnerability in a
Lambda function can cause using the DVSA intentionally vulnerable app
as an example. The application includes a Lambda function that uploads
files attached to the feedback form, which is vulnerable to OS command
injection. This vulnerability can be used to extract the Lambda
function's IAM credentials, which provide full access to Lambda and
SES. 

 PCI DSS 4.0.1: A CYBERSECURITY BLUEPRINT BY THE INDUSTRY, FOR THE
INDUSTRY (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 PCI DSS 4.0.1, exemplifies successful industry-led cybersecurity
regulation by focusing on outcomes rather than methods. Unlike
government regulations that awkwardly combine business security with
user rights, PCI DSS was created by payment industry stakeholders
collaboratively addressing threats. This commentary dives into how
other existing and future regulations and frameworks can learn from
PCI.

 ANTHROPIC ANNOUNCES UPDATES ON SECURITY SAFEGUARDS FOR ITS AI MODELS
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Anthropic has announced new updates to its Responsible Scaling Policy
(RSP), which determines what level of model requires additional
protections. These models include those with the capacity to
potentially help a state actor develop chemical and biological weapons
or if a model could be used to fully automate the role of an
entry-level Anthropic researcher. Anthropic had announced in October
that it would begin sweeping physical offices for hidden devices and
implement other physical security measures. 

 MALAYSIA PM SAYS COUNTRY REJECTED $10 MILLION RANSOM DEMAND AFTER
AIRPORT OUTAGES (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 A cyberattack caused computer outages at Kuala Lumpur International
Airport in Malaysia back in March. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
refused the attackers' $10 million ransom demand. At the time, even
though officials claimed airport operations continued normally, photos
showed staff using whiteboards for flight information. 

 NIST TO IMPLEMENT 'DEFERRED' STATUS TO DATED VULNERABILITIES (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 NIST announced all CVEs published before January 1, 2018, will be
marked "deferred" in the National Vulnerability Database. This
administrative change helps prioritize newer vulnerabilities but
doesn't reduce the severity of older security flaws.
