ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CUPS: A CRITICAL 9.9 LINUX VULNERABILITY REVIEWED (3 MINUTE READ) [5]


 A critical Linux vulnerability in the Common UNIX Printing System
(CUPS) allows attackers to execute commands on a target computer via
malicious print jobs. The vulnerability requires specific conditions
to be exploited, such as enabling the cups-browsed service and having
access to the target server. Mitigation involves disabling
cups-browsed and blocking traffic to UDP port 631. 

 HPE ARUBA NETWORKING FIXES CRITICAL FLAWS IMPACTING ACCESS POINTS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 HPE Aruba Networking has fixed critical vulnerabilities in its Access
Points that allowed attackers to execute code remotely. Attackers
could exploit the flaws by sending specially crafted packets to the
PAPI UDP port. Admins are urged to install security updates to prevent
potential attacks, with workarounds available for temporary
protection. 

 OVER 90M FRENCH RECORDS EXPOSED (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Cybernews and another security researcher discovered an exposed
Elasticsearch instance containing 90M records on French citizens
(France has a population of 67.79M). The data seems to have been
collected by a data hoarder and comprises data from at least 17
breaches. The data contains full names, phone numbers, physical
addresses, email addresses, partial payment information, and other
data.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HACKING KIA: REMOTELY CONTROLLING CARS WITH JUST A LICENSE PLATE (33
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post describes in detail a vulnerability in Kia's remote
activation system that allowed an attacker to remotely control Kia
vehicles using just a license plate number. The attack flow involved
generating dealer tokens, retrieving victim information, and modifying
access to take control of the vehicle. While this vulnerability has
been fixed and the the hacking tool was never released or used
maliciously, similar vulnerabilities may be present in other
manufacturer's systems. 

 APPLYING SECURITY ENGINEERING TO MAKE PHISHING HARDER - A CASE STUDY
(7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Doyensec conducted a security review for a client's communication
platform to prevent phishing and social engineering attacks.
Vulnerabilities such as file extension bypass and subdomain crafting
were identified and addressed. Recommendations included removing
trailing dots in filenames and implementing stricter URL filtering to
enhance security. 

 CVE HUNTING MADE EASY (7 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 An automated process hunting for CVEs at scale across all WordPress
plugins resulted in 14 new CVEs over three afternoons of work. The
process involved downloading and cataloging all WordPress plugins,
then running Semgrep on any plugins with recent releases and at least
one install. Any findings were then manually reviewed and exploits
were attempted. A worked example of the process is included at the end
of the blog post.
