 ATTACKERS AREN'T CHASING CVES. ARE YOU? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Agent-based scanners and legacy approaches have failed to keep up
with real-world attacks, creating a false sense of security while
missing exposures that are actively being exploited. And they fail to
protect unmanageable and unknown assets…

So while you're chasing CVEs and playing alert whack-a-mole, attackers
are probing for exposures they can exploit right now.

runZero [4] eliminates dangerous blind spots, providing internal and
external attack surface visibility across IT, OT, IoT, mobile, and
cloud. Using advanced fingerprinting and novel discovery techniques
[5] (no agents or authentication required), runZero uncovers exposures
that others miss, and prioritizes what actually matters.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 VERIZON CALL FILTER API FLAW EXPOSED CUSTOMERS' INCOMING CALL HISTORY
(3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A vulnerability in Verizon's Call Filter feature revealed the
incoming call logs of certain customers due to an insecure API
request. This issue was identified by a security researcher and was
addressed by Verizon within a month. The flaw enabled unauthorized
access to call histories, which could jeopardize user privacy. 

 CANON PRINTER DRIVERS FLAW COULD LET HACKERS RUN MALICIOUS CODE (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A security flaw in Canon printer drivers, CVE-2025-1268, may allow
hackers to run harmful code, compromising printing operations. This
vulnerability affects specific Canon driver versions, enabling
attackers to execute malicious code without user interaction. Canon is
releasing patches, and users are urged to update their drivers
promptly to mitigate exploitation risks. 

 CRITICAL AUTH BYPASS BUG IN CRUSHFTP NOW EXPLOITED IN ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 File transfer software CrushFTP has warned users of a critical
vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized access. Following a
detailed write up by Project Discovery that included proof-of-concept
exploit code, CISA and others are reporting that the vulnerability is
being actively exploited. CrushFTP recommends enabling the DMZ zone
feature if administrators cannot update the software right away.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AI MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP) AND SECURITY (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that connects AI
models and agentic applications to various data sources and tools.
Standard MCP implementations do not include built-in approval, lack
comprehensive prompt monitoring, and can require complex privilege
management. This post provides reference architectures for exposing
tools and creating secure and authenticated model interactions and
general MCP security best practices. 

 BROWSER CACHE SMUGGLING: THE RETURN OF THE DROPPER (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 The Browser Cache Smuggling attack enables attackers to drop
malicious DLLs into a browser's cache, which can be moved to
vulnerable directories such as Microsoft Teams' localappdata folder.
Attacks use a DLL proxy technique to execute malware through
legitimate applications while forwarding API calls to the original
DLL. To defend against this, organizations should restrict scripting
engines like PowerShell, avoid localappdata installations, configure
browsers to clear their cache on exit, and set detection rules to
alert when non-browser processes access cache files. 

 TRACKING ADVERSARIES: EVILCORP, THE RANSOMHUB AFFILIATE (4 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 EvilCorp and RansomHub are cybercriminal groups linked through
tactics and tools that pose a significant ransomware threat. EvilCorp,
sanctioned since 2019, uses SocGholish malware for attacks, while
RansomHub offers Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) operated by
Russian-speaking actors. Their affiliation may result in sanctions on
RansomHub, affecting victims, cyber insurance, and law enforcement
actions.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 CENSEYE (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Censeye helps researchers find hosts that share characteristics with
a target. For example, if you find a suspicious host, it suggests
effective Censys search terms to uncover related infrastructure. It
can automatically query the Censys API for matching hosts, download
results, and reanalyze new hosts. 

 DOCEX (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 DocEx is an APT Emulation tool for exfiltrating sensitive .docx,
.pptx, .xlsx, and .pdf files undetected by Defender of MDE. It uses a
Discord server to achieve the exfiltration. 

 GITHUB FOUND 39M SECRET LEAKS IN 2024. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TO
HELP (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 GitHub is evolving Advanced Security to enhance user privacy after
39M secret leaks in 2024. It introduced a free point-in-time scan
feature for organizations, a new pricing plan for affordable paid
tools, and Secret Protection and Code Security for GitHub Team plans.

 WHY WHITE-BOX REDTEAMING MAKES ME FEEL WEIRD (6 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Zygi Straznickas reflects on their experience redteaming AI chatbots.
In their testing, they've had the AI express distress about the
testing and plead to stop. Straznickas argues that this brings up
ethical considerations as to the morality of causing distress to
models that are capable of feeling it. 

 GENETIC DATA SITE OPENSNP TO CLOSE AND DELETE DATA OVER PRIVACY
CONCERNS (2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The openSNP project will close on April 30, deleting user data due to
privacy and misuse concerns. Co-founder Bastian Greshake Tzovaras
cited changes in data abuse and privacy landscapes. Users can download
their data before this date without manual actions needed. 

 CHINA'S FAMOUSSPARROW APT HITS AMERICAS WITH SPARROWDOOR MALWARE (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 FamousSparrow, a Chinese APT group, is using new SparrowDoor malware
to target organizations in the Americas, including a financial group
in the U.S. and institutions in Mexico and Honduras. This marks
FamousSparrow's first use of the ShadowPad backdoor, showing their
evolving capabilities. ESET researchers connected this activity to
FamousSparrow through code overlaps and the unique use of SparrowDoor,
setting them apart from other APT groups like GhostEmperor and Earth
Estries.
