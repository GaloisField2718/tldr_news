 HOW LOVABLE, BLAND AI, AND 11X ARE CRUSHING COMPLIANCE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Is compliance the final boss standing between your startup and the
next big enterprise deal?

Hundreds of companies have found a solution that doesn't involve
chasing screenshots…

Delve AI [4] is the compliance agent that lives in your environment
and makes sure you're always audit-ready. It collects evidence, scans
your code, autofills security questionnaires, and keeps an eye on
who's accessing what.

And it's working: Bland got SOC 2 + $500K ARR in 7 days, Lovable got
there in 20 hours, and 11x unlocked $2.3M.

Ditch the slog. Get compliant the smart way. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CISA WARNS OF SUSPECTED BROADER SAAS ATTACKS EXPLOITING APP SECRETS
AND CLOUD MISCONFIGS (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Hackers broke into Commvault's cloud backup system and stole secret
passwords that let them access customers' Microsoft 365 accounts. The
attackers used a security flaw to sneak into the system. U.S.
cybersecurity officials are helping investigate and have advised
companies on how to protect themselves from similar attacks. 

 RANSOMWARE SCUM LEAKED NOVA SCOTIA POWER CUSTOMERS' INFO (3 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Nova Scotia Power confirmed a ransomware attack that started in March
affected 280,000 customers. Hackers stole personal data, including
names, addresses, billing details, and some bank account numbers, then
leaked it online. The power company refused to pay ransom and is
offering free credit monitoring to affected customers. 

 DATA-STEALING CHROME EXTENSIONS IMPERSONATE FORTINET, YOUTUBE, VPNS
(3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers at DomainTools identified a malware campaign that uses a
collection of over 100 malicious websites offering fake VPNs or
masquerading as legitimate services to trick users into installing
Chrome extensions. The extensions serve different malware variants,
such as info stealers and backdoors. DomainTools reported the
malicious extensions to Google Chrome, which removed some but not all
of them.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BADUSB ATTACK EXPLAINED: FROM PRINCIPLES TO PRACTICE AND DEFENSE (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This post dives into BadUSB, an attack method introduced in 2014
where hackers reprogram USB device firmware to disguise it as a
keyboard. When plugged in, the fake USB device automatically types
malicious commands into the computer. Antivirus software cannot detect
these attacks since they appear as legitimate keyboard input. 

 DISSECTING THE MACOS 'APPLEPROCESSHUB' STEALER: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF
A MULTI-STAGE ATTACK (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This analysis looks at the macOS "AppleProcessHub" stealer, which was
discovered on May 15. It appears as a dynamic library file
(libsystd.dylib) but is actually an executable written in Objective-C.
The malware employs AES-128 encryption to decrypt hardcoded strings
that form the command and control server URL (appleprocesshub[.]com),
then downloads and runs a bash script to steal sensitive data like
keychain passwords, SSH keys, shell history, and cryptocurrency
wallets. The stolen data is compressed and sent to the attacker's
server. The malware can run any script on the C2 infrastructure,
making it a versatile tool for data exfiltration targeted at macOS
users. 

 ROOT IN PROD: THE MOST IMPORTANT SECURITY ANALYSIS YOU WILL NEVER DO
ON YOUR AWS ACCOUNTS (16 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post explains how to identify all principals with
root-level access in AWS production environments, which organizations
rarely audit comprehensively. It provides code snippets to discover
AWS accounts, map IAM roles/users with administrative privileges,
analyze SSO permissions, and visualize trust relationships that allow
privilege escalation through role assumption chains. The analysis
reveals that production access often extends beyond intended
administrators to include CI/CD pipelines, forgotten legacy roles, and
external accounts through overly permissive trust policies, creating
massive attack surfaces that most organizations don't realize exist.
