ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NOTEPAD++ HIJACKED BY STATE-SPONSORED HACKERS (4 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Notepad++ confirmed that a suspected Chinese state-sponsored group
compromised its shared hosting provider from June through December
2025, selectively redirecting update traffic to serve malicious
installers by exploiting insufficient update verification controls.
The attackers maintained persistent access through stolen internal
service credentials even after losing direct server access in
September 2025. Notepad++ has since migrated hosting providers and
hardened its update mechanism with certificate and signature
verification in v8.8.9, with full XMLDSig enforcement expected in
v8.9.2. 

 WINDOWS MALWARE USES PULSAR RAT FOR LIVE CHATS WHILE STEALING DATA (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A newly discovered Windows malware campaign combines the Pulsar RAT
with Stealerv37, using Donut loader shellcode injection into
explorer.exe to operate entirely in memory while evading traditional
antivirus detection. The attack chain begins with an obfuscated batch
file in %APPDATA%\Microsoft that leverages PowerShell for fileless
execution, deploying capabilities including webcam/microphone
surveillance, clipboard hijacking for crypto wallet address swapping,
and credential theft from browsers, VPNs, and gaming platforms.
Notably, attackers actively engage victims via a live chat window
while simultaneously exfiltrating stolen data via Discord and
Telegram, maintaining persistence through a watchdog mechanism and
defensive evasion via Task Manager and UAC disabling. 

 1-CLICK RCE TO STEAL YOUR MOLTBOT DATA AND KEYS (CVE-2026-25253) (5
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A critical 1-click RCE vulnerability (CVE-2026-25253) discovered in
OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot), the popular open-source AI assistant with
over 100,000 users, chains three logic flaws: unsanitized `gatewayUrl`
query parameter acceptance, automatic gateway reconnection, and auth
token leakage in the WebSocket handshake. The exploit bypasses
localhost network restrictions via Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking due
to missing origin validation, then uses the stolen operator-scoped
token to programmatically disable user confirmation prompts and
container sandboxing before executing arbitrary commands on the host
machine. Organizations deploying OpenClaw should immediately upgrade
past v2026.1.24-1, rotate all auth tokens, and treat this as a broader
warning about the attack surface introduced by AI agents granted
extensive system permissions.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DISRUPTING THE WORLD'S LARGEST RESIDENTIAL PROXY NETWORK (11 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 Google Threat Intelligence Group disrupted the IPIDEA residential
proxy network—believed to be the world's largest—by taking legal
action against C2 domains, sharing intelligence with partners, and
enforcing removals of Google Play Protect, reducing the available
device pool by millions. The investigation revealed IPIDEA operated
through 14+ proxy and VPN brands with four SDK families (PacketSDK,
CastarSDK, HexSDK, and EarnSDK) sharing a two-tier C2 infrastructure
and approximately 7,400 Tier Two servers, with over 550 threat groups
from China, DPRK, Iran, and Russia observed using IPIDEA exit nodes in
a single week. Organizations should monitor for published IOCs, block
known IPIDEA-associated domains, and audit environments for traffic
patterns consistent with residential proxy abuse, particularly from
applications that monetize bandwidth. 

 YOUR PHONE SILENTLY SENDS GPS TO YOUR CARRIER — HERE'S HOW (8
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Mobile carriers can silently ask modern phones to compute and send
exact GPS coordinates using low-level RRLP and LPP protocols,
bypassing iOS and Android permission systems entirely. This happens in
the baseband processor, which talks directly to cell towers and the
GPS chip, so operating system privacy settings, VPNs, and app-level
toggles offer no protection. Law enforcement, intelligence agencies,
and even data brokers have leveraged this capability for real-time
tracking, often in murky legal territory. Apple's new C1 modem and iOS
26 add some visibility and consent controls on the iPhone 16e, but
billions of other devices remain always-trackable whenever a SIM is
active. 

 MACOS HARDENING: A NEW SERIES (9 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Gabriel Biondo, a former CISO and pentester, introduces a practical
macOS hardening series grounded in defense-in-depth principles,
emphasizing that layered security controls across network,
application, secrets, and operational layers dramatically reduce
compromise likelihood compared to any single control. The series
outlines a pragmatic threat modeling approach focused on identifying
assets, threat agents, and value-vs-cost tradeoffs rather than
over-engineered frameworks, with upcoming installments covering DNS
filtering, browser compartmentalization, MFA/passkeys, and
compensative controls. Security professionals are reminded that the
goal is not invulnerability but raising the cost of attack above that
of alternative targets while maintaining system usability.

 THE PATH TO PWNING THE PS VR2 (PART 1) - "RECOVERY MODE" (3 MINUTE
READ) [14] 

 A stack overflow vulnerability discovered in Sony's PS VR2
kernel-level USB authentication code allows arbitrary firmware
downgrading by exploiting an unchecked `memcpy` in
`usb_auth_set_auth1_data` that blindly trusts the USB request buffer
length beyond the 64-byte structure size. Repeatedly triggering the
overflow on device connection forces the PS VR2 into a hidden recovery
mode running initial firmware v01.10, from which any firmware version
can be installed despite no eFuse-based downgrade protection being
present. The exploit tool "vr2jb" has been publicly released.
Researchers recommend downgrading to v06.00 as a stepping stone toward
a full jailbreak that could unlock features like eye tracking and
haptics on PC. 

 STOPICE HACKED TO SEND ALARMING TEXT MESSAGES, ADMINS ACCUSE BORDER
PATROL AGENT OF SABOTAGE (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 ICE-reporting service StopICE was compromised to send frightening
texts falsely claiming user data was handed to authorities and
smearing its developer. StopICE's team traced the attack to a US
border agent's personal server. It says no usernames, addresses, or
GPS data are stored. The service will use “bait” data to identify
the alleged attackers. 

 BOOZ ALLEN TECH CONTRACTOR TOOK IRS JOB SPECIFICALLY TO LEAK TRUMP'S
TAX RECORDS (9 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The US Treasury Department announced that it was canceling all
contracts it holds with Booz Allen Hamilton after their failure to
prevent one of its contractors from stealing and leaking tax records
years ago. The decision specifically deals with the case of a
contractor, Charles Littlejohn, who leaked tax returns of more than
400k US taxpayers between 2018 and 2020. Littlejohn used a private
server to siphon the tax returns of President Donald Trump, Jeff
Bezos, Elon Musk, and other super-rich Americans.

 MCDONALD'S NETHERLANDS TAKES PASSWORDS TO THE STREETS FOR CHANGE YOUR
PASSWORD DAY (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 McDonald's Netherlands and TBWA\NEBOKO used digital billboards

full network access. 

 PLEASE DON'T FEED THE SCATTERED LAPSUS SHINYHUNTERS (5 MINUTE READ)
[19] 

 Unit 221B researchers warn that victims should refuse to pay or
negotiate with the Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) extortion
group, whose tactics include swatting executives, threatening
families, and manipulating media, as the Com-based gang's chaotic
internal dynamics mean they cannot be trusted to honor any promises to
delete stolen data.
