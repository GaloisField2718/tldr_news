 ATTACK PATHS DON'T TAKE THANKSGIVING OFF (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Misconfigurations and excessive privileges quietly chain together
into routes attackers can use to reach your critical assets — and
they aren't taking a Thanksgiving break. ATTACK PATH MANAGEMENT (APM)
shows identity risk the way adversaries see it, mapping relationships
across identities, systems, and permissions so you can prioritize what
truly matters.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RANSOMWARE ATTACK DISRUPTS LOCAL EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM ACROSS US (3
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A ransomware attack hit the OnSolve CodeRED emergency alert system,
affecting local agencies nationwide in the US and leading to a data
breach. Hackers accessed user data and encrypted systems, causing some
areas to lose emergency notification capabilities. Crisis24, a
platform provider, is transitioning agencies to a new system and has
advised users to change reused passwords. 

 HARVARD UNIVERSITY REVEALS DATA BREACH HITTING ALUMNI AND DONORS (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Harvard University suffered a data breach after a voice phishing
attack compromised its Alumni Affairs and Development systems.
Personal data like addresses, emails, and phone numbers of alumni,
donors, and students were exposed, though financial details and
passwords were not affected. Harvard is working with law enforcement.
It has warned affected individuals to watch out for phishing attempts.


 CHROME EXTENSION CAUGHT INJECTING HIDDEN SOLANA TRANSFER FEES INTO
RAYDIUM SWAPS (2 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 A malicious Chrome extension called "Crypto Copilot" (still
available, with 12 installs) silently injects hidden
SystemProgram.transfer instructions into Raydium DEX swaps, siphoning
0.0013 SOL minimum or 0.05% of trades over 2.6 SOL to a hardcoded
attacker wallet before users sign transactions. The extension uses
obfuscation via minification and variable renaming, communicates with
a fake backend at crypto-coplilot-dashboard.vercel[.]app, and
leverages legitimate services like DexScreener and Helius RPC to
appear trustworthy while bypassing Chrome Web Store review. Crypto
users should audit all transaction instructions before signing and
avoid installing browser extensions that request wallet access.
Security teams should monitor for wallet-draining extensions targeting
DeFi platforms.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 A COMPLETE GUIDE TO TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY (TLS) AUTHENTICATION (19
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This comprehensive guide covers TLS authentication fundamentals,
including the handshake process, certificate validation chain, and the
distinction between server-only authentication and mutual TLS (mTLS)
for high-security environments. Key recommendations include enforcing
TLS 1.3 (or 1.2 minimum), using forward secrecy cipher suites with
ECDHE, storing private keys in HSMs/KMS, and automating certificate
lifecycle management via the ACME protocol. For modern architectures,
the article emphasizes layering TLS with OAuth 2.0/OIDC for combined
machine and user authentication and leveraging service meshes such as
Istio for automated mTLS across microservices. 

 DESKTOP APPLICATION SECURITY STANDARD: INTRODUCING DASVS (6 MINUTE
READ) [11] 

 The Desktop Application Security Verification Standard (DASVS) is a
comprehensive framework for addressing the unique security challenges
of desktop applications across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Unlike web
or mobile apps, desktop applications operate with significant system
access, which demands specialized security controls. DASVS aims to
provide clear, actionable verification rules and is being extended
with guides and automated assessment tools to help organizations
strengthen desktop application protection. 

 ANDROID QUICK SHARE SUPPORT FOR AIRDROP: A SECURE APPROACH TO
CROSS-PLATFORM FILE SHARING (5 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Google enabled Quick Share interoperability with AirDrop starting
with Pixel 10, using Rust for the core communication layer to
eliminate memory-safety vulnerabilities in wireless protocol data
parsing—a historically common attack surface. The implementation
uses direct peer-to-peer connections without server routing. It
underwent internal threat modeling plus independent penetration
testing by NetSPI, and was validated as "notably stronger" than other
industry implementations with no information leakage. For
cross-platform development, Rust's compile-time memory safety
guarantees make it ideal for parsing untrusted data from external
sources, and Google's approach demonstrates how memory-safe languages
can secure interoperability layers between disparate platforms without
sacrificing performance.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 MALEFICENTVM (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 A practice VM designed for learning malware development through
CTF-style challenges. Exercises include OS enumeration, shellcode
injection into target processes, and IAT hooking techniques. 

 VIJIL (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Vijil helps organizations develop secure, reliable AI agents by
providing a platform for testing, hardening, and monitoring agents
against risks such as prompt injection. It offers modular agent
templates, compliance, and runtime protection for confidential
deployments. 

 XSSRECON (GITHUB REPO) [15] 

 XSSRecon is a powerful tool designed to help security researchers and
penetration testers identify reflected XSS vulnerabilities in web
applications. It automates testing URL parameters for the reflection
of a test payload and further checks how special characters are
handled.

 FBI: CYBERCRIMINALS STOLE $262M BY IMPERSONATING BANK SUPPORT TEAMS
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 The FBI reported over 5,100 account takeover complaints since
January, with attackers impersonating bank staff via calls, texts, and
emails to harvest credentials and MFA/OTP codes, then wiring funds to
cryptocurrency wallets. Attackers employed SEO poisoning to push
phishing sites mimicking financial institutions to the top of search
results. Some used dual-impersonation tactics to claim fraudulent
transactions and direct victims to fake law enforcement. Defenders
should train users to access banking sites via bookmarks rather than
search results, and organizations should monitor for brand
impersonation in search ads. 

 LIFETIME ACCESS TO AI-FOR-EVIL WORMGPT 4 COSTS JUST $220 (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 Malicious AI tools like WormGPT 4 and the free KawaiiGPT are making
it easier for cybercriminals to generate malware and phishing messages
and to automate parts of attacks. While the code requires some human
adjustment to evade detection, these "Dark LLMs" significantly lower
the barriers to entry for cyberattacks and social engineering. 

 CISA: SPYWARE AND RATS USED TO TARGET WHATSAPP AND SIGNAL USERS (2
MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Threat actors are using commercial spyware and remote access trojans
to target WhatsApp and Signal users. Attacks involve phishing,
malicious QR codes, and impersonated apps. They are focusing on
high-value individuals worldwide.

 TOR SWITCHES TO NEW COUNTER GALOIS ONION RELAY ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM
(3 MINUTE READ) [19] 

 Tor has replaced its old encryption algorithm with a new, stronger
one called Counter Galois Onion (CGO) to improve user security and
privacy. 

 MULTIPLE LONDON COUNCILS REPORT DISRUPTION AMID ONGOING CYBERATTACK
(2 MINUTE READ) [20] 

 A cyberattack has forced three London councils, Kensington and
Chelsea, Westminster, and Hammersmith & Fulham, to shut down networks
and activate emergency plans. 

 POPULAR FORGE LIBRARY GETS FIX FOR SIGNATURE VERIFICATION BYPASS FLAW
(2 MINUTE READ) [21] 

 CVE-2025-12816 is a high-severity ASN.1 validation flaw in node-forge
versions 1.3.1 and earlier (26M weekly NPM downloads) that allows
attackers to craft malformed data.
