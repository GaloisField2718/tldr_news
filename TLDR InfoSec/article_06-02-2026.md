ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL N8N FLAWS DISCLOSED ALONG WITH PUBLIC EXPLOITS (3 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 CVE-2026-25049 enables any authenticated n8n user with
workflow-editing permissions to escape the JavaScript sandbox via
incomplete AST-based sanitization, resulting in unrestricted RCE and
access to all stored credentials, API keys, and connected cloud
accounts. The flaws bypass the prior patch for CVE-2025-68613 via a
type confusion vulnerability in property access key validation, with
public PoC exploits now available and GreyNoise reporting 33,000+
probing requests against exposed n8n endpoints. Organizations should
immediately update to n8n versions 2.5.2 or 1.123.17, rotate the
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY and all stored credentials, and restrict workflow
editing to trusted users only. 

 CVE-2025-22225 IN VMWARE ESXI NOW USED IN ACTIVE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS
(3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CISA confirmed that ransomware gangs are actively exploiting
CVE-2025-22225 (CVSS 8.2), an arbitrary kernel write vulnerability in
VMware ESXi that enables sandbox escape from the VMX process, now
added to the KEV catalog as used in ransomware campaigns. Huntress
attributed a related exploit chain to Chinese-speaking threat actors
using the MAESTRO orchestrator toolkit, which chains CVE-2025-22224,
CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226 to achieve full VM escape and
deploy the VSOCKpuppet backdoor for persistent hypervisor control.
Organizations running unpatched ESXi should apply VMSA-2025-0004
immediately and audit for signs of unauthorized kernel driver loading
or VSOCK-based lateral movement from guest VMs. 

 DATA BREACH AT GOVTECH GIANT CONDUENT BALLOONS, AFFECTING MILLIONS
MORE AMERICANS (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A ransomware attack on Conduent in January 2025 exposed highly
sensitive data, including names, Social Security numbers, medical
details, and insurance information, for tens of millions of Americans
across multiple states. Conduent, which supports government healthcare
programs for over 100 million people, is still tallying victims and
slowly issuing breach notifications. It has offered few specifics
about the incident's full scale.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 AUTHENTICATION DOWNGRADE ATTACKS: DEEP DIVE INTO MFA BYPASS (11
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 IOActive demonstrated an authentication downgrade attack using
Cloudflare Workers as a transparent reverse proxy to intercept
Microsoft Entra ID login flows, modifying the JSON configuration and
injecting CSS to hide FIDO2/WebAuthn options and force victims to fall
back to phishable MFA methods, such as push notifications. The
technique leverages trusted CDN infrastructure with valid TLS
certificates and zero forensic footprint, enabling session token
capture (ESTSAUTH cookies) while authentication logs appear completely
legitimate. Organizations with "mixed mode" MFA policies should
enforce FIDO2-only Conditional Access rules without fallback methods
and alert when users unexpectedly switch from hardware keys to weaker
authentication factors. 

 HOW LLMS FEED YOUR RE HABIT: FOLLOWING THE USE-AFTER-FREE TRAIL IN
CLFS (15 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AI tools helped a security researcher track down a serious memory bug
in a Windows file system driver. By comparing an old and a new version
of the driver, the author identified a risky change and then used
timing tricks to trigger a bug in which freed memory is reused.
Connected to Ghidra, LLMs explained confusing functions, named
important structures, and highlighted where the bug lived, so the
researcher could focus on logic instead of wading through code. 

 HANDS ON WITH AWS BOTTLEROCKET: EVALUATING THE SECURITY OF AMAZON'S
HARDENED OS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS Bottlerocket is a hardened OS designed for running Kubernetes
nodes that includes several layers of protection, such as a read-only
root filesystem, an always-enabled, restrictive SELinux profile, no
package managers, language interpreters, or command shells, as well as
removing many other common privilege escalation tools. This article
compares an Ubuntu node and a Bottlerocket node with three common
container escape techniques and found that Bottlerocket prevented all
three of them, while they all succeeded on the Ubuntu node.

 NETTY ZERO-DAY CVE: SPOOFED EMAIL THAT STILL PASSES ALL THE CHECKS
(SPONSOR) [10] 

 Netty is everywhere in the Java ecosystem - used by Apple, Meta, and
Google among many others. Read about a business logic flaw around SMTP
that could enable attackers to bypass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, and how
depthfirst's security AI agent [11] flagged the issue and generated a
patch. Read the blog [10] 

 K8S-CUSTOM-DETECTIONS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 k8s-custom-detections provides a curated collection of Falco
detection rules, audit policies, and reproducible attack scripts for
identifying real-world Kubernetes attack techniques, including RBAC
abuse, service account token theft, CoreDNS manipulation, etcd
unauthorized access, and certificate forgery. The repository includes
ready-to-deploy lab setup scripts for Ubuntu 24.04 with Helm-based
Falco integration and individual test scenarios that simulate attacker
behavior against each detection category. Useful for security teams
building Kubernetes runtime detection capabilities or validating
existing monitoring coverage against common cluster compromise
techniques.

 AI-Powered Penetration Testing Framework with automated vulnerability
scanning, multi-agent system, and compliance reporting. 

 NULLIFY (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [14] 

 Nullify offers an AI workforce for product security that autonomously
detects, triages, validates, prioritizes, and remediates
vulnerabilities in codebases and cloud environments. It integrates
with tools like Jira, generates exploit proofs, and automates issue
fixes via merge-ready PRs, replacing manual security engineering.

 THREAT ACTORS HIJACK WEB TRAFFIC AFTER EXPLOITING REACT2SHELL
VULNERABILITY (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Datadog Security Labs observed threat actors exploiting the
React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) in React 19 server
components to pivot into NGINX web servers managed via Boato Panel,
deploying automated toolkits that modify configuration files to hijack
web traffic. Targets predominantly include Asian organizations across
.in, .id, .gov, and .edu domains, with attackers using compromised
servers for traffic fingerprinting, malware delivery, and credential
phishing via redirect pages. Defenders should monitor NGINX
configuration file integrity, ensure React server components are
patched, and audit web server access controls to detect unauthorized
configuration changes. 

 1.5 MILLION AI AGENTS ARE AT RISK OF GOING ROGUE (4 MINUTE READ) [16]


 A survey of 750 IT executives found that 53% of the estimated three
million AI agents deployed across US and UK enterprises are not
actively monitored or secured. 88% of respondents reported suspected
agent-related security or data privacy incidents in the past 12
months. Researchers warned that overprivileged agents operating with
broad credentials and persistent access represent a new insider threat
vector, with many organizations unable to even inventory how many
agents they have running. Security teams should implement continuous
runtime oversight, tiered access controls for AI agents, and agent
discovery capabilities to address governance gaps outpacing deployment
velocity. 

 SENATOR PRESSES AI TOY COMPANY ON CHILD DATA PRIVACY (2 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 Senator Maggie Hassan has shared a letter with bondu, a company that
makes AI conversational toys for children, about their data privacy
practices. This inquiry comes in the wake of a finding by security
researchers that bondu accidentally exposed chat transcripts and
personal data through a publicly accessible portal. Hassan's letter
specifically asks bondu who has access to the portal, what steps have
been taken to prevent future incidents, and whether AI coding
practices were used to develop the portal.
