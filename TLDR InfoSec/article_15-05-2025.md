ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CHIPMAKER PATCH TUESDAY: INTEL, AMD, ARM RESPOND TO NEW CPU ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Intel, AMD, and Arm have released security advisories on CPU
vulnerabilities, including a branch privilege injection issue
(CVE-2024-45332) that revives Spectre-BTI attacks on Intel processors.
Intel is issuing microcode updates for this vulnerability and others
identified by ETH Zurich and VU Amsterdam, which found three new
Spectre v2 attacks that undermine domain isolation. In total, Intel
patched 25 additional advisories for various high and medium-severity
vulnerabilities, while AMD addressed several high-severity flaws in
its Manageability Tools and CPU Libraries. 

 ICLICKER SITE HACK TARGETED STUDENTS WITH MALWARE VIA FAKE CAPTCHA (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 The website of iClicker, which provides a student engagement
platform, was compromised in a ClickFix attack. The attack prompted
users to click on a fake CAPTCHA, which copied a PowerShell command to
users' clipboards and then instructed them to run it. The PowerShell
script downloaded a legitimate Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable if
the script detected that it was in a malware sandbox or an unknown
malware that is possibly an infostealer if it was running on a regular
machine. 

 DIOR'S CHINA DATA BREACH EXPOSES ELITE CLIENTS (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Luxury brand Dior experienced a customer data breach in China that
exposed an undisclosed number of users' data. The stolen data included
customers' names, genders, phone numbers, email addresses, mailing
addresses, purchase amounts, and shopping preferences, but not
financial data. Chinese users have expressed an erosion of brand trust
on the Chinese social media site RedNote.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE CRYPTOGRAPHY BEHIND PASSKEYS (11 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Passkeys employ public-key cryptography for authentication. The
user's device creates a digital signature with a private key, while
the website verifies it using a public key, reducing password
vulnerabilities. WebAuthn provides vital anti-phishing protections
through origin binding, ensuring passkeys are functional only with
their respective websites. Different authenticator types balance
security and convenience. The passkey ecosystem supports cryptographic
extensions for functionalities such as key derivation and secure
storage. However, developers must implement account recovery
mechanisms, as lost passkeys cannot be reconstructed. 

 RUDE AWAKENING: UNMASKING SLEEP OBFUSCATION WITH TTTRACER (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Modern C2 implants will use sleep obfuscation where the implant
encrypts itself and stays dormant for a period of time before
decrypting itself, fetching and performing operations, and then
repeating the cycle by encrypting itself again. This makes detection
difficult because it is unlikely that an EDR will scan the system
while the implant is decrypted. This author explores how to utilize
Time Travel Debugging to detect when an implant decrypts itself and
makes network calls. They note that this method is very successful but
can be bypassed by malware authors by extending the sleep period to
make the manual analysis untenable or by unloading the attached
debugging DLL. 

 TALES FROM THE CLOUD TRENCHES: THE ATTACKER DOTH PERSIST TOO MUCH,
METHINKS (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Attackers leveraged a leaked AWS access key from an organization
management account to establish multiple persistence mechanisms,
including a "persistence-as-a-service" Lambda function triggered by
API Gateway that creates new IAM users on demand. Previously
unreported tactics included disabling trusted access for
organization-level services, manipulating AWS Identity Center (SSO) to
create backdoor users without MFA requirements, and operating from
Telegram IP addresses. The attackers implemented comprehensive
persistence strategies to survive credential revocation, demonstrating
sophisticated knowledge of AWS services and security mechanisms.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ENTRAFALCON (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 EntraFalcon is a PowerShell-based tool for pentesters, security
analysts, and sysadmins to evaluate the security of a Microsoft Entra
ID environment. 

 ONEIROMANCER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 oneiromancer is a reverse engineering assistant that uses a locally
running LLM fine-tuned for Hex-Rays pseudo-code to aid with code
analysis. It can analyze a function or a smaller code snippet to
return a high-level description of the code's actions, recommended
function names, and variable renaming suggestions. 

 SQLMAP AI ASSISTANT (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 An AI wrapper for SQLMap that simplifies SQL injection testing. It
features automated result analysis, step suggestions, and adaptive
testing with DBMS optimizations for MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and
PostgreSQL. It also includes adaptive WAF Bypass, which dynamically
selects tamper scripts based on WAF detection.

 THE IMPACT OF MICROSOFT'S REFS ON DFIR (32 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 This blog post provides an in-depth discussion of the new Microsoft
Resilient File System (ReFS) and details how it differs from NTFS from
a forensics perspective. It highlights the challenges during the
transitional period, such as a gap in tooling maturity, no Master File
Table, a lack of undo logs in ReFS' logging, changes in the Change
Journal, and various removed NTFS features. However, ReFS also offers
new forensics opportunities, including the ReFS Log and ‚ÄúFirst
Events,‚Äù the potential for carving opportunities in superblocks and
checkpoints, the potential for deleted data to persist if shared with
another file, integrity streams traces, and other metadata. 

 LEDGER SECURES DISCORD AFTER HACKER BOT TRIED TO STEAL SEED PHRASES
(2 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Hardware wallet provider Ledger notified users that it has secured
its Discord server following an attacker's compromise of a moderator's
account. The moderator's account was used to notify Discord members of
a bogus vulnerability that required users to verify their recovery
phrases with a scam link. Ledger reported that after some delays in
reporting the issue due to the compromised account muting and banning
other Ledger moderators, the compromised account was removed, and the
bot was deleted. 

 ONE-CLICK RCE IN ASUS'S PREINSTALLED DRIVER SOFTWARE (10 MINUTE READ)
[16] 

 The author found a serious security flaw in ASUS's DriverHub software
that could let hackers run code with admin rights. They explained how
the system could be tricked using subdomains and a silent install
trick. ASUS fixed the problem after it was reported, but credited
someone else.
