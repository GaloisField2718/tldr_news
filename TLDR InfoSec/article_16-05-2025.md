ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PERSONAL INFORMATION EXPOSED BY AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION
DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 The Australian Human Rights Commission reported that around 670
documents were accidentally made public, with at least 100 documents
accessed by search engines. The documents come from submissions to its
complaint form and feedback forms from the Speaking from Experience
Project, Human Rights Awards 2023 nominations, and the National
Anti-Racism Framework concept paper. The potentially impacted data
includes full names, email addresses, residential addresses, phone
numbers, employers and roles, work contact information, PHI, schooling
information, religion, and photographs. 

 OVER 3M RECORDS, INCLUDING PII OF STUDENT-ATHLETES AND COLLEGE
COACHES EXPOSED IN DATA BREACH (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Security researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered a publicly accessible,
unencrypted, and non-password-protected database belonging to
PrepHero, which is a platform to assist high school athletes with
securing scholarships. The database contained over 3M records that
included full names, phone numbers, physical addresses, and passport
data of students, as well as contacts of parents and college sports
coaches. Fowler also discovered a CSV file containing links to
passport images of student athletes and a mail archive that included
PII sent to coaches. 

 COINBASE DISCLOSED A DATA BREACH AFTER AN EXTORTION ATTEMPT (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Coinbase reported that rogue contractors stole data from less than 1%
of users and demanded a $20 million ransom. The breach included
personal and account information but did not affect passwords or
funds. Coinbase refused to pay and fired those involved. It is
starting to boost security and support to protect users.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WHAT IT TAKES TO DEFEND A CYBERSECURITY COMPANY FROM TODAY'S
ADVERSARIES (10 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Sentinel One details some of the threats it faces as a security
vendor. It has faced North Korean threat actors trying to infiltrate
its organization via workers, threat actors probing its network and
tools to develop bypasses, and Chinese state-sponsored threat actors
targeting supply chains that impact Sentinel One customers. Sentinel
One urges practitioners to distribute threat intel information across
operational stakeholders to expand detection, integrate context into
attribution activities, and expand supply chain threat monitoring. 

 COMMIT STOMPING (8 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Commit Stomping is a way to change Git commit timestamps to hide when
changes were made. This can make it hard to track who did what and
when, especially during audits or code reviews. To protect against it,
use signed commits, log events, and watch for unusual patterns. 

 FRESH FROM THE DOCKS: UNCOVERING 100,000 VALID SECRETS IN DOCKERHUB
(7 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 GitGuardian's analysis of 15 million DockerHub images revealed
100,000 valid secrets exposing databases, AWS infrastructures, GitHub
Enterprise instances, and Artifactory repositories. 97% were found in
image layers, with 60% created before 2024 and over 2,000 dating back
to 2020, showing secrets often go unrotated for years. Docker images
leak secrets due to build issues like persistent layers and build
argument leaks, making regular security audits essential, as
prevention is cheaper than responding to breaches.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GHOSTING-AMSI (GITHUB REPO) [10] 

 A PowerShell script that provides an AMSI Bypass via RPC Hijack,
which exploits the COM-level mechanics that AMSI uses when delegating
scan requests to antivirus providers. 

 PRACTICAL MALWARE DEVELOPMENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 A set of exercises and resources to learn about malware development. 

 KEVINTEL (WEBSITE) [12] 

 KEVIntel displays known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs) cataloged
from over 50 public sources, including CISA, and our private sensors
(once we get some hits). Each entry links to a CVE identifier,
enriched with EPSS scores, online mentions, scanner inclusion,
exploitation, and other metadata. The goal is to serve as an early
warning system, even before CISA publishes it.

MISCELLANEOUS

 CAN WE STOP DOCUMENTING OUR DETECTIONS? (11 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Documentation is important for detections to explain to SOC analysts
what the rule detects, how to investigate the alert, any necessary
enrichments, how to identify a false positive, and any necessary steps
if it is a true positive. This post compares documentation with rules
generated by LLMs to those written by humans using examples from
Elastic's open-source rule sets. The evaluation found that roughly 60%
of investigative steps provided by the LLM matched human-created ones,
but also noted that humans tended to provide a larger number of
detailed investigative steps. 

 THE IOS BOOK APP JUST OPENED ITS PAGES TO HACKERS (4 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 An iOS app called "My Book List" leaked personal data from 42,000
users due to poor security. Hackers could use this data for phishing
and targeted attacks. Experts found that many iOS apps make the same
mistake by exposing secret information in their code. 

 THE MOST EFFECTIVE PHISHING QR CODE IS A NEW DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
SUPPOSEDLY FROM HR (1 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Emails impersonating IT or HR departments trick the most users. Over
60% of deceptive emails reference internal teams, with nearly 50%
mentioning HR. The highest click rates were for subject lines like
“zoom clips” from managers and HR training reports, and warnings.
