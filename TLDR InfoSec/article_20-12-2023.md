 DELTA DENTAL OF CALIFORNIA DATA BREACH EXPOSED INFO OF 7 MILLION
PEOPLE (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Delta Dental of California and its affiliates are warning patients

 TERRAPIN ATTACKS CAN DOWNGRADE SECURITY OF OPENSSH CONNECTIONS (4
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A group of researchers have discovered a novel attack against SSH
connections that can downgrade the security of the connection by
truncating negotiation messages. The attack requires the attacker to
have established a man-in-the-middle position and the SSH connection
to be secured with either ChaCha20-Poly1305 or CBC with
Encrypt-then-MAC. The researchers have released a scanner to determine
if servers are vulnerable.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 HUNTING RANSOMWARE-ASSOCIATED PATTERNS: A KQL-BASED APPROACH (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 This blog explores a few advanced KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries
designed to identify and track known patterns, files, and other
Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) commonly associated with the Cactus
ransomware. 

 WTF IS ASPM? (5 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Application Security Posture Management is a new Gartner category
that refers to tools that provide everything needed to scan for and
remediate vulnerabilities in an application. Broadly speaking, an ASPM
should be able to track the lifecycle of a vulnerability, suggest
where in the code the vulnerability can be fixed, provide a robust set
of scanners, and allow for workflow creation. ASPMs typically include
a subset of the following scanners: SDLC, SCA, SAST, IaC, container
scanning, secret scanning, DAST, and CSPM.

 THE AGE OF WEAPONIZED LLMS IS HERE (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A researcher simulated using large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT to craft personalized spearphishing emails targeting UK
Parliament members. His paper reveals LLMs can iterate malicious
emails to successfully trick victims at a fraction of a cent per
message. The researcher's findings usher in an era of weaponized LLMs
posing immense new cyberthreats. 

 MALWARE LEVERAGING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE GITHUB ON THE RISE (14
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Threat actors exploit public services to conceal command and control
infrastructure amongst legitimate traffic. Blending malicious actions
through services like GitHub hinders threat detection and allows
inexpensive, reliable control of breached systems. This post navigates
how malicious actors are using this technology to frustrate incident
response and security teams.
