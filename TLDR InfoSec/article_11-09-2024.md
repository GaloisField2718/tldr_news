 SHRINK YOUR CLOUD ATTACK SURFACE BY 90% IN A FEW DAYS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Did you know less than 10% of cloud identities with sensitive cloud
permissions actually use them? Sonrai's Cloud Permissions Firewall [4]
tackles this head-on, by quickly identifying and quarantining these
‚Äúzombies‚Äù lurking in your AWS environment!

Within days, Cloud Permissions Firewall [4]:

 	* Restricts unused sensitive permissions and services
 	* Quarantines unused identities

permissions request through chat tools like Slack. Making requests and
approvals quick and painless. [4]

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 RED REAPER: BUILDING AN AI ESPIONAGE AGENT (10 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Inspired by the I-Soon leaks, these authors decided to build an AI
espionage agent called Red Reaper. Red Reaper consists of 3 data
science layers and a basic Flask UI. The first layer seeks to identify
entities that deal with LAW in the sample email dataset and assign a
confidence score to each one. The next layer builds a Neo4j graph and
performs some analysis on the graph to identify key communication
clusters and individuals. Generative AI is introduced in the last
layer to refine the analysis and identify information that could be
relevant for espionage, extortion, blackmail, or other criminal
activity. 

 SANITIZE YOUR C++ CONTAINERS: ASAN ANNOTATIONS STEP-BY-STEP (15
MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post discusses how to use AddressSanitizer(ASan) to detect
memory errors in C++ code. Adding ASan annotations to libc++
containers like std::string and std::deque aids in bug detection. The
post walks through various examples and code snippets that use ASan to
aid in finding memory bugs in C++ code. 

 DEPLOYING RUST IN EXISTING FIRMWARE CODEBASES (10 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 This blog post explains how to gradually introduce Rust into existing
firmware codebases for improved security. Drop-in Rust replacements
for C code can enhance security with minimal effort. By following an
incremental approach and addressing specific challenges, you can
seamlessly integrate Rust into your firmware development process.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 KUBERNETES TESTING ENVIRONMENT: AN OPEN SOURCE RESILIENCE PLATFORM
FOR EKS, GKE, AND AKS (8 MINUTE READ) [12] 

 Orca has released a new tool for testing managed Kubernetes
environments. The Kubernetes Testing Environment uses Terraform to
deploy a configurable staging environment and runs a configurable set
of scans against it. It provides dashboards to visualize the scan
results. 

 FRIDA 16.5.0 RELEASED (4 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Frida 16.5.0 contains new features like hardware breakpoints and
watchpoints to help locate code accessing specific memory data more
easily. The release also brings support for Windows on ARM and other
improvements, making Frida even more versatile for developers. This
article presents a demo using these new APIs in a game like DOOM,
showing how to find and monitor memory locations dynamically. 

 HOOKCHAIN (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 hookchain aims to provide a new perspective on EDR Evasion. Through a
precise combination of IAT Hooking techniques, dynamic SSN resolution,
and indirect system calls, hookchain redirects the execution flow of
Windows subsystems in a way that remains invisible to the vigilant
eyes of EDRs that only act on Ntdll.dll without requiring changes to
the source code of the applications and malware involved.

 MAKING SENSE OF THE APPLICATION SECURITY PRODUCT MARKET (17 MINUTE
READ) [15] 

 The AppSec product market is undergoing rapid change as new tooling
such as CSPMs and API security tools shift the way teams interact with
traditional tools like WAFs and DASTs. ASPMs are arriving to bridge
the UI/UX and contextual gaps that exist in AppSec tools across the
SDLC but struggle with requiring more integration points than CSPMs.
GenAI is emerging as a useful tool that aids in triaging alerts, but
it is still lacking in maturity. 

 BUG LEFT SOME WINDOWS PCS DANGEROUSLY UNPATCHED (3 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Microsoft has released updates to fix 79 security vulnerabilities in
Windows, including an unpatched bug affecting some Windows 10 PCs. One

Windows 10 systems. Two zero-day flaws affecting Microsoft Publisher
and Office, CVE-2024-38226 and CVE-2024-38217, were disclosed.
