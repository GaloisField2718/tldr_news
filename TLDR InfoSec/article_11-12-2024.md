 GETTING PROACTIVE ABOUT VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 If your vulnerability management only kicks into action after the bad
thing has happened, it's not good enough. You need to find and plug
vulnerabilities before they can be exploited to deploy ransomware,
infostealers, and other threats.

Learn how you can build a strong vulnerability management program
(VMP) [4] and reduce your attack surface with this comprehensive guide
by Flashpoint [4].

This guide offers proven strategies such as targeted prioritization,
and meaningful ways to track your success in terms of MTTD / MTTR.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ANNA JACQUES HOSPITAL RANSOMWARE BREACH EXPOSED 300K PATIENTS (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Anna Jacques suffered a data breach towards the end of 2023 that led
to the publication of the breached data in early 2024. The hospital
concluded a manual review of the breached data in November 2024 and
has notified the over 300K individuals who were affected. The exposed
information includes demographic information, medical history, health
insurance information, SSNs, driver's license numbers, and financial
information. 

 SENIOR DATING DATA BREACH EXPOSES MORE THAN 700K USERS (1 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 A data breach at the app Senior Dating has exposed the data of over
700K users. The owner of the site acknowledged the breach as well as a
breach on Ladies.com which affected over 100K users in an email
announcing the closing of both apps. The breached data includes bios,
dates of birth, drinking habits, education levels, email addresses,
genders, geographic locations, occupations, profile photos,
relationship statuses, smoking habits, and social media profiles. 

 WPFORMS BUG ALLOWS STRIPE REFUNDS ON MILLIONS OF WORDPRESS SITES (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 A bug in WPForms allows users to issue Stripe refunds on over 6
million WordPress sites. The vulnerability was categorized as
high-severity and a patch has been released in version 1.9.2.2.
Website owners are advised to update to the latest version to prevent
potential revenue loss and business disruption.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE DARK SIDE OF DOMAIN-SPECIFIC LANGUAGES: UNCOVERING NEW ATTACK
TECHNIQUES IN OPA AND TERRAFORM (14 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers from Tenable investigated the OPA policy-as-code language
and the Terraform infrastructure-as-code language and discovered new
attack techniques. When investigating OPA they found that data can be
exfiltrated from IMDSv2 using the http.send function in Rego or via
DNS tunneling if http.send is disabled. In Terraform, the team
explored some known weaknesses in Terraform plans such as usage of the
external, HTTP, or external data source as well as the local-exec and
remote-exec provisioners. Tenable suggests only using trusted modules
and policies, setting up cloud and application logging, limiting
network access, and scanning to mitigate these risks. 

 CROSS-IDP IMPERSONATION: HIJACKING SSO TO ACCESS DOWNSTREAM APPS (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cross-IdP impersonation is an attack in which an attacker signs up
for an account on an app that can function as an IdP and links it to
the employee's company email address via a “use existing email”
option. The attacker then either bypasses verification or verifies the
domain by clicking a link in the email (or socially engineering an
employee to click the link). The attacker can then sign into
downstream apps by using the “sign in with” option with their
impersonated IdP. Application protections against this attack vary
significantly so Push Security suggests that companies alert on
activation links to employee's emails, warn users of the risks
associated with phishing, where possible configure SaaS apps to
require reauthentication to add a new IdP, and where possible prevent
the conversion of a personal account to a corporate account. 

 INSIDE ZLOADER'S LATEST TRICK: DNS TUNNELING (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Zloader, a malware originally designed for banking trojans, has
evolved into a sophisticated ransomware deployment tool. It now uses
DNS tunneling, anti-analysis capabilities, and an interactive shell.
Zloader attacks have become more targeted, and the malware has been
updated with new features to evade detection. A specific variant,
"BB3", is linked to Black Basta ransomware operations. Zloader's
authors are focused on making the malware more resilient against
security controls.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 HOW TO PREVENT OVERPRIVILEGED DEVELOPER ACCESS FROM LEAVING
ORGANIZATIONS VULNERABLE (SPONSOR) [11] 

 Developers need privileged access to cloud resources without getting
bogged down by complex processes. Security teams need some level of
oversight and control. ZERO STANDING PRIVILEGES (ZSP) help both teams
strike the right balance. Get the CyberArk whitepaper [12] to learn
how security teams can minimize risk by controlling time,
entitlements, and approvals with ZSP. Download now [12]

 Vmi (Virtual Machine Introspection) is a Rust library that provides
safe abstractions for analyzing and manipulating virtual machine state
from outside.

 I BOUGHT US-EAST-1.COM: A LOOK AT SECURITY, DNS TRAFFIC, AND
PROTECTING AWS USERS (6 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 In 2021, Gabriel Koo noticed that the us-east-1.com domain was
available and purchased it to prevent potential phishing. The most
frequent DNS query that Koo observed was to a presumably production
database (prod-backend-db.randomHash.us-east-1.com). Other top queries
were to a loopback streaming service, a Cisco static file reputation
host, and various cloud storage services. Koo encourages users to
utilize tools like Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to prevent possible
typos like this one. 

 WHAT SUCKS IN SECURITY? RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM 50+ SECURITY LEADERS
(15 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 In this article, Maya Kaczorowski distills lessons from interviews
from 57 security leaders and discovers that the top three pain points
in security are access management (overwhelmed by access request
tickets), vulnerability management (struggling with too many
vulnerabilities to patch), and SaaS logs (difficulty accessing and
analyzing logs during incidents). Beyond technical issues, cultural
complications like vendor sprawl, unclear ownership of assets, and
challenges in communicating security risks make these problems even
more difficult to address. While there's excitement about AI improving
security tooling, many core security challenges remain fundamentally
unchanged, with few true breakthrough innovations that have eliminated
entire classes of security issues.
