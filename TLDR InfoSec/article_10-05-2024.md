 LLM PENTEST: LEVERAGING AGENT INTEGRATION FOR RCE (7 MINUTE READ) [8]


 This blog post discusses how vulnerabilities like "Prompt Leaking"
were exploited during an LLM pentest, enabling unauthorized execution
of system commands via Python code injection. By manipulating the
assistant's responses, attackers were able to extract sensitive
information and even execute code, demonstrating the risks of
integrating LLMs without proper security measures. Understanding these
attack vectors can help prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

 EVERYDAY GHIDRA: SYMBOLS ‚Äî PRESCRIPTION LENSES FOR REVERSE
ENGINEERS ‚Äî PART 1 (5 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This blog post discusses the use of symbols in Ghidra for reverse

code by providing human-readable identifiers like function names,
prototypes, and data types. This aids in transforming obscure assembly
code into more understandable formats, similar to high-level
programming languages. The post explains how symbols are extracted
from binary exports and imports and their significance in making the
reverse engineering process more intuitive and efficient.
