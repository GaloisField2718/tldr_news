 WHEN YOUR CEO CALLS, WILL YOU KNOW IT'S REAL? (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Phishing has gone beyond email. Today's attackers use AI-generated
voices, videos, and interactive deepfakes of company executives. They
can fool almost anyone - including you and your coworkers.

Backed by $55M+ IN FUNDING FROM OPENAI AND A16Z, Adaptive Security is
the first security awareness platform built to stop AI-powered social
engineering [4]. Adaptive keeps employees on their feet with tools
such as:

 	* Deepfake phishing simulations of company executives in real-world
attack scenarios
 	* Interactive, customizable training content tailored for each
employee (500+ resources)
 	* AI-driven risk scoring that factors in your publicly available
data adversaries can exploit

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 POLAND HIT BY ANOTHER MAJOR CYBERATTACK AS HACKERS STEAL USERS' DATA
FROM LOAN PLATFORM (2 MINUTE READ) 

 Polish authorities are investigating a large-scale cyberattack that
compromised personal data belonging to clients of the SuperGrosz
online loan platform. Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Gawkowski
reported that the attackers stole names, national identification
numbers, ID card details, email and home addresses, phone numbers,
nationality, bank account numbers, and other sensitive personal
information. Affected users are advised to exercise caution, change
passwords, enable 2FA, and use the government's mobile app to block
their national identification number. 

 CISA: HIGH-SEVERITY LINUX FLAW NOW EXPLOITED BY RANSOMWARE GANGS (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 CISA has added a 2024 use-after-free vulnerability to the known
exploited vulnerabilities (KEV) list after it was observed being
exploited by ransomware gangs. The vulnerability results from a
decade-old flaw in the netfilter:nf_tables kernel component and can be
abused by local attackers to escalate privileges to root. 

 ANDROID APPS MISUSING NFC AND HCE TO STEAL PAYMENT DATA ON THE RISE
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Zimperium researchers discovered over 760 malicious Android apps
exploiting Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Host Card Emulation
(HCE) to steal payment data through NFC relay attacks, showing
dramatic growth since April 2024. These apps impersonate trusted
financial institutions and trick users into setting them as default
NFC payment handlers, then use command-and-control servers to relay
card terminal requests and exfiltrate EMV data to Telegram channels.
The campaign has targeted over 20 institutions globally using 70+ C2
servers, primarily focusing on Russian banks but also affecting
European banks, Brazilian institutions, and services like Google Pay.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 YOU'LL NEVER SEE ATTRITION REFERENCED IN AN RCA (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Public incident reports intentionally omit staff attrition as a
contributing factor to reassure customers that issues are being
resolved, since mentioning workforce issues could undermine confidence
and create liability. Internal analyses also rarely consider
attrition, focusing instead on technical details rather than
organizational factors that increase system vulnerability. Attrition
is like smoking and lung cancer - it's a risk factor that heightens
the likelihood of failures without being necessary or sufficient on
its own. 

 MOSIP ON AWS: TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE EXPLORING ARCHITECTURE,
IMPLEMENTATION, AND DEPLOYMENT MODELS (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 AWS and Atos developed a cloud-based digital identity platform using
MOSIP, addressing security challenges with multi-layered defenses like
AWS Shield, WAF, CloudFront, segmented VPCs, and dedicated CloudHSM.
It offers four hybrid deployment models for data sovereignty, from
fully cloud to on-premises, with security controls such as data
encryption, role-based access via OAuth2, and monitoring through
GuardDuty and CloudWatch. Security teams should evaluate hybrid cloud
architectures for sensitive government systems, implement
defense-in-depth with hardware security modules, and use
Infrastructure-as-Code for consistent security controls. 

 CAN'T HIDE IN 3D (10 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Time-Terrain-Behavior (TTB) mapping can be used to transform logs and
security events into a 3D landscape to create a visual threat
landscape. The x-axis is set as the terrain layer and measures how
many different tools detected an entity, the y-axis measures how many
different time periods an entity was active in, and the z-axis
measures how many different actions an entity performs. This post
works through applying this methodology to the Splunk BOTS v2
scenario.

 USING GHIDRA TO PATCH MY KEYBOARD'S FIRMWARE (16 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 In this post, a researcher demonstrates firmware reverse engineering
on the Epomaker Galaxy100 keyboard using Ghidra to bypass VIA
configuration limitations and modify key mappings. The technical
approach involved extracting firmware via DFU mode (Fn+L+Esc), setting
up proper memory mapping in Ghidra for ARM Cortex-M3 architecture,
locating USB HID keycode tables through pattern matching, and directly
patching binary offsets to swap function key layers. Security
professionals can apply these techniques for embedded device analysis,
firmware modification workflows, and understanding how consumer
hardware implements bootloader protections and keycode handling
mechanisms.

 CHINA-LINKED HACKERS EXPLOITED LANSCOPE FLAW AS A ZERO-DAY IN ATTACKS
(2 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Chinese cyber-espionage group Bronze Butler (Tick) exploited
CVE-2025-61932, a critical request origin verification flaw in Motex
Lanscope Endpoint Manager versions 9.4.7.2 and earlier, as a zero-day
vulnerability for several months before it was patched in October. The
attackers exploited this vulnerability to achieve unauthenticated
remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges, deploying an updated
Gokcpdoor malware variant that features multiplexed
command-and-control communication and DLL sideloading for evasion,
along with tools such as goddi Active Directory dumper and 7-Zip for
data exfiltration to cloud storage services. Organizations using
Lanscope Endpoint Manager must immediately upgrade to patched
versions, as no workarounds exist, while security teams should monitor
for indicators of Bronze Butler activity, including Gokcpdoor malware,
OAED Loader, and connections to ports 38000/38002. 

 ALLEGED U PENN HACKER CLAIMS THEY'RE IN IT FOR MONEY, NOT
‘PRIMARILY “ANTI-DEI”' (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Hackers breached the University of Pennsylvania's systems, aiming to
sell roughly 1.2 million lines of personal donor data. Unlike previous
university hacks tied to diversity debates, this attack focused on
financial gain, not ideology. U Penn is investigating and has involved
the FBI as affected individuals have confirmed their stolen data. 

 METROPOLITAN POLICE HAILS FACIAL RECOGNITION TECH AFTER RECORD YEAR
FOR ARRESTS (3 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 London's Metropolitan Police credits live facial recognition
technology with enabling 962 arrests over the past year. While
officials cite improved public safety and broad support, privacy
advocates raise concerns about racial bias, noting 80 percent of false
alerts involved Black individuals. The report claims these disparities
are not statistically significant, yet critics argue for better
oversight and legal safeguards to protect civil rights.
