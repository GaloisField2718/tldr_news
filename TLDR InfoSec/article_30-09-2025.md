 HACKERS ❤️ MISCONFIGURATIONS (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Misconfigurations are the main way attackers break through your
defeneses, and they know it. That's why ThreatLocker® built DAC –
Defense Against Configuration [4].

DAC continuously scans every machine across your environment, flags
risky misconfigurations, and ranks them by severity. The findings show
up in visual dashboards and land in your inbox weekly, so nothing gets
missed.

Bonus: DAC maps every issue to major security frameworks [4] -
including NIST, HIPAA, and more - and delivers clear, step-by-step
remediation guidance.

Get rid of unused admin accounts, inactive firewall rules, and all the
other ways attackers sneak in to your environment. Explore

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CYBERATTACK ON CO-OP LEAVES SHELVES EMPTY, DATA STOLEN, AND $275M IN
LOST REVENUE (2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The DragonForce cybercrime group's April attack on UK retailer Co-op
resulted in $275 million in lost revenue, weeks of empty shelves, and
the theft of data from 6.5 million members, including names, contact
details, and dates of birth (though passwords and payment information
were not compromised). Co-op initially claimed no customer data was
affected, but later confirmed the breach after hackers contacted
executives via Microsoft Teams and phone, claiming to possess data on
20 million membership scheme participants. In July, the UK's National
Crime Agency arrested four suspects aged 17-20 in London and the West
Midlands on charges including Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail,
money laundering, and organized crime participation, with DragonForce
also claiming responsibility for attacks on M&S and an attempted
breach of Harrods. 

 MICROSOFT UNCOVERS NEW VARIANT OF XCSSET MACOS MALWARE IN TARGETED
ATTACKS (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Microsoft has discovered a new XCSSET macOS malware variant being
used in targeted attacks. It builds on the 2020 threat with advanced
features, including stealing Firefox credentials via a modified
HackBrowserData, hijacking cryptocurrency clipboard addresses using
regular expressions, and increasing persistence through LaunchDaemon
entries with AppleScripts and AES-encrypted C2 configurations. The
four-stage infection chain uses modular payloads for info theft
(vexyeqj/bnk), file exfiltration (neq_cdyd_ilvcmwx), persistence
(xmyyeqjx creates fake System Settings apps and disables updates), and
browser data extraction (iewmilh_cdyd targets passwords, cookies, and
credit cards in Firefox). Security teams should review Xcode projects
before use, deploy Microsoft Defender on macOS with cloud protection
and PUA blocking, verify clipboard content before pasting sensitive
information, and monitor for malicious LaunchDaemon entries (e.g.,
com.google.plists) and unusual creation of the ~/.root folder. 

 HACKERS CONTACT HARRODS AFTER 430K CUSTOMER RECORDS HIT BY IT BREACH
(2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Luxury department store Harrods was approached by attackers who stole
430,000 customer records. The compromised data contains only basic
personal details like names and contact information, along with
marketing information such as loyalty card data. Importantly, it does
not include passwords or financial information. Harrods has announced
that it will not pay the ransom.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 APT35 PLAYS THE SAME MUSIC AGAIN (3 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Stormshield's CTI team discovered two previously unreported servers
(84.200.193[.]20 and 79.132.131[.]184) linked to Iranian APT35
(Charming Kitten) by hunting for a distinctive HTML loading page
pattern using ssdeep fuzzy hashing and queries in SilentPush and
VirusTotal. The servers, active since July, host 49+ phishing domains
impersonating video conferencing services, such as Google Meet, with
typosquatting tactics (e.g., meet.go0gle[.]online), primarily
targeting Israeli victims based on URL submission patterns. Defenders
can track ongoing APT35 infrastructure using simple VirusTotal
queries, such as "entity:url url:online/?invitation" or "entity:domain
domain:viliam.*", to identify phishing domains that follow consistent
naming conventions despite the campaign being publicly documented. 

 SILENT PUSH EXAMINES THE DARK SIDE OF DYNAMIC DNS PROVIDERS (8 MINUTE
READ) [9] 

 Silent Push identified around 70,000 domains offering rentable
subdomains (Dynamic DNS providers) exploited by threat actors due to
minimal oversight, cryptocurrency payments, no KYC, and ignoring
takedown requests. Major APT groups like APT28, APT29, APT33,
Gamaredon, and Scattered Spider extensively use these for C2
infrastructure. While individual malicious subdomains can be
blocklisted, parent domains often remain active and spawn new threats.
The team created data exports (from the Public Suffix List,
afraid[.]org, DuckDNS, NoIP) to help security teams implement
risk-based blocking or alerting, balancing security with avoiding
disruption to legitimate access. 

 BUILDING AN AWS GUARDDUTY ALERT TRIAGE AGENT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This article explores how to create a GuardDuty triage agent using
PydanticAI and Discord. A user can call the agent using !triage in a
Discord channel, and it will investigate a specific alert, IAM user,
etc, and provide additional context as well as a verdict. The author
was impressed with how well the LLM could triage alerts, but
definitely felt that there was a lot of engineering effort in creating
the tools and fine-tuning the agent.

 HARDENING GOOGLE CLOUD: INSIGHTS FROM THE LATEST CLOUD VRP BUGSWAT (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Google Cloud's record-breaking bugSWAT event brought together 20
elite security researchers who submitted 130 reports, uncovering 91
vulnerabilities across the platform. The event resulted in
approximately $1.6 million in bounty rewards (with 100% bonuses
applied), pushing Google's total Cloud VRP payouts to ~$2.5M for 2025.
High-severity findings included a network egress filter bypass that
enabled SSRF attacks and SQL injection vulnerabilities in database
connectors, both of which have now been patched. 

 DOD ISSUES REPLACEMENT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK (3 MINUTE READ)
[17] 

 The Department of Defense (DoD) unveiled a new Cybersecurity Risk
Management Construct to replace its previous risk management system.
The new system defines a five-phased lifecycle which includes: a
design phase which incorporates security from the outset, a build
phase where secure designs are implemented to achieve Initial
Operating Capacity, a test phase where validation and stress testing
are performed before Full Operating Capacity, an onboarding phase
where automated continuous monitoring is activated, and finally an
operations phase where real-time dashboards and alerting mechanisms
provide immediate detection and response. 

 MICROSOFT FORCED TO MAKE WINDOWS 10 EXTENDED SECURITY UPDATES TRULY
FREE IN EUROPE (2 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 Windows 10 will reach end-of-life on October 14. Microsoft had
previously announced that users who enabled Windows Backup would be
entitled to a year of free extended security updates. This move drew
some controversy due to its requiring the use of OneDrive to receive
security updates. Following pressure from the Euroconsumers consumer
advocacy group, Microsoft has dropped the Windows Backup requirement
for European users, but will still require the use of a Microsoft
account.
