ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 FLICKR EMAILS USERS ABOUT DATA BREACH, PINS IT ON 3RD PARTY (1 MINUTE
READ) [4] 

 Flickr disclosed a data breach stemming from a compromised
third-party email service provider, with attackers potentially
accessing names, email addresses, usernames, IP addresses, general
locations, and platform activity. The company shut down access to the
affected system within hours and notified data protection authorities
in both Europe and the US. No passwords or financial data were
reportedly exposed, though Flickr has urged users to watch for
phishing attempts and review account settings. 

 NEW CLICKFIX VARIANT 'CRASHFIX' DEPLOYING PYTHON REMOTE ACCESS TROJAN
(9 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 Microsoft identified a new ClickFix variant dubbed "CrashFix" that
uses a malicious Chrome extension impersonating uBlock Origin Lite to
deliberately crash victims' browsers, then tricks users into executing
clipboard-copied commands via a fake security warning. The attack
chain abuses the legitimate Windows utility finger.exe (renamed to
ct.exe) to retrieve obfuscated PowerShell payloads, ultimately
deploying a Python-based RAT called ModeloRAT that selectively targets
domain-joined enterprise systems for further compromise. ModeloRAT
beacons to hardcoded C2 servers over HTTP, establishes persistence via
registry Run keys and scheduled tasks, and conducts network
reconnaissance using native Windows commands like nltest and net use. 

 PAYMENTS PLATFORM BRIDGEPAY CONFIRMS RANSOMWARE ATTACK BEHIND OUTAGE
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 BridgePay Networks Solutions has confirmed that an ongoing outage in
its payment gateway and other services is caused by a ransomware
attack. The company has stated that it is confident that payment
details and credit card information have not been compromised.
BridgePay has not responded to questions about which ransomware gang
is behind the attack.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 DEOBFUSCATION AND ANALYSIS OF RING-1.IO (19 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers reverse-engineered ring-1.io, a prominent game cheat
provider, revealing a sophisticated attack chain that replaces EFI
boot binaries, injects into Hyper-V via VMEXIT hooks, and uses
EPT-based memory redirection to hide malicious code from kernel-level
anti-cheat systems. The implant operates across three privilege
boundaries — guest user mode, guest kernel mode, and VMX root —
using cloned page tables, CR3 spoofing, and shadow pages filled with
0xCE bytes to evade detection. The analysis also outlines multiple
detection strategies, including shadow PML4E scanning, Intel Processor
Trace analysis, and RWX anomaly detection under HVCI, emphasizing that
Secure Boot enforcement would prevent the entire attack chain. 

 HOW WE PREVENTED CURSOR, WINDSURF, & GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY FROM
RECOMMENDING MALWARE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Researchers discovered that AI IDEs forked from VSCode, including
Cursor, Windsurf, and Google Antigravity, inherited hardcoded
extension recommendation lists pointing to Microsoft marketplace
namespaces that were unclaimed on OpenVSX, the open-source alternative
these IDEs actually use. An attacker could have registered these
unclaimed namespaces and uploaded malicious extensions that the IDEs
would proactively recommend to millions of developers based on file
types or installed software. The researchers preemptively claimed the
vulnerable namespaces and coordinated with the Eclipse Foundation and
vendors to remediate, noting that over 1,000 developers installed
their inert placeholder extensions simply because their IDE
recommended them. 

 GOODBYE TO STATIC CREDENTIALS: EMBRACE MODERN IDENTITY PRACTICES (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Static credentials are prone to leakage, can cause significant
damage, and can be difficult to rotate. To prevent this, many
organizations adopted interim secrets management solutions, such as
AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault. In the long term,
organizations should shift to modern, short-lived credentials, such as
managed identities (e.g., AWS roles), federated identities, and
application-specific methods for Kubernetes and AI agents.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 PASSWORD MANAGER SHOWDOWN: G2 COMPARED 14 SOLUTIONS. ONE DOMINATED
THE COMPETITION (SPONSOR) [10] 

 When G2 analyzed 14 enterprise password managers, the results weren't
even close [10]. Bitwarden scored 98/100 on user satisfaction, way
above Keeper (92), 1Password (66), and LastPass (58). Bitwarden also
had 29% faster ROI, with 83% of Bitwarden customers live in <30 days.

 HERMES (GITHUB REPO) (1 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Hermes is a Linux-only Mythic C2 agent written in Python, featuring
18 built-in commands for reconnaissance, file operations, and shell
execution. The agent communicates via HTTP, using Mythic's EKE + AES
encryption, and can be deployed as a Python script or a PyInstaller
binary. It supports core post-exploitation tasks, including process
listing, network enumeration, file transfer, and directory
manipulation on Linux targets. 

 SHAREPOINTDUMPER (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 SharePointDumper is a PowerShell-based extraction and auditing
utility that enumerates SharePoint sites a user has access to via
Microsoft Graph and downloads files via SharePoint. 

 CLAWDSTRIKE (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Clawdstrike provides runtime security enforcement for agents. It is
designed for developers building EDRs and security solutions on top of
OpenClaw.

 'ENCRYPT IT ALREADY' CAMPAIGN PUSHES BIG TECH TO PRIORITIZE E2E
ENCRYPTION (6 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Electronic Frontier Foundation launched its "Encrypt It Already"
campaign, urging major tech companies such as Bluesky, Google, and
Ring to fulfill their promises to implement end-to-end encryption by
default across their platforms. The initiative highlights that many
companies either offer E2EE as an opt-in feature or have delayed
rolling it out entirely, leaving users exposed, particularly as AI
agents increasingly access sensitive communications with less human
oversight. EFF noted that several targeted companies are "highly
likely" to enable these features within the year, but stressed that
default-on encryption remains critical since most users never change
default settings. 

 A LINKEDIN JOB OFFER TRIED TO INSTALL MALWARE ON MY MACHINE (10
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 The author received a LinkedIn post about a freelance opportunity to
evaluate the codebase of a real estate tech platform with a
legitimate-looking platform and a generous budget. The author accepted
the offer and was given access to the codebase, but missed red flags
such as a missed call with their Tech Manager, suspicious git history,
and suspicious indicators in their contact's LinkedIn profile. Upon
reviewing the repository, the author found an npm post-install script
that would download a C2 backdoor, exfiltrate sensitive files, and
capture keystrokes. 

 SIXTEEN CLAUDE AI AGENTS WORKING TOGETHER CREATED A NEW C COMPILER (5
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini used 16 parallel Claude Opus
4.6 agents coordinating via a shared Git repository to produce a
100,000-line Rust-based C compiler capable of compiling a bootable
Linux kernel across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures. The two-week,
$20,000 experiment achieved a 99% pass rate on the GCC torture test
suite but hit a practical ceiling around 100,000 lines where new fixes
frequently broke existing functionality, suggesting current limits for
autonomous agentic coding. The researcher noted significant human
scaffolding was required — including custom test harnesses,
context-aware output filtering, and time-boxing — raising concerns
about developers deploying AI-generated software they have never
personally verified.
