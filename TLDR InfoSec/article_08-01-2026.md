 PROTECT YOUR ENTIRE WORKSPACE FOR THE COST OF EMAIL SECURITY
(SPONSOR) [4] 

 Today's email security stops at the perimeter. Once an attacker slips
past your inbound detections, they have free reign over years of
sensitive emails, files, and internal comms.

Material [4] protects the email, files, and accounts that live in
Google Workspace and Microsoft 365, improving security outcomes and
boosting efficiency for the same cost of email security alone.

Once deployed, Material [4] ingests all of your settings, contents,
and logs and translates them into:

 	* Step-up authentication for sensitive content
 	* Blast radius visualization for accounts,
 	* The ability to detect and respond to threats and risk across the
cloud workspace.

The fastest-growing companies trust Material. Book a demo to find out
what Figma, Reddit, Doordash, Lyft, and many more already know. [4]

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ONGOING ATTACKS EXPLOITING CRITICAL RCE VULNERABILITY IN LEGACY
D-LINK DSL ROUTERS (5 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 CVE-2026-0625, a critical command injection vulnerability in legacy
D-Link DSL routers' dnscfg.cgi endpoint, has been actively exploited
in the wild since November 2025, targeting end-of-life models
including DSL-2740R, DSL-2640B, DSL-2780B, and DSL-526B. The
unauthenticated remote code execution flaw enables attackers to hijack
DNS settings without credentials, allowing them to redirect traffic
and persistently compromise all downstream devices behind the router.
Organizations must immediately retire affected unpatchable devices and
upgrade to actively supported models, as the vulnerability leverages
the same DNS configuration mechanism used in previous large-scale
DNSChanger campaigns. 

 INSURER PROSURA HIT BY CYBER DATA BREACH, CUSTOMERS CONTACTED BY
THREAT ACTOR (2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Australian rental car insurance provider Prosura suffered a data
breach that impacted an undisclosed number of customers. The leaked
data may include names, email addresses, phone numbers, country of
residence, travel details, invoicing and pricing data, and policy
dates. The threat actor also directly contacted impacted customers,
alleging that the company has been ignoring them. 

 LEDGER CUSTOMERS IMPACTED BY THIRD-PARTY GLOBAL-E DATA BREACH (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Ledger has informed some customers who made purchases on ledger.com
that their personal data was compromised as part of a breach impacting
the third-party payment processor Global-e. Ledger and Global-e have
confirmed that no financial information or wallet seed phrases were
leaked as part of this breach. Global-e is also notifying other
impacted companies that utilize its services.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 THE MAC MALWARE OF 2025 (35 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 The 2025 macOS threat landscape was characterized by a surge in
sophisticated infostealers and state-sponsored backdoors that
increasingly leverage "Malware-as-a-Service" models and social
engineering vectors such as "ClickFix" and fake job interviews.
Technical analysis reveals that attackers are bypassing Gatekeeper and
static analysis by utilizing signed or notarized binaries and
executing multi-stage payloads written in Go, Python, and AppleScript
directly in memory. To combat these evolving threats, security
professionals must move beyond static signatures to implement
behavioral monitoring of process, file, and network activity while
educating users on the dangers of executing terminal commands from
untrusted sources. 

 VIBE HACKING: PROXYING FLUTTER TRAFFIC ON ANDROID WITH CLAUDE (6
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Cronometer's Android app uses Flutter's own TLS stack, which ignores
system proxies and bakes certificate pinning into libflutter.so,
making traditional MITM approaches fail. By combining Frida on a
rooted Pixel with custom hooks, it becomes possible to detect and
patch Flutter's TLS verification, observe DNS lookups and socket
connections, and then transparently redirect selected hosts through a
proxy like mitmproxy. Injecting an HTTP CONNECT tunnel at the syscall
level lets HTTPS traffic flow through the proxy without modifying the
APK. 

 ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT JA3 & JA4 FINGERPRINTS (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 JA3 and JA4 are both methods for building a client fingerprint from
the TLS Client Hello. JA4 adds functionality and human readability and
is harder for threat actors to change. Both fingerprints can be
effective in threat hunting or monitoring.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 DIASYMBOLVIEW (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 DiaSymbolView is a tool for visually inspecting debug information
recorded in .pdb files. It relies on the MSDIA API and presents a
hierarchy of debug symbols and their 200+ properties. 

 LYNIS (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Lynis is a security auditing tool for Linux, macOS, and UNIX-based
systems. It helps with compliance testing (such as HIPAA, ISO27001,
and PCI DSS) and system hardening. It is agentless, with optional
installation. 

 OPTI (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Opti is an IAM platform that uses specialized LLMs to automate
identity governance, least-privilege decisions, and remediation across
enterprise environments.

 AUTOMATED DATA POISONING PROPOSED AS A SOLUTION FOR AI THEFT THREAT
(5 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 AURA is a tool that injects plausible false data into AI knowledge
graphs, rendering stolen proprietary data useless while authorized
users maintain access through secret keys that filter out the poisoned
information. The technique degrades unauthorized systems' accuracy to
5.3% while maintaining 100% fidelity for legitimate users, with an
under 14% increase in query latency, though experts express skepticism
about data poisoning's effectiveness and note that the solution
doesn't prevent insider tampering with knowledge graphs. Security
professionals should recognize that AI systems face unique challenges
in detecting and recovering from compromised data, as poisoned
information can propagate through machine learning processes faster
than traditional database corruption. 

 KRAKENLABS RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS 2025: THE SHIFTS THAT REDEFINED THE
THREAT LANDSCAPE (14 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 2025's threat landscape evolution was characterized by AI integration
into cybercrime workflows, industrialized Crimeware-as-a-Service
platforms like Olymp Loader and LabInstalls PPI distribution, and
Initial Access Brokers monetizing compromised edge devices, including
Belsen Group's sale of 15,000 FortiGate device accesses. The year
witnessed a decline in traditional carding fraud under regulatory
pressure, while threat actors shifted toward identity abuse and trust
exploitation, exemplified by attacks on Salesforce-hosted airline data
and on cryptocurrency platforms targeted for geopolitical impact
rather than financial gain. Analysis revealed the convergence of
ideological hacktivism with ransomware business models, including
pro-Palestinian actor zerodayx1's BQTLock RaaS offering and leaked
Black Basta chats that exposed operational dynamics, underscoring that
basic security failures and third-party risk management remain
decisive factors in organizational breach outcomes. 

 HACKERONE 'GHOSTED' ME FOR MONTHS OVER $8,500 BUG BOUNTY, SAYS
RESEARCHER (4 MINUTE READ). [16] 

 Security researcher Jakub Ciolek reported two high‑severity Argo CD
denial‑of‑service bugs through HackerOne's Internet Bug Bounty,
expecting about $8,500 after CVEs were assigned and patches shipped.
Instead, he faced months of silence despite repeated follow‑ups,
raising concerns about trust in crowdfunded bounty programs and the
impact of noisy, low‑quality, or AI‑generated reports on serious
submissions.
