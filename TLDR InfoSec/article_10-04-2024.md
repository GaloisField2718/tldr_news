 AGING GRACEFULLY? NEW RESEARCH FINDS 91% OF ORGANIZATIONS HAVE 10+
YEARS OLD VULNERABILITIES (SPONSOR) [3] 

 Orca‚Äôs 2024 State of Cloud Security Report [3] highlights risks
found in actual production environments, based on data captured from
billions of cloud assets [3] on all major public cloud providers.
The researchers found that basic security practices are still lacking
[3]. Even more troubling, many risks reside on exposed and public
assets ‚Äî for example, 21% of organizations [3] store sensitive data
in a public-facing storage bucket.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL TAKEOVER VULNERABILITIES IN 92,000 D-LINK DEVICES UNDER
ACTIVE EXPLOITATION (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in 92,000 D-Link devices to
take control remotely. The vulnerabilities exist in end-of-life
devices no longer supported by the manufacturer. Users should update
firmware or replace outdated hardware to protect against these
attacks. 

 MICROSOFT FIXES TWO WINDOWS ZERO-DAYS EXPLOITED IN MALWARE ATTACKS (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Microsoft fixed two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in
the latest Patch Tuesday, addressing malware attacks. One
vulnerability involved a malicious driver signed with a valid
Microsoft certificate, while the other bypassed a security feature to
deploy malware on Windows systems. 

 FAKE FACEBOOK MIDJOURNEY AI PAGE PROMOTED MALWARE TO 1.2M PEOPLE (3
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Hackers have been leveraging hijacked Facebook accounts to
impersonate legitimate AI services like MidJourney and OpenAI‚Äôs SORA
to trick users into installing malware. The pages utilize Facebook ads
that pushed communities that supposedly allowed members to test new
features but instead posted links to download malware masquerading as
beta versions of the software. One particularly successful campaign
operated a MidJourney page that amassed 1.2 million members over
nearly a year.

The vulnerabilities involve inter-process communication and filesystem
manipulation and can lead to potential exploitation for impactful
attacks. 

 HOW TO GENERATE SECURITY FINDINGS TO HELP YOUR SECURITY TEAM WITH
INTERNAL IR SIMULATIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 A tutorial from AWS on how to create security events for testing IR
playbooks. The solution generates findings for a list of included CVEs
