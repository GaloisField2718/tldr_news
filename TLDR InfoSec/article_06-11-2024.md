ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 OKTA AD/LDAP DELEGATED AUTHENTICATION VULNERABILITY (2 MINUTE READ)
[5] 

 Okta discovered a vulnerability in the DelAuth procedure for Okta
AD/LDAP that allows users with usernames with a length equal to or
greater than 52 characters to authenticate with only a username and a
stored cache key of a previous authentication (no password needed).
This issue was resolved in Okta's production systems on October 30.
Okta recommends that customers review their logs from July 23 to
October 30 for evidence of exploitation. 

 LASTPASS WARNS OF FAKE SUPPORT CENTERS TRYING TO STEAL CUSTOMER DATA
(2 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 There is a new phishing campaign that targets users by posting
reviews with a fake customer support number. When users call the
number, a fake customer support agent instructs them to enter a code
on a website that installs the ConnectWise SmartConnect software. The
customer support agent then asks questions and attempts to
troubleshoot the issue while an accomplice uses the SmartConnect
software to steal data or install other malware. The same customer
support number has been seen in attacks on Netflix, Amazon, iCloud,
and others. 

 RHYSIDA RANSOMWARE ATTACK ON COLUMBUS CLAIMED 500K VICTIMS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 500,000 people in Columbus, Ohio were affected by a ransomware attack
in July claimed by the Rhysida gang. The stolen personal information
included names, addresses, bank details, and Social Security numbers.
The city dropped a lawsuit against a security researcher who was
accused of exposing sensitive data from the attack.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 BREACHING THE DATA PERIMETER: CLOUDTRAIL AS A MECHANISM IN DATA
EXFILTRATION (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 AWS CloudTrail's behavior with VPC Endpoints allowed data
exfiltration through denied cross-account requests. Exploiting the
vulnerability requires creating a DynamoDB table with specific
resource policies and using custom user-agents to smuggle data through
CloudTrail logs. While now patched, the vulnerability demonstrates how
CloudTrail's inconsistent logging behavior across services can be
exploited for data exfiltration. 

 HOW WE USE DATADOG FOR DETECTION AS CODE (8 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This blog post outlines DataDog's Detection as Code (DaC) workflow,
Terraform repository structure, and testing strategy. The DataDog
team's process involves defining a query in the UI, exporting the
detection to Terraform from the UI, committing it to source code with
tests based on Stratus Red Team, and then deploying via a GitLab CI/CD
pipeline. The post provides samples of rules, suppressions, tests, and
Terraform configurations. 

 LEVERAGING WAZUH FOR ZERO TRUST SECURITY (6 MINUTE READ) [10]

Trust security to protect against cyber threats and compliance
limitations of traditional security models.

 HOW TO BUILD A SECURITY GUARDIANS PROGRAM TO DISTRIBUTE SECURITY
OWNERSHIP (7 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 AWS has developed a Security Guardians program that empowers builders
to make security decisions to enable security efforts (threat
modeling, security reviews, etc) at scale. AWS has defined five steps
to creating a security guardians program: set the program vision,
identify innovators with a passion for security, define the behaviors
that guardians will be expected to perform, maintain guardians'
interest by providing opportunities to learn new skills and potential
for career advancement, and measure the success of the program by
gathering feedback as well as other metrics. 

 WHEN AI GETS HIJACKED: EXPLOITING HOSTED MODELS FOR DARK ROLEPLAYING
(14 MINUTE READ) [16]

attackers hijacking models for dark roleplaying applications. Permiso
discovered attackers hosting a sexual roleplaying chatbot using
hijacked LLM infrastructure in AWS. The attacker bypassed content
filters to enable sexual and violent content, including potentially
illegal material. 

 DOCUSIGN'S ENVELOPES API ABUSED TO SEND REALISTIC FAKE INVOICES (2
MINUTE READ) [17] 

 Threat actors are using DocuSign's Envelopes API to send fake
invoices impersonating well-known brands like Norton and PayPal.
Attackers are bypassing email security protections to trick recipients
into e-signing these documents to authorize payments. This large-scale
abuse of the API has been reported to DocuSign.
