ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CRITICAL LANGFLOW RCE FLAW EXPLOITED TO HACK AI APP SERVERS (2 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Langflow offers a visual programming tool for building LLM-powered
workflows using LangChain components. An unauthenticated RCE
vulnerability where Langflow's /api/v1/validate/code endpoint, which
is designed to validate user-submitted code, runs any code with no
sandboxing or sanitization. CISA has now reported that this
vulnerability is being actively exploited and has given federal
agencies until May 26 to upgrade the software or add mitigations such
as placing the software behind a firewall. 

 SECOND OTTOKIT VULNERABILITY EXPLOITED TO HACK WORDPRESS SITES (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Threat actors have been observed exploiting a new vulnerability in
the OttoKit WordPress plugin. The vulnerability could allow
unauthenticated attackers to connect to impacted sites that have never
enabled or used an application password due to a lack of proper
authentication checks in the create_wp_connection() function.
Attackers have been observed attempting to exploit the vulnerability
to create an admin user account through the automation/action
endpoint. 

 UNSOPHISTICATED HACKERS TARGETING ICS/SCADA SYSTEMS: CISA (3 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Unsophisticated hackers are increasingly targeting industrial control
systems in the energy and transportation sectors. Federal agencies
recommend removing internet connections, changing default passwords,
securing remote access, segmenting networks, and maintaining manual
operation capabilities to protect critical infrastructure.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 SECURE CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS IS TRICKY. FOUR COMMON DANGEROUS
MISCONCEPTIONS (5 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 IAM role trust policies are the best-practice foundation for
cross-account access. However, many users misunderstand the security
implications associated with them. When creating role trust policies,
users should keep in mind the risk of lateral movement in both their
account and the account that they're trusting and therefore be aware
that other principals could potentially use the role then those
specified in the policy and could potentially gain access to other
roles that the policy is not applied to. Many users also mistake the
security importance of the management/payer account and allow trust
policies to flow between less secure and more secure accounts within
an organization. 

 ORGSEC GUIDE (1 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The OrgSec Guide structures essential topics for effectively running
a successful security program. It includes a compilation of resources,
checklists, and addresses in DevSecOps, endpoint and product security,
GRC, IAM, infrastructure, operational and cloud security, security
operations, and AI. 

 DETECT CONTAINER ESCAPE VULNERABILITIES WITH OSQUERY (5 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 This guide explains how to use Osquery to detect container escape
vulnerabilities in real-time by monitoring suspicious system calls and
container activities. It presents three practical SQL queries that can
be scheduled to run at 30-second intervals to detect namespace pivots,
CVE-2024-21626 style escapes, and containers attempting to access the
host kernel or metadata services. The guide also covers deployment
steps, performance tuning tips, and integration options with logging
platforms like Uptycs, Fleet, Splunk, and Loki.
