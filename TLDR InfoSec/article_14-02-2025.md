 üí® SPEEDRUNNING FEDRAMP ATO (SPONSOR) [4] 

 The first step to tap into the $30B+ federal market?

Achieving FedRAMP Authorization to Operate (ATO).

But while an ATO can unlock enormous revenue streams, the
accreditation process and continuous monitoring can be incredibly slow
and expensive. Most organizations spend 12-18 months trying to clear
the technical hurdles for ATO, with extensive consulting costs. So
what are some practical strategies for simplifying technical FedRAMP
obstacles?

>> Find out how to accelerate your ATO timelines and simplify
continuous monitoring in the upcoming Chainguard webinar [4].

The expert panel, led by Chainguard and Coalfire technical leaders,
will dive into FedRAMP's evolving controls and the latest 2025
revisions [4] around CVE remediation, FIPS cryptography, STIG
hardening, and POA&M reporting. They'll also suggest actionable and
battle-tested ways to overcome FedRAMP's biggest hurdles [4] quickly
and cost-effectively.

sold on cybercrime networks for $2,000 and includes custom hosting
options to evade detection.

 HOW SECURITY TEAMS FAIL (4 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 Michal Zalewski discusses common pitfalls in corporate security
teams, from their origins to cultural challenges and eventual

major breach that prompts a reevaluation of the team's strategy and
communication.
