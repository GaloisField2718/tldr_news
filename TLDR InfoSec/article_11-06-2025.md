 VIDEO: HOW WE BLOCKED A RANSOMWARE ATTACK (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Attackers used stolen domain admin credentials to infiltrate a
hospital network - aiming to deploy remote access tools, steal
sensitive data, and unleash ransomware.

Watch this short video [4] to learn how this attack crippled other
hospitals, and how ThreatLocker stopped it in its tracks [4]:

 	* Application Allowlisting blocked unauthorized software from
running.
 	* Storage Control prevented data from being accessed or moved.
 	* The attackers couldn't deploy tools.
 	* They couldn't spread.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 NEARLY 300K CRASH RECORDS STOLEN FROM TEXAS TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT
(2 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Texas Department of Transportation is notifying the impacted
individuals of a data breach of its Crash Reports Information System
(CRIS). The breached data includes full names, addresses, driver's
license numbers, license plate numbers, and car insurance policy
numbers. An attacker obtained the data via a compromised account. 

 SENSITIVE INFORMATION STOLEN IN SENSATA RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE
READ) [6] 

 Sensata Technologies confirmed hackers stole sensitive employee data
during a March-April ransomware attack. The stolen information
includes Social Security numbers, financial details, and health
insurance data. 

 FOUND IN THE WILD: 2 SECURE BOOT EXPLOITS. MICROSOFT IS PATCHING ONLY
1 OF THEM (3 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Researchers discovered two Secure Boot bypass exploits affecting 50+
device makers. Microsoft patched CVE-2025-3052 (DT Research firmware
tool vulnerability) but left CVE-2025-47827 (IGEL Linux OS flaw)
unpatched. Both allow attackers with physical access to install
pre-boot malware, defeating Secure Boot's core security purpose
against "evil maid" attacks.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 GARTNER: HOW SECURITY TEAMS CAN TURN HYPE INTO OPPORTUNITY (6 MINUTE
READ) [8] 

 At Gartner's Security Summit, analysts advised harnessing AI and
cybersecurity hype constructively rather than letting it drive hasty
decisions. They recommended using protection level agreements and
outcome-driven metrics for fact-based security conversations with
executives. Security teams must develop AI literacy while protecting
organizational AI investments from emerging threats. 

 NEW PROCESS INJECTION CLASS: THE CONTEXT-ONLY ATTACK SURFACE (10
MINUTE READ) [9] 

 Most process injection techniques typically begin by allocating
memory, writing to that memory, and then executing it. However, the
researchers in this post explored the possibility of process injection
while only using the execution step. The researchers first achieved
their goal by dropping a malicious DLL and then executing it by
abusing that LoadLibraryA automatically appends “.dll” to strings
that are passed to it. The researchers then took this one step further
and used CreateRemoteThread with SetThreadContext and NTCreateThread
to execute code in a remote process without needing to write a DLL to
disk. 

 HIGH LEVERAGE SECURITY DECISIONS (6 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This post presents a list of security decisions that can be made
early in a startup's lifecycle to enhance long-term security while
providing the most value early on. The list includes organizational
security and IAM-related decisions such as choosing an Identity
Provider, adopting security keys, and using a Mobile Device Management
(MDM) solution. The list also includes architectural decisions like
adopting Infrastructure as Code and using managed infrastructure where
possible.

 M&S ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM OPERATIONAL 46 DAYS AFTER CYBER SHUTDOWN
(2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 Marks & Spencer has partially restored online orders following an
April cyberattack, with select fashion ranges now available in
England, Scotland, and Wales. Services remain limited - no Northern
Ireland delivery, Click & Collect, or next-day options. 

 RESEARCHERS UNCOVER POSSIBLE IPHONE SPYWARE CAMPAIGN INSIDE US (2
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Researchers from iVerify detected behavior indicative of tampering
and spyware in iPhones belonging to high-value targets in an EU member
state's government, US political campaigns, media organizations, and
an AI company. The hackers targeted the individuals via the
“Nickname” feature in iOS, which sends a notification whenever
someone's iCloud photo or name changes. Apple has fixed the
vulnerability being used and claimed that it has uncovered no evidence
of exploitation. 

 BRUTEFORCING THE PHONE NUMBER OF ANY GOOGLE USER (6 MINUTE READ) [16]


 A researcher found a way to guess Google users' phone numbers using
the no-JavaScript account recovery form. They could quickly check
thousands of numbers by combining phone number hints from password
reset flows and a guessed name. Google has now fixed this issue by
removing the no-JS form.
