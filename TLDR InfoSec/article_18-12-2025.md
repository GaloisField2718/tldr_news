 FORGET THE POWERPOINT DEMO. TEST YOUR ENDPOINT SECURITY AGAINST REAL
MALWARE (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Most endpoint vendors expect you to trust their marketing. Arctic
Wolf hands you real malware and says "go ahead."

The Aurora Endpoint Experience [4] is a self-guided test drive in a
safe cyber range. 

You get a VM, the Aurora agent, and six use cases covering everything
from zero-day prevention to threat hunting with advanced queries
[4]. 

Watch behavioral detections fire, see MITRE ATT&CK classifications
populate, and trigger autonomous responses — all with the same
console paying customers use.

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ARCTIC WOLF OBSERVES MALICIOUS SSO LOGINS ON FORTIGATE DEVICES
FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE OF CVE-2025-59718 AND CVE-2025-59719 (9 MINUTE
READ) [5] 

 Arctic Wolf observed active exploitation of critical Fortinet
authentication bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-59718 and
CVE-2025-59719) starting December 12, just three days after Fortinet's
disclosure. Attackers used crafted SAML messages to gain
unauthenticated admin access to FortiGate devices with FortiCloud SSO
enabled. Threat actors logged in via SSO from hosting provider IPs and
immediately exfiltrated device configurations containing hashed
credentials via the GUI. Organizations should promptly upgrade
affected versions of FortiOS, FortiProxy, FortiWeb, and
FortiSwitchManager, disable FortiCloud SSO as a workaround, reset all
firewall credentials if compromise indicators are observed, and
restrict management interface access to trusted internal networks. 

 AUTO PARTS GIANT LKQ CONFIRMS ORACLE EBS BREACH (3 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Automotive parts supplier LKQ has confirmed it was hit in the Oracle
E-Business Suite hacking campaign linked to the Cl0p ransomware group,
exposing personal data, including SSNs and EINs, of over 9,000 sole
proprietor suppliers. The company says the incident is limited to its
Oracle EBS environment, though several terabytes of data were stolen,
and notes it previously suffered a separate cyberattack affecting a
Canadian business unit. 

 WHATSAPP DEVICE LINKING ABUSED IN ACCOUNT HIJACKING ATTACKS (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Gen Digital researchers have uncovered a new phishing campaign, which
they dubbed GhostPairing, that abuses the device-linking feature of
WhatsApp to hijack accounts. The victims are contacted by a known
contact that shares a link allegedly leading to an online photo of a
victim, which leads to a fake Facebook site that requests the user to
initiate a device-linking process to log in. Attackers can then use
the victim's account to forward the initial lure and propagate.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 WE SHOULD ALL BE USING DEPENDENCY COOLDOWNS (4 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Analysis of recent supply chain attacks, including xz-utils,
Ultralytics, tj-actions, and web3.js, revealed that most exploitation
windows last only hours to days before detection and remediation. 8
out of 10 examined attacks had windows under one week. Implementing a
7-14 day dependency cooldown via Dependabot or Renovate would have
prevented 80-90% of these attacks by simply waiting for compromised
packages to be identified and removed before adoption. The technique
is free, easy to configure, and among the most effective mitigations
against mass-impact supply chain compromises. 

 DETECTING MALICIOUS PULL REQUESTS AT SCALE WITH LLMS (13 MINUTE READ)
[9] 

 Datadog's BewAIre is an LLM-powered system that reviews every pull
request for malicious intent. Achieving over 99.3% accuracy and a
0.03% false positive rate after six months of tuning, the system
addresses limitations of traditional static analysis by detecting
intent-based attacks, such as credential exfiltration and obfuscated
payloads, and by using recursive diff chunking to handle large PRs
that attackers exploit to hide malicious code. Security teams can
apply similar approaches by combining curated malicious datasets,
prompt engineering with pattern exclusions, and adversarial
red-teaming to build LLM-based detection that complements existing
SAST/SCA tooling. 

 AUTHORIZING ACCESS TO DATA WITH RAG IMPLEMENTATIONS (6 MINUTE READ)
[10] 

 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is commonly used by
organizations to augment an LLM's knowledge base with additional
information, such as internal documentation. RAG poses authorization
risks as the LLM performs the search, so any authorization checks at
the data source are skipped. This tutorial shows how to use S3 Access
Grants with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to add authorization checks
to the RAG flow.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 OWASP SOCIAL OSINT AGENT (GITHUB REPO) [11] 

 OWASP Social OSINT Agent is an agent designed for OSINT
investigations that leverages both text and vision-capable LLMs via
any OpenAI-compatible API to gather, analyze, and synthesize user
activity across single or multiple social media accounts. 

 DUX (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [12] 

 Dux is an agentic exposure management startup that uses AI workers to
analyze enterprise environments, identify exploitable attack paths,
validate existing controls, and recommend lightweight mitigations to
prevent vulnerability exploitation across assets. 

 YAKLANG (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 YAK is a large-scale cybersecurity technology stack built around a
domain-specific language. It spans compiler technology, security
infrastructure, vulnerability analysis, and many other areas.

MISCELLANEOUS

 MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW SERVING MALICIOUS CONTENT (6 MINUTE READ)
[14] 

 Infoblox research shows over 90% of parked domains now redirect
visitors to scams, malware, or infostealers, up from less than 5% a
decade ago. Malicious redirects target residential IPs, while VPN
users see safe parking pages. One threat actor controls nearly 3,000
typosquatting domains targeting major sites such as Gmail, YouTube,
Netflix, and government sites, hosting a mail server to capture
misaddressed emails for business email attacks. Users should use
bookmarks instead of typing to avoid typosquatting. 

 THE 2025 CLOUDFLARE RADAR YEAR IN REVIEW: THE RISE OF AI,
POST-QUANTUM, AND RECORD-BREAKING DDOS ATTACKS (47 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Cloudflare recorded unprecedented DDoS attacks in 2025, with
hyper-volumetric assaults reaching 31.4 Tbps and 14 Bpps. During this
period, global Internet traffic increased by 19%, and AI crawler
activity surged, with Googlebot accounting for 4.5% of HTML requests
and user action crawling rising over 15 times. Adoption of
post-quantum encryption nearly doubled, covering 52% of
human-generated web traffic. An email security analysis revealed 5.6%
of messages as malicious, mainly due to deceptive links. 174 major
Internet outages were documented, with nearly half caused by
government-enforced shutdowns. Security professionals should closely
watch the expanding capacity for hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks, adopt
post-quantum cryptography as it becomes widely used, and enhance email
security measures against sophisticated impersonation and brand
deception attacks enabled by AI-generated content. 

 MICROSOFT SECURITY UPDATES BREAKS MSMQ ON OLDER WIN SYSTEMS (3 MINUTE
READ) [16] 

 Microsoft acknowledges that December 2025 security updates have
broken Microsoft Message Queuing on some older Windows 10 and Windows
Server systems, causing inactive queues. The root cause is tightened
NTFS permissions on the MSMQ storage folder, which now block required
write access for MSMQ users. Only older, mostly enterprise systems are
affected. There is no proper fix beyond workarounds or uninstalling
the update.
