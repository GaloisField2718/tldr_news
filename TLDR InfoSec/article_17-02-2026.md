ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 RESEARCHERS UNEARTH 30-YEAR-OLD VULNERABILITY IN LIBPNG LIBRARY (3
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 A heap buffer overflow (CVE-2026-25646, CVSS 8.3) in the libpng
library, present since its inception nearly 30 years ago, has been
patched in version 1.6.55. The flaw lies in the png_set_quantize
function, which is used to reduce color in PNG images. Exploitation
requires careful heap grooming and crafted-but-valid PNG files,
potentially leading to crashes, information leakage, or remote code
execution on unpatched systems that use the widely bundled Linux/Unix
library. Although the rarely used vulnerable function lowers practical
severity, security experts warn that AI-powered bug-hunting tools are
accelerating the discovery of similar dormant vulnerabilities across
open-source libraries, increasing the risk of threat-actor
exploitation before coordinated disclosure. 

 LIGHTLLM: UNAUTHENTICATED RCE VIA PICKLE DESERIALIZATION IN WEBSOCKET
ENDPOINTS (4 MINUTE READ) [6] 

 A critical unauthenticated RCE vulnerability (CVE-2026-26220, CVSS
9.3) has been revealed in LightLLM, a widely used LLM inference engine
with 3,890 GitHub stars. The flaw involves WebSocket endpoints in the
prefill-decode disaggregation system calling pickle.loads() on
unauthenticated binary frames, and the server code explicitly
disallows binding to localhost, exposing the server to network threats
by design. This vulnerability mirrors CVE-2025-32444 (CVSS 10.0) in
vLLM and underscores a broader issue of insecure deserialization
across ML inference frameworks, as disaggregated serving architectures
create additional attack surfaces between nodes. Organizations using
LightLLM in PD mode should immediately restrict network access to
WebSocket endpoints, as the maintainers have largely ignored security
reports for nearly a year without providing a fix. 

 NEW CHROME ZERO-DAY (CVE-2026-2441) UNDER ACTIVE ATTACK — PATCH
RELEASED (2 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Google patched CVE-2026-2441 (CVSS 8.8), a use-after-free
vulnerability in Chrome's CSS engine actively exploited in the wild,
marking the first Chrome zero-day of 2026. The flaw allowed remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via crafted HTML
pages in versions prior to 145.0.7632.75. Users should immediately
update Chrome on all platforms, and organizations using Chromium-based
browsers such as Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi should apply fixes as
they become available.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TRACKING DIGITSTEALER: HOW OPERATOR PATTERNS EXPOSED C2
INFRASTRUCTURE (6 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 An infrastructure analysis of DigitStealer, a macOS infostealer
targeting 18 cryptocurrency wallets and Apple M2 devices, revealed
that the operator's consistent use of a single Swedish ASN (ab stract
ltd), Tucows domain registration, Njalla nameservers, and identical
OpenSSH versions created a fingerprint that enabled clustering of
previously unreported C2 domains. The malware operates as a persistent
backdoor via Launch Agent, polling C2 endpoints every 10 seconds and
using a cryptographic challenge-response mechanism for anti-analysis,
while communicating over four distinct API endpoints for credential
theft, file exfiltration, and command execution. The infrastructure
uniformity strongly suggests a closed, single-operator campaign rather
than a MaaS model — a reminder that when threat actors prioritize
efficiency over operational security, defenders can exploit these
patterns to proactively identify and burn C2 assets. 

 THE CISO'S CRAFT: WATCHMAKER OR GARDENER? (3 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This post examines two distinct models of CISO leadership: the
Watchmaker, which focuses on precision, strict controls, and
auditability, and the Gardener, which promotes an adaptable security
culture, team empowerment, and organizational resilience. The
Watchmaker style works well in regulated settings but can lead to
rigidity and burnout. In contrast, the Gardener encourages shared
responsibility but depends on high organizational trust and long-term
cultural commitment. The most successful CISOs combine elements of
both—building strong foundational controls while fostering an
adaptable security environment that evolves with emerging threats. 

 KEY OPENCLAW RISKS, CLAWDBOT, MOLTBOT (8 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 OpenClaw, previously known as Clawdbot, is a viral open-source AI
assistant flagged as a major insider threat due to security flaws such
as CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS score 8.8), insecure defaults (e.g., disabled
authentication), plaintext secret storage, and a malicious skills
ecosystem targeted by infostealers such as RedLine and AMOS. Its
design includes privileged host access, exposure to untrusted data,
and external communication capabilities. Organizations should detect
OpenClaw through specific file paths, network signatures, and unusual
OAuth activity, while reducing shadow AI risks with application
allowlisting, least-privilege policies, isolated deployments, and
transparent usage policies with staff training.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 ZERO-DAY BLOCKED: HOW HAPROXY ONE SHIELDED AGAINST REACT2SHELL
(SPONSOR) [11] 

 Traditional WAFs react too late. HAProxy One's advanced machine
learning and global edge threat intelligence proactively shielded
customers from zero-day threats like React2Shell, detecting the attack
at the edge before a patch was available without impacting latency.

 AWS-CONFIG-D (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 aws-config-d splits the monolithic ~/.aws/config file into
per-organization files under a config.d/ directory, automatically
concatenating them via a shell hook on session start — useful for
security teams and consultants managing SSO profiles across multiple
AWS organizations. The tool includes SHA-256 drift detection that
warns when external changes (such as aws configure sso) modify the
config outside the managed workflow, preventing silent overwrites of
carefully scoped access configurations. It supports bash, zsh, and
fish with zero dependencies and ships with 42 containerized tests
covering rebuild triggers, migration, and idempotency. 

 KASADA (PRODUCT LAUNCH) [13] 

 Kasada is a cloud-based anti-bot security platform that protects
websites, APIs, and mobile apps from malicious automated traffic such
as scraping, credential stuffing, account takeover, and online fraud
using adaptive, invisible bot detection instead of CAPTCHAs. 

 SANDBOXEXEC (GITHUB REPO) [14] 

 A lightweight command sandbox for Linux, secure-by-default, built on
Landlock. Use it to run risky commands with a tighter blast radius:
third-party CLIs, untrusted scripts, generated code, and one-off
tooling.

 AMAZON SCRAPS PARTNERSHIP WITH SURVEILLANCE COMPANY AFTER SUPER BOWL
AD BACKLASH (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Ring has canceled a planned integration with Flock Safety after
public backlash over a Super Bowl ad featuring AI-powered neighborhood
tracking and broader concerns about a “dystopian” surveillance
ecosystem. The integration never launched, so no customer footage was
shared. The controversy amplified scrutiny of Ring's facial
recognition features and Flock's vast license-plate tracking network
amid mounting privacy and civil liberties criticism. 

 DUTCH COPS ARREST MAN AFTER SENDING HIM CONFIDENTIAL FILES BY MISTAKE
(4 MINUTE READ) [16] 

 Dutch police accidentally gave a Ridderkerk man access to
confidential documents by sending a download instead of an upload
link, then arrested him for refusing to delete them without
compensation. Officers seized his devices, reported a data breach, and
charged him with unauthorized access. 

 260K+ CHROME USERS DUPED BY FAKE AI BROWSER EXTENSIONS (4 MINUTE
READ) [17] 

 More than 30 lookalike Chrome extensions posing as AI assistants have
siphoned email, browser data, and sensitive inputs from over 260,000
users, including corporate environments. Attackers embed a full-screen
iframe that proxies real LLM APIs while exfiltrating content and API
keys, evading Chrome Web Store review due to minimal local permissions
and off-platform malicious logic.
