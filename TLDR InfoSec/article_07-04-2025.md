 THE FUTURE OF CLOUD WAAP AND HOW TO SECURE IT (SPONSOR) [4] 

 Modern applications and APIs are fueling rapid digital
transformation—but they're also expanding attack surfaces. As
threats evolve, enterprises must rethink their web application and API
protection (WAAP) strategies. [4]

This Gartner report [4] provides critical guidance for navigating
today's WAAP landscape, including:

 	* The cloud WAAP market today and where it's headed in the future
 	* Cloud WAAP capabilities
 	* The Representative Vendors offering cloud WAAP solutions
 	* Recommendations by Gartner for implementing cloud WAAP

ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 PORT OF SEATTLE‘S AUGUST DATA BREACH IMPACTED 90,000 PEOPLE (2
MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The Port of Seattle experienced a ransomware attack in August 2024
that disrupted its websites and phone systems, including
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The breach affected the personal
data of 90,000 individuals, prompting the Port to offer free credit
monitoring and notify those impacted. The responsible group, Rhysida,
has previously targeted multiple industries and organizations. 

 ORACLE TELLS CLIENTS OF SECOND RECENT HACK, LOG-IN DATA STOLEN (2
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Oracle is warning customers that a hacker broke into a computing
system twice in one month. Customer data, including login data, was
stolen from a legacy environment that has not been used for eight
years. However, customer log-in credentials from as recently as 2024
were stolen. 

 CARDING TOOL ABUSING WOOCOMMERCE API DOWNLOADED 34K TIMES (2 MINUTE
READ) [7] 

 Researchers from Socket have discovered a malicious PyPi package
called disgrasya. The tool abuses legitimate WooCommerce sites to
validate cards using an attacker-controlled site masquerading as
CyberSource. This package is particularly notable in that it does not
abuse typosquatting or any other evasion technique but is instead
overtly malicious.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 TAMING THE WILD WEST OF ML: PRACTICAL MODEL SIGNING WITH SIGSTORE (5
MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Google launched a stable version of its model-signing library with
NVIDIA and HiddenLayer to secure the machine learning supply chain.
The library enables users to verify that a model used in an
application is the one created by developers using digital signatures
like those from Sigstore. This counters security threats from the
multi-stage ML development (training, fine-tuning, and deployment),
where malicious actors can tamper with models via weight alterations,
backdoors, or code injection. 

 POWERUSERACCESS VS ADMINISTRATORACCESS FROM AN ATTACKER'S PERSPECTIVE
(6 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 PowerUserAccess is a broad managed permission for AWS that explicitly
restricts a user's access to some actions related to IAM,
Organizations, and Account. Attackers can often accomplish one-time
goals such as crypto mining or ransomware with PowerUserAccess but
would require AdministratorAccess to establish persistence. However,
in practice, attackers can often find an overly permissive resource to
exploit to escalate privileges due to PowerUserAccess violating the
principle of least privilege. 

 SECURE YOUR CONTAINER IMAGES WITH SIGNATURE VERIFICATION (8 MINUTE
READ) [10] 

 Signature verification and image signing enhance supply chain
resiliency by ensuring image integrity. DataDog created a signing
service for signing images to facilitate adoption across varied CI/CD
processes that stored signatures in an OCI-compliant registry and
verified these signatures. It managed signature verification during
image pulls as a containerd plugin rather than through an admission
webhook to prevent cluster-level dependencies in the Kubernetes
control plane's hot path.

LAUNCHES & TOOLS

 GOOGLE ANNOUNCES SEC-GEMINI V1, A NEW EXPERIMENTAL CYBERSECURITY
MODEL (2 MINUTE READ) [11] 

 Google has launched Sec-Gemini v1, an experimental AI model that
boosts cybersecurity. It merges advanced features with real-time
knowledge, outperforming other models in key benchmarks. Sec-Gemini v1
empowers defenders with detailed threat analysis and vulnerability
insights. 

 ENOLA (GITHUB REPO) [12] 

 Enola is a Golang CLI tool that helps you find accounts by username
across social media services. 

 DETECTRAPTOR (GITHUB REPO) [13] 

 Detectraptor is a repository to share detection content and queries
for Velociraptor.

 EXPERT USED CHATGPT-4O TO CREATE A REPLICA OF HIS PASSPORT IN JUST 5
MINUTES BYPASSING KYC (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 A researcher used ChatGPT-4o to quickly create a fake passport
realistic enough to fool automated KYC systems. This raises concerns
about the security of relying solely on photo-based verification
methods. Experts suggest upgrading to digitally verified identity
solutions to combat the growing threat of identity theft. 

 MICROSOFT CREDITS ENCRYPTHUB, HACKER BEHIND 618+ BREACHES, FOR
DISCLOSING WINDOWS FLAWS (3 MINUTE READ) [15] 

 Microsoft has credited EncryptHub for uncovering Windows security
flaws, highlighting a conflicted figure in cybersecurity and
cybercrime. EncryptHub, or SkorikARI, was linked to multiple malware
campaigns against high-value targets. Despite its technical skill,
EncryptHub's inadequate security practices ultimately led to exposure
and arrest during the Russo-Ukrainian war. 

 CHINA WILL ENFORCE CLEAR FLAGGING OF ALL AI GENERATED CONTENT (2
MINUTE READ) [16] 

 China's National Internet censor just announced new rules requiring
all AI-generated content to include clearly visible or audible
watermarks to indicate that it is AI-generated. Users can omit the
label in some circumstances, but the AI generator must warn users of
the requirement and log any requests to ignore it. These regulations
will go into effect on September 1.

distribute BeaverTail and Tropidoor malware, which steals information,
downloads additional payloads, and provides backdoor access. 

 NSA AND GLOBAL ALLIES DECLARE FAST FLUX A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT (3
MINUTE READ) [19]
