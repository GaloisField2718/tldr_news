ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 CASIO SAYS HACKERS STOLE PERSONAL DATA OF 8,500 PEOPLE DURING OCTOBER
RANSOMWARE ATTACK (2 MINUTE READ) [4] 

 Casio confirmed that an October ransomware attack by the Underground
gang compromised the personal data of 8,500 people, including 6,500
employees and 1,900 business partners. The attack stole 200GB of data,
though customer credit card information remained secure. 

 TURBULENCE AT UN AVIATION AGENCY AS PROBE INTO POTENTIAL DATA THEFT
BEGINS (3 MINUTE READ) [5] 

 The UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is
investigating a potential data breach after cybercriminal "Natohub"
claimed to have stolen 42,000 documents containing personal
information. ICAO previously faced a 2016 cyberattack that they
allegedly attempted to cover up. 

 MISCONFIGURED LICENSE PLATE READERS ARE LEAKING DATA IN REAL TIME (3
MINUTE READ) [6] 

 Security Researcher Matt Brown purchased and reverse engineered the
firmware of a Motorola automated license plate reader (ALPR) system.
Brown used a unique error page to find 150 Internet exposed Motorola
ALPR systems that did not implement any form of authentication. Wired
journalists confirmed that these cameras are deployed by law
enforcement and are leaking license plate number, car location, make
and model, and other metadata from thousands of cars in just 20
minutes of sample time.

STRATEGIES & TACTICS

 USING THE MACH-O MODULE IN YARA-X (4 MINUTE READ) [7] 

 This post introduces some of the improvements that the new Yara-X
Mach-O module makes over the original. The new Mach-O module parses
many of the core structures that are used in Mach-O binaries including
the symbol table, imports, exports, entitlements, remote paths, and
dylibs. The module also allows for calculating binary similarities by
hashing the above structures. 

 ATTACKING ENTRA METAVERSE: PART 1 (7 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Part 1 of a series of blog posts exploring the Entra metaverse and
demonstrating attacks against it. It introduces the concept of the
Entra metaverse and demonstrates how the compromise of an Entra user
can be used to fully compromise an on-premise AD user. The following
posts explore cross-domain attacks and argue that the Entra Tenant is
your trust boundary when using Entra. 

 CROSS CACHE ATTACK CHEATSHEET (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 This article describes a technique called "cross-cache attack" in
Linux kernel exploitation that allows transferring a Use-After-Free
(UAF) vulnerability from one object to another, even if they're
allocated from different slabs. The attack involves a five-step
process: spraying object-A sharing a slab with object-V, allocating a
victim object-V, freeing object-V, freeing specific objects to trigger
slab recycling through the buddy system, and finally spraying object-B
to overlap with the freed object-V's memory. The article provides
detailed code examples and experimental results, including a
timing-based technique called SLUBStick that helps determine the state
of slab allocation in the kernel.

 11 THOUGHTS ON “A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PROLIFIC VOICE PHISHING
CREW” (12 MINUTE READ) [13] 

 Brian Krebs has notes on a sophisticated voice phishing operation
called "Crypto Chameleon" that is exploiting Apple and Google's
legitimate services to scam cryptocurrency owners, using a coordinated
team approach and phishing panels to steal millions from victims
including billionaire Mark Cuban, while operating openly on messaging
platforms like Discord and Telegram where the criminals frequently
betray each other. 

 800+ “POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES AND BIASES” MAY AFFLICT
AI-INFUSED MEDICAL SERVICES (2 MINUTE READ) [14] 

 The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) led an
effort in coordination with the Crowdsourced AI Red-Teaming Assurance
Program and healthcare agencies to evaluate the usage of LLMs in
military medical services. The over 200 participants evaluated three
popular LLMs for a clinical note summarization and advisory Chatbot.
The effort was concluded with over 800 potential vulnerabilities and
biases identified with suggested improvements to reduce the number in
future efforts. 

 BACKDOORING YOUR BACKDOORS - ANOTHER $20 DOMAIN, MORE GOVERNMENTS (13
MINUTE READ) [15] 

 WatchTowr Labs researchers discovered over 4,000 active web backdoors
that were hijacked by registering expired domains. The backdoors
allowed unauthorized access to high-profile targets like government
and university systems. The domains are now managed by The
Shadowserver Foundation to prevent misuse by cybercriminals.
