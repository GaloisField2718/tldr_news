ATTACKS & VULNERABILITIES

 ELECTRICITY PROVIDER TIBBER HACKED, 50K GERMAN CUSTOMERS AFFECTED (2
MINUTE READ) [7] 

 Tibber is a provider of green energy options for customers in
Northern Europe and Germany. It reported that customer data belonging
to 50K German customers of its smart hardware online store was stolen.
The leaked data includes names, email addresses, order amounts, and
incomplete address data. 

 NORTH KOREAN-LINKED HACKERS WERE CAUGHT EXPERIMENTING WITH NEW MACOS
MALWARE (2 MINUTE READ) [8] 

 Three variants of a new macOS malware have been detected. One variant
was written in Python, one in Golang, and one using Flutter, which
heavily obfuscates code by default. The malware was embedded in a
clone of Minesweeper. No evidence of exploitation has been found - the
callback domain returns a 404. The malware appeared to target
cryptocurrency developers. It had several of the hallmarks of a
Lazarus group attack. 

 UNPATCHED REMOTE CODE EXECUTION IN GOGS (4 MINUTE READ) [9] 

 The Gogs self-hosted Git service version 0.13.0 has a vulnerability
(CVE-2024-44625) that allows remote code execution. Attackers can
exploit this by gaining access to an account that can push to a
repository and editing files from the web interface. The issue remains
unaddressed by Gogs developers despite multiple reports, prompting
users to take security measures and consider migrating to Gitea.

 SELINUX BYPASSES (23 MINUTE READ) [10] 

 This in-depth guide to bypassing SELinux on Android devices begins
with an overview of how SELinux works and breaks down the relevant
sections of the implementation code. It then discusses some bypasses
that don't work either for hypervisor blocks or read only memory such
as disabling SELinux by setting the enforcing mode to permissive,
overwriting the permissive map, AV Cache poisoning, and SELinux
initialization overwriting. Two bypasses that do eventually work
involve overwriting the SELinux hooks and overwriting the
allow_unknown field in the selinux_state.

 NIST SAYS EXPLOITED BACKLOG CLEARED BUT END-OF-YEAR GOAL FOR FULL
LIST UNLIKELY (2 MINUTE READ) [17] 

 This past February, NIST announced that it did not have enough
resources to keep up with the CVE enrichment backlog and stated that
changes would be made to keep up. Now, the NIST has announced that it
is fully staffed, has partnered with other federal agencies and
industry partners, and has provided enriched CVE data for all
vulnerabilities in the KEV. However, NIST also stated that the format
that it receives data from its Authorized Data Provider is difficult
to import and enhance. 

 ATTACK OF THE EVIL BARISTAS (5 MINUTE READ) [18] 

 A common cybersecurity trope is to never use unsecured, public WiFi
without a VPN. The author of this article challenged this notion by
monitoring the HTTPS and non-HTTPS connections made by their iPhone
and Chromebook. They found that anyone monitoring their connection
could only see 0.25% of requests from their Chromebook and that there
were zero connections to HTTP websites and services from their iPhone.
