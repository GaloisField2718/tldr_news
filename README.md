# TLDR Newsletter

## Init 

This repo is built with `pipenv`.

```
pipenv shell
> pipenv install
> python3 script.py
```

## Repository

The repository is structured around each categories from **TLDR newsletter**. Each email is saved in format `articles_{date_reception}.md` in corresponding folder.

The `ids.txt` file is used to save each email's id to be able to not do again the treatment if it's already done.

## TODO

Links are not effective for most of links. I'm still working to find a solution. Feel free to try any solutions. I hope to solve this issue as soon as possible :)

Automate treatment.
